<h2>A Youth's Skill in Observation</h2>

<p>A proud youth proved he could draw accurately from observation.</p>

<p>"I can draw accurately from observation!"</p>

<p>But it took a lot of time, and he found it very difficult to capture moving subjects.</p>

<h2>Turning to Photography</h2>

<p>He bought a camera. It took less time and captured moving subjects beautifully. He copied the photos and beheld a drawing that looked a lot like the photo.</p>

<p>Eventually, he discovered that processing a photo created a very impressive picture that looked a bit like what the camera saw but with attractive blotch marks all over it.</p>

<p>"I have created art!"</p>

<h2>Parental Concern</h2>

<p>His father objected.</p>

<p>"Is this what you want to do to manifest your creative self? Push buttons on the computer? Click the camera shutter? Take countless hours to copy what's in front of you?"</p>

<p>"It's not exactly copying, and it can be quite beautiful," he replied.</p>

<p>His mother joined in.</p>

<p>"I didn't raise my son to just copy things. Get your act together and do something original."</p>

<h2>An Attempt at Originality</h2>

<p>So the child grudgingly got his act together, gave it a shot, and drew this. Which pleased his parents even less. But at least he had moved beyond mere copying what he saw.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, he didn't live long enough to reach his potential. But the spark of creativity was there, and your story may offer a more positive ending.</p>

<h2>The Moral of the Story</h2>

<p>The lesson, of course, is: <strong>learn how to draw, not just copy</strong>. And always listen to your parents. Unless they're wrong. In this case, they were right.</p>

<p>"Let's try again!"</p>
