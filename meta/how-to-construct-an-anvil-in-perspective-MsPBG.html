<h2>Starting with the Base Box</h2>

<p>I begin by drawing the base of the box using a straight edge, making the lines nice and dark so I know what they represent. The <strong>height</strong>, <strong>width</strong>, and <strong>depth</strong> are crucial in this process. I draw the vertical <strong>height lines</strong>, keeping them light since the front corner of the box isn't that important in the final drawing.</p>

<h2>Determining Dimensions</h2>

<p>I decide how tall to make the box and adjust the depth accordingly. If the depth looks too deep, I trim it to make it credible compared to the orthographic (ortho) views. Finding the <strong>center</strong> of the front plane helps me measure back accurately.</p>

<h2>Projecting Lines and Finding Centers</h2>

<p>I run lines back on the <strong>X line</strong> and down to the base. By connecting points, I establish sections like the <strong>coronal</strong> and <strong>transverse planes</strong>. I use these to build the structure without overdoing the structural lines, keeping them light to avoid confusion.</p>

<h2>Building the Base and Midsection</h2>

<p>To build the base, I compare distances and use halfway points. I connect the dots to form rectangles, ensuring the proportions match the ortho views. I estimate the dimensions rather than making them exact, allowing for some liberties in the drawing.</p>

<h2>Adding Key Features</h2>

<p>To place the <strong>horn (bick)</strong> of the anvil, I find the center of the far plane. I estimate heights and widths, noting that some features extend beyond the halfway points. Using straight lines simplifies the curves initially. From corners, I draw lines to establish the main forms.</p>

<h2>Refining the Structure</h2>

<p>I add curves by adjusting the straight lines. Drawing <strong>cross-contour lines</strong> helps represent the three-dimensional form transparently, relying on lines rather than rendering. I erase unnecessary lines to avoid confusion and clarify the drawing.</p>

<h2>Focusing on Line Quality</h2>

<p>Paying attention to <strong>line quality</strong> is important. While it's essential to make the first lines clean, sometimes adjustments are necessary. Stan emphasizes this in the basics course, where exercises help develop that graceful line indicative of heightened sensibilities and refined tastes.</p>

<h2>Finalizing the Drawing</h2>

<p>I add the curves of the horn and base, emphasizing the anvil's underplanes and contours. Darkening baselines that touch the floor adds emphasis. By adjusting line weights and cleaning up the drawing, I strive to make it look more professional.</p>

<p>At the end, I'll scan the drawing so you can look at the high-resolution version and perhaps say, "Oh gosh, I can do better than that."</p>
