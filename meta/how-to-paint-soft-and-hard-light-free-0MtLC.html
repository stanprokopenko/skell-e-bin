<h2>What's in Premium?</h2>

<p>In this premium lesson, you'll dive into the fundamentals of light in painting. Learn about different light sources—like the sun and artificial lights—and how they affect your artwork. We cover light falloff and the impact of distance on light intensity. Understand the differences between hard and soft light, and how to depict them to add depth and realism. Explore scattering, occlusion shadows, and reflected light to see how light interacts with surfaces. Practical applications and assignments are included to help you apply these concepts in your own paintings.</p>
