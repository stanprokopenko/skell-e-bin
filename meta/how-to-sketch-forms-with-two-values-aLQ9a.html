<h2>Why Simplicity Matters</h2>

<p>I believe in making things simple, yet expressive. When we focus on an intuitive understanding of the world, our drawings become more direct and powerful. This applies to learning any craft, especially figurative realism, because there are so many individual skills to master. Rather than getting stuck in rigid scientific rules for light, anatomy, and perspective, I like to start with a simple approach that captures most of what we need.</p>

<h2>The 80-20 Rule</h2>

<p>I rely on the 80-20 rule to make learning more efficient. Out of everything I can do to improve my art, about 20% of the tasks produce 80% of the results. Those big tasks, or <strong>needle movers</strong>, should be the first things I practice. Refining them gets me most of the way there. Once that foundation is solid, all the extra details, though important, only refine my work further.</p>

<h2>Two Sides of the Form</h2>

<p>I start by drawing <strong>two sides of the form</strong>. The form might be a cylindrical ribcage, a blocky torso, or anything else. I think of those two edges in a simple, 2D way, because it helps me organize my drawing before worrying about 3D structure. Later, I might add ends or construction lines that wrap over the form to make it look volumetric.</p>

<p>Focusing on just two sides also helps me compare relationships: top to bottom, left to right, or any significant angles. It keeps me from getting overwhelmed by the more complicated areas in a figure, like where the ribcage meets the shoulder girdle or hips.</p>

<h2>Constructing Light and Shadow with Two Values</h2>

<p>When I’m ready to apply light and shadow, I break it down into <strong>two clear values</strong>:</p>

<ol>

<li><strong>Light side</strong> – I use the white or toned paper (or the canvas color) as the light.</li>

<li><strong>Shadow side</strong> – I fill in the shape of the shadow with a darker value.</li>

</ol>

<h3>The Process</h3>

<ol>

<li>Draw two sides of the form.  </li>

<li>Outline the shape of the shadow on that form.  </li>

<li>Fill the shadow shape with a dark value.  </li>

<li>Squint at the drawing to check if the shadow is dark enough.</li>

</ol>

<p>By doing this, I get an immediate read of where the light hits and where it doesn’t. If my shadow is too light, everything looks washed out. If it’s too dark, it might become too graphic. Sometimes I soften the edge of the shadow shape, making it a soft line, as a transition from light to dark. That sets me up to render more refined gradations later.</p>

<h2>The Power of Value in Color</h2>

<p>Color has three aspects: <strong>value, temperature</strong>, and <strong>intensity</strong>. Value is the most critical because it does the heavy lifting for creating the illusion of volume and space. When value is correct, small shifts in temperature (warm versus cool) or intensity (bright versus subdued) are less disruptive.</p>

<p>• <strong>Value</strong>: The lightness or darkness of color.<br />

• <strong>Temperature</strong>: Warm or cool hues.<br />

• <strong>Intensity</strong>: How bright, dull, or gray a color is.</p>

<p>If value is off, no amount of perfect color temperature or intensity will save the drawing. Luckily, we can treat value as somewhat separate. By nailing our light and dark areas first, we get a strong foundation for color later.</p>

<h2>Practice and Iteration</h2>

<p>I repeat this process often:</p>

<p>• Draw two sides of the form.<br />

• Add a soft-edged shadow shape.<br />

• Fill the shadow with a dark value.<br />

• Squint to check if my lights and darks feel balanced.</p>

<p>I keep refining until the form reads clearly. Sometimes I adjust how dark my core shadow is so it stays grouped with the overall shadow rather than looking like a separate band. My personal taste might lead me to go darker or lighter, depending on the style or mood. If I’m aiming for a delicate, softly lit look like a Boucher or Fragonard painting, I might keep shadows lighter. If I want a bold, graphic effect, I’ll push them darker.</p>

<p>In the end, this two-value approach helps me improve faster. More nuanced details and refinements come with practice, but starting with a strong grasp of <strong>light side vs. shadow side</strong> provides a solid structure for any drawing or painting.</p>
