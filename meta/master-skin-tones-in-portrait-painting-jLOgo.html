<p><strong>Setting Up Materials</strong></p>

<p>To start, I ensure my workspace is ready by using a <strong>spray fix</strong>. This keeps the environment <strong>dry and odorless</strong>, making it comfortable to work in the studio. I set up my <strong>four main colors</strong>: ketchup, mustard, black, and white lace. This setup is quick and efficient. I also prepare my <strong>medium mixture</strong>, which remains consistent with what I've used before.</p>

<p><strong>Mixing Colors for Shadows</strong></p>

<p>I begin by mixing an <strong>average shadow</strong>. I use a <strong>neutral gray value</strong> already on the canvas to test my colors. For the shadow, I mix <strong>black with ketchup and mustard</strong>. To lighten the shadow, I add <strong>yellow ocher pale</strong>. To introduce warmth, I incorporate <strong>alizarin crimson</strong>, which results in a <strong>dark brown</strong> without needing white. The painting is done in <strong>north light</strong>, known for its coolness, which influences my color choices.</p>

<p><strong>Adjusting for Skin Tones</strong></p>

<p>The subject has <strong>light skin</strong>, so I start fresh with my paint. I test the <strong>warmth and value</strong> of the shadow on the board. The average skin color is prepared with <strong>subtle modeling</strong>, avoiding bright highlights or dark halftones. The subject's skin appears <strong>dry</strong>, unlike older skin with many halftones. I use <strong>black to cool down</strong> any warm patches, ensuring accuracy.</p>

<p><strong>Balancing Light and Shadow</strong></p>

<p>I am satisfied with the <strong>shadow and light ratio</strong> and continue testing for balance. For the <strong>lightest tones</strong>, like the light on the subject's forehead, I adjust accordingly. I mix a <strong>half tone</strong> from scratch, making it slightly warmer as it transitions into shadow. Adding <strong>white to the light mixture</strong> is appropriate due to the cool light. The half tone should relate to the average light, appearing as a <strong>darker version</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Preparing Hair Color</strong></p>

<p>For the subject's <strong>red hair</strong>, I mix an <strong>average hair color</strong> a few values darker than the skin tone. I intensify the hair color with more <strong>ketchup and mustard</strong> to achieve the desired red look. I store these mixed colors in <strong>cheap cups</strong> to prevent drying, labeling them for easy access. While these cups extend the paint's usability during the painting process, they won't keep it fresh for a week.</p>

<p><strong>Techniques and Considerations</strong></p>

<p>Mixing colors ahead of time is crucial. It improves skills and understanding of <strong>warm and cool versions</strong> of colors. Storing paint properly extends its usability, allowing for a smoother painting process. This careful preparation and technique are essential for achieving the desired <strong>color balance</strong> in a painting.</p>
