<p>I've had the pleasure of sitting down with Dan, the former head of story development at Riot Games. His team was responsible for much of the marketing and cinematics for games like <strong>League of Legends</strong> and <strong>Valorant</strong>, including the season starts. In our conversation, we dove into his thoughts on creativity and what it takes to make something that resonates with people on a large scale.</p>

<h2>Following Your Instincts and Creating Your Own Destiny</h2>

<p>Based on my experience, if you're going to be a creative person and do it for a living, <strong>you can do anything you want</strong>. It might sound simple or even crazy, but as the saying goes, "In order to predict your future, you must create your own destiny."</p>

<p><strong>You have to listen to your instinct and follow your gut</strong>. People might tell you "no" because they're listening to their own perspectives. You can't rely on anyone else's viewpoint, you have to invest in and trust the process. When you're actively doing it, and you keep at it, you are building your own world. I like to think of it as making your own mountain. How big that mountain becomes depends on you, and it gives you the perspective to see the elevation you have achieved. But that only comes by doing the work.</p>

<h2>The Importance of Loving the Process</h2>

<p>If you don't love the process You have to wake up and say, "I love drawing," or whatever your creative outlet is. It's that moment of creation that you live for, the act of making something interesting in that moment.</p>

<p>People often focus on the end result, the dreams of being rich and famous, but without goals, dreams will inevitably lead to disappointment. It takes commitment and consistency. <strong>If you can be consistent and deliver day in and day out, you can achieve your goals.</strong></p>

<h2>Setting Goals and Embracing Consistency</h2>

<p>You have to know how to articulate your goals. For example, **"Today, I'm going to draw 500 hands." ** Through that output, you're getting your footing to make that slow climb of progress. At the end of the month, when you look back and see that you've drawn 10,000 hands, you can see the difference in your work. It's in those micro-expressions and explorations where you make mistakes and learn from them, that's where evolution happens.</p>

<p>Progress comes from taking that step every day. Sometimes, you're just looking at your feet and moving forward, but when you look back, you realize how far you've come.</p>

<h2>Balancing Practicality and Passion</h2>

<p>Balancing the practical nature of being a person, paying bills, surviving, having health insurance, with pursuing your passion is crucial. You have to love what you do so much that you're willing to choose it over other activities. Drawing has to be more interesting to you than jet skiing, or hanging out with friends.</p>

<p>At a certain point, you might have to compromise, selling your services to get an income, to pay rent. <strong>Business is a huge factor</strong>. If any artist is going to learn anything, you'd better learn Business 101, how to make your work work for you.</p>

<h2>Overcoming Nihilism and Finding Meaning</h2>

<p>It's easy to talk yourself out of doing those hand studies or head studies. You look at the distant peak of working at a big company and think, "One day I could do that." But you have to appreciate the journey. Passion forges expertise, and that know-how comes from the work you did, those drawings in the margins, the practices that seemed insignificant at the time.</p>

<p>Sometimes, we feel nihilistic because we see the magnitude of success others have achieved, and it seems unattainable. But remember, <strong>they started small, too</strong>. You have to follow the thread, be willing to suffer through it, and build on the success of those small steps.</p>

<h2>The Value of Original Thought</h2>

<p>When hiring, I'm looking for people who can articulate what they want to get out of the experience: <strong>"I see what you're doing, and I see you don't have this, this, or this yet. I'd love to solve that problem."</strong></p>

<p>It's not necessarily about having the best work, it's about what you're thinking. At the end of the day, art is really just your process of thought. Everything that's created is the end of a thought or a series of thoughts. The more thinking you do, the more process understanding you have, that's your leverage.</p>

<h2>The Role of AI in Creativity</h2>

<p>I can't help but think about AI and its impact on creativity. This is the stuff that can't be replicated, the experiences of the artist, the moments that define worlds and make all of this possible. AI can't deliver the emotional depth that comes from human experiences.</p>

<p>I'm not mad at AI, but I'm not a fan of people stealing others' work. Using AI responsibly means it should never take away the authorship of thought. It should expedite processes, not replace the creative thinking that only humans can provide.</p>

<h2>Defining Success on Your Own Terms</h2>

<p>Success is subjective, it's up to you to define what it means. Does it mean you get to paint every day, or does it mean owning a house in the hills? Both are valid, depending on who you are.</p>

<p>Chasing validation from others or seeking fame and recognition isn't sustainable. <strong>The work should be the reward</strong>. If you're doing it for external validation, you'll always feel like it's never enough.</p>

<h2>The Impact of Creative Work on Others</h2>

<p>One of the most moving experiences I've had was receiving a letter from a woman who was battling cancer. She told me that watching our show gave her something to look forward to each week and helped her form a friendship with another patient. Our work gave her hope and companionship during a difficult time.</p>

<p>That's the kind of stuff that makes it all worth it, realizing that our creative efforts have a tangible effect on people's lives. <strong>Making people feel - that's what life is about</strong>.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p>We're all in this together, the grind, the doubts, the moments of joy. If you're out there doing the work, know that you're not alone. We all go through these experiences to make the stuff we love. The only person you have to compete with is yourself.</p>

<p>Keep creating, keep pushing, and remember why you started in the first place. <strong>Embrace the process, love the journey, and the rest will follow</strong>.</p>
