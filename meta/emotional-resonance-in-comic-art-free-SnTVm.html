<h2>What's in Premium?</h2>

<p>In this lesson, I share my journey in the comics industry, starting with my work on <strong>Alpha Flight</strong>, <strong>Longshot</strong>, and <strong>Punisher</strong>, leading up to the X-Books and co-founding <strong>Image Comics</strong>. I discuss how mentorship from Karl Potts at Marvel taught me the importance of storytelling and focus in art.</p>

<p>You'll learn about transitioning roles—from inking to penciling and writing—and how embracing both digital and traditional techniques can enhance your creativity. I explain how to direct the reader's eye by choosing a <strong>focal point</strong> in your scenes, and how combining digital layouts with traditional inking provides freedom in the creative process.</p>

<p>I also dive into creating meaningful art that resonates with people, sharing insights from covers like <strong>Wolverine</strong> and a personal favorite featuring <strong>Storm</strong>. This lesson emphasizes the power of storytelling, even in a single image, and how infusing emotion and backstory can make your artwork stand out.</p>
