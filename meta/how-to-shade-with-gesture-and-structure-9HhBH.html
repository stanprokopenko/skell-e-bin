<h2>Materials I Use</h2>

<p>I use <strong>Strathmore 500 series paper</strong> and <strong>Cont√© of Paris pencils</strong>, usually a 2B, but any will do. Sometimes, I use <strong>charcoal pencils</strong> from various brands. For rich darks, I prefer <strong>Alpha Color sticks</strong>, which come in square shapes like pastels. I use a <strong>kneaded eraser</strong>, preferably a dirty one, and a harder eraser for popping out highlights. A <strong>brush</strong> helps whisk away eraser debris, and a <strong>sanding pad</strong> keeps my <strong>stump</strong>, a rolled paper tool, ready for blending. A <strong>paper towel</strong> and my <strong>fingers</strong> are also essential for scrubbing in tones.</p>

<h2>Laying In the Figure: Gesture and Structure</h2>

<p>When I lay in a figure, I focus on understanding both the <strong>two-dimensional flat shape</strong> (graphic design) and the <strong>three-dimensional form</strong>. I'm always considering the <strong>structure</strong> (the volume and solidity) and the <strong>gesture</strong> (the life and movement). The goal is to find a <strong>beautiful shape</strong> for each body part and create a <strong>connective strategy</strong> between them.</p>

<p>Organic structures are mainly water, so they have a <strong>watery design</strong>, a series of <strong>curves and opposing curves</strong>. By finding the <strong>curves and S-curves</strong> along the <strong>long axis</strong> of any form, I can connect the body parts fluidly.</p>

<h2>Simplifying with Curves and Corners</h2>

<p>I start by drawing the <strong>long axis curves</strong>, which capture the gesture and flow down the form. Then, I add the <strong>short axis lines</strong>, moving across the form to give it volume and structure. <strong>Curves</strong> represent parts flowing together, while <strong>corners</strong> indicate where forms break away from each other.</p>

<p>For example, when drawing a tube, I sketch the two sides and the ends. By curving the sides, the tube appears more fluid and alive. The more curves I incorporate, the more dynamic the figure becomes.</p>

<h2>Shading Techniques</h2>

<p>I apply the same principles to shading. I draw the <strong>core shadow</strong> along the <strong>long axis curve</strong> of the form, a soft edge indicating where the form turns away from the light. Then, I fill in the <strong>shadow shape</strong>, and I make sure it's slightly darker than the light areas. This separation creates a sense of form and depth.</p>

<p>By <strong>softening the edges</strong> and extending them into <strong>gradations</strong>, I move the viewer over the form, enhancing the three-dimensional effect. I use a <strong>zigzag technique</strong> to blend, which can be tight for refined gradations or loose for a painterly feel.</p>

<h2>Rendering and Gradation</h2>

<p>I render by focusing on the <strong>biggest possible forms</strong> first, then refining smaller details. I <strong>blend over the form</strong> (side to side) and <strong>along the form</strong> (top to bottom) to create smooth gradations. It's essential to keep the <strong>shadows unified and darker</strong> than the light areas to maintain clarity.</p>

<p>When adding details like ribs or muscles, I use the same process: drawing the <strong>long axis curves</strong>, then blending and refining. I vary the spacing and intensity to avoid repetition and keep the figure organic and lifelike.</p>

<h2>Embracing Mistakes and Personal Style</h2>

<p>I often work <strong>fast and loose</strong>, and I embrace mistakes as opportunities. Drawing multiple lines can convey a sense of <strong>action and energy</strong>. For me, what's "right" isn't always matching the reference exactly, it's about capturing the <strong>essence and movement</strong> of the figure.</p>

<p>By redefining what's right for ourselves, we develop our <strong>style</strong>. Mistakes can lead to wonderful discoveries and add character to our work.</p>

<h2>Simplify and Connect</h2>

<p>When in doubt, I <strong>simplify</strong>. Breaking problems into manageable steps makes progress easier, and your audience will appreciate the clarity. Every mark I make, from the beginning to the end, aligns with my thinking about gesture and structure.</p>

<p>Remember, <strong>life is connected</strong>. The beauty in art often comes from how elements relate to each other. Whether through curves, gradations, or tonal relationships, focusing on connection brings unity and vitality to your drawings.</p>
