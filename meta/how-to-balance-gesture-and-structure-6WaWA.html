<h2>Understanding Gesture</h2>

<p>I like to think of <strong>gesture</strong> as the <strong>energy</strong> flowing through the figure. It’s that feeling of <strong>momentum</strong> or <strong>watery design</strong> that keeps forms alive, and constantly evolving. If I miss the gesture, my drawings risk looking stiff or lifeless, like a mannequin. Gesture brings out the essential quality of life in my work.</p>

<h2>Why Gesture Matters</h2>

<p>Our world is full of fluid movement, especially in <strong>living forms</strong>. Everything rises and falls, twists and flows. When I capture that fluidity, my drawings and paintings feel more natural and dynamic. Without gesture, I might have good structural skills but end up with art that lacks vitality.</p>

<h2>The Long Axis</h2>

<p>I focus on the <strong>long axis</strong> curve for each major form:

- Ribcage

- Waist

- Pelvis

- Thigh

- Calf

- Foot

- Arm

- Forearm

- Hand

- Fingers</p>

<p>At each joint, the form may bend in a new direction, creating either a <strong>curve</strong> or a <strong>corner</strong>. When I draw these long axes, I’m creating a <strong>connecting line</strong> that threads each part of the body together. This unbroken thread helps me keep the figure <strong>unified and fluid</strong>.</p>

<h2>Curves vs. Corners</h2>

<p>I like emphasizing <strong>curves</strong> because they give my drawings a more <strong>graceful, living</strong> quality. The more curves I find, the more interesting and active my figure feels. But not everything curves in the same way. Sometimes body parts change direction abruptly, creating <strong>corners</strong> and straights. Corners can help show structure and make forms feel solid.</p>

<p>I balance curves and corners to avoid two extremes:

- Making everything curvy can lead to a rubbery “Gumby” effect.<br />

- Making everything straight can lead to a stiff, mechanical look.</p>

<h2>Combining Gesture and Structure</h2>

<p>I don’t want to separate gesture from structure into two steps. Instead, I combine them:

1. I define the <strong>long axis</strong> with a slight or strong curve.<br />

2. I mark in the <strong>two-dimensional or three-dimensional</strong> shapes around that axis (tubes, boxes, or tapering forms).<br />

3. When one form ends and another begins, I check if it’s continuing the same direction (a curve) or changing direction (a corner).</p>

<p>This approach lets me maintain <strong>fluidity</strong> while keeping <strong>architectural clarity</strong>. If forms line up in a similar way, they might share a longer continuous curve. If they veer off in a new direction, I show that transition with a corner or angle.</p>

<h2>Balancing Moves</h2>

<p>When I notice something is too stiff, I add more <strong>curve</strong> to the long axis. When it’s too soft, I introduce sharper corners or straighter edges. I can always revise if I’m not sure. It’s better to start with a generous curve and then “carve” it down as needed, rather than missing out on the energy at the beginning.</p>

<h2>Bringing Out Your Creative Voice</h2>

<p>As I keep practicing, I start seeing all the <strong>complex shapes</strong> in the human body as simple, connected structures. At the same time, I can decide how much curving or cornering I want to emphasize for a personal style. The real magic happens when I combine my <strong>craft skills</strong> with my unique way of interpreting gesture. That’s where <strong>creative voice</strong> begins to shine.</p>

<p>I hope these ideas inspire you to see gesture and structure as a <strong>unified process</strong>. Bring <strong>life</strong> to your art by focusing on fluid connections and thoughtful shapes. Experiment with curves and corners until you find the <strong>balance</strong> that feels right for you.</p>
