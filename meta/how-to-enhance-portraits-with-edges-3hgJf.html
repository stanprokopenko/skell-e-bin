<h2>Establishing Dark Halftones</h2>

<p>When painting a portrait, I start by focusing on <strong>dark halftones</strong>. I mix black with alizarin crimson to keep the tones warm. These dark halftones are crucial for defining the <strong>shapes and edges</strong>, particularly around the hairline. I sometimes apply a dark halftone at the hairline to ensure clear color when playing with edges. It's important to push the limits of these darker tones, mixing them until they almost become part of the shadow, yet still calling them dark halftones. This approach helps establish the darker planes as they transition into shadows.</p>

<h2>Creating Depth with Light and Shadow</h2>

<p>In areas like beard growth and shaved hair, the combination of light and texture creates <strong>deeper halftones</strong> that aren't part of the shadow. For the lips, I add a slightly lighter shadow since they catch some light, ensuring they aren't pure black. Adding warmth to the lips as they come into the light is essential. Variation in tones is key to achieving the intended look, so I use averages like the dark halftones to see more accuracy in dark shapes.</p>

<h2>Enhancing Features with Color</h2>

<p>To enhance features like the chin and stubble, I add black and red to the dark halftones. This creates darker halftones that reflect the grain of hair against the skin, giving a sense of stubble. As the mustache starts to appear, I add a greater dark halftone. Around the eyes, I use alizarin crimson to add warmth, as the flesh touching flesh creates warm creases. These creases should have warmth to reflect humanity and blood flow. The crease on the side of the nose also warms up where flesh is close to flesh. I return to the original color to maintain the overall shadow pattern.</p>

<h2>Refining Details and Edges</h2>

<p>Reestablishing the drawing is crucial, ensuring details like the tip of the nose are accurate. The tip of the nose is brighter and requires more specific attention. While shadow areas are less important, focusing on what can be done without them is key. <strong>Edges</strong> play a significant role in storytelling, so it's time to establish them instead of relying solely on values. Basic values are established, but edges will help tell the story. Understanding edges is important for making informed decisions in painting.</p>

<h2>Finalizing the Painting</h2>

<p>Taking a break from painting to focus on edges can almost finish the piece. It's important to discuss the vocabulary of edges before working on them. This understanding allows for more informed decisions and can significantly complete the painting.</p>
