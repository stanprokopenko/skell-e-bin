<h2>Starting with Thumbnails</h2>

<p>When I begin a drawing, I start small with thumbnails. I'm not concerned with accuracy, I use them to note problems I need to solve. These initial sketches are for me alone, they're preliminary steps like those of Leonardo da Vinci, though without his grace and majesty. Thumbnails don't need to worry about style or skill, they simply get us started.</p>

<h2>Solving Perspective Problems</h2>

<p>As we move forward, we face perspective challenges to solve.</p>

<h3>Using Instruments</h3>

<p>One method involves using <strong>T-squares and triangles</strong>. If you're familiar with perspective, you'll recognize my approach. If not, I'll explain a bit as I go. This comes later in the course, but if you're ambitious, follow along.</p>

<h3>Depth Measuring System</h3>

<p>I use a depth measuring system to find far corners of distant rectangles. By running a line from a near corner through a central line, we find the next corners progressively. It's simple with instruments, but you can think this way freehand, as I did here. You'll learn this after mastering other concepts.</p>

<h2>Building Strong Foundations</h2>

<p>Before tackling complex perspective problems, prepare for a one-year pursuit. Early lessons may seem elementary, but they're crucial. You'll be glad later that you focused on the simple stuff first.</p>

<h3>Importance of Practice</h3>

<p>It's better to have a strong foundation, than to only know some tricks. Most of this is about depth measuring, which comes after mastering the cube. Arches have round tops solved with ellipses, the ends of cylinders pointing to vanishing points.</p>

<h3>Collecting Treasure</h3>

<p>You have a job: <strong>collect treasure</strong>. Gather images from artists and diagrams from perspective books. Even if they're not your style, see them as maps leading to more treasure.</p>

<h2>Looking Ahead</h2>

<p>Here's what's ahead, some easy and fun parts, some requiring concentration. Some combine hard work and fun challenges. Valuable lessons may seem like tedious repetition, but you'll be glad you did them. The hardest parts, cylinders, spheres, divisions, become surprisingly easy when cubes and axes are ingrained. I'll vary it up for you.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p>These demos show that <strong>perspective problems are solvable</strong> with pencil, straight edge, and knowledge, even without a straight edge. Remember, it doesn't happen all at once. Get used to multiple stages in your training. This may be used in a finished picture, or as an exercise to rehearse procedures.</p>

<p>I didn't start here, I started with little drawings that nobody sees. Thumbnailing lets us start without worry. In our next lessons, we'll talk more about <strong>process</strong>. We've got power.</p>
