<h2>Why I Use Color Temperature</h2>

<p>Talking about every hue by name is impossible. Even two identical reds can look different when they sit next to each other. Instead of naming colors, I think in <strong>color temperature</strong>. I ask, “Is this color <strong>warmer or cooler</strong> than the one beside it?” Warm hues and cool hues sit on opposite sides of the color wheel. When I move around that wheel, I travel from one temperature to the other.</p>

<h2>Movement on the Color Wheel</h2>

<p>I picture two train stops: <strong>Warm Station</strong> and <strong>Cool Station</strong>. Most of the ride happens <strong>between</strong> those stops. Painting works the same way. I rarely use the warmest or coolest color straight from the tube or picker. I mix intermediate steps that live somewhere along the track.</p>

<h2>Chart 1 – Moving with Hue Only</h2>

<p>I start with a simple chart.</p>

<ol>

<li>Put the warm hue on the left.  </li>

<li>Put the cool hue on the right.  </li>

<li>Sample the warm color, nudge the hue slider a little toward the cool side, and paint a swatch.  </li>

<li>Keep nudging and painting until I hit the center.  </li>

<li>Switch to the cool hue and walk the slider back toward the center, filling the gap.</li>

</ol>

<p>No value or saturation changes, only <strong>hue shifts</strong>. The swatches should touch so the temperature change feels fluid.</p>

<p><em>Example: A row of greens that drifts from yellow-green (warm) to blue-green (cool).</em></p>

<h2>Chart 2 – Moving with Saturation (Grays)</h2>

<p>Hue alone locks me into candy colors. I need a second tool: <strong>saturation</strong>.</p>

<ol>

<li>Drop a perfect gray in the middle of the chart.  </li>

<li>On the left, step from the warm hue toward that gray, reducing saturation each time.  </li>

<li>On the right, do the same with the cool hue.</li>

</ol>

<p>This chart slides from warm to cool <strong>through neutrals</strong>. A gray next to bright yellow looks cool. The same gray beside a bright blue looks warm. That chameleon shift teaches my eye how context changes color.</p>

<h2>Chart 3 – Combining Hue and Saturation</h2>

<p>The most flexible path blends both ideas.</p>

<ol>

<li>While shifting the hue, I also lower saturation.  </li>

<li>The result is a diagonal drift across the picker: hue turns, chroma drops.</li>

</ol>

<p>I can run this mix with any pair of hues. I often add a second version that loops the opposite way around the wheel so I never rely on one fixed route.</p>

<h2>Daily Warm-Up</h2>

<p>I like to begin a digital session by making one or two of these charts. It wakes up my eye and hand, and it cements the warm-to-cool journey in my mind.  </p>

<p>Tips:</p>

<p>• <strong>No gaps.</strong> Touching swatches show a seamless transition.<br />

• Always judge a swatch <strong>relative</strong> to its neighbors. Ask, “Is it warmer or cooler?”<br />

• Rotate through different hue pairs: reds to blues, yellows to violets, greens to oranges.</p>

<h2>Applying the Charts – A Sargent Example</h2>

<p>John Singer Sargent often painted with only a red, a yellow, and a blue. In one watercolor of Venice he let the <strong>archway</strong> act as its own mini chart.</p>

<ol>

<li>The left edge of the arch holds the warmest oranges.  </li>

<li>Moving along the curve, oranges cool into muted violets and finally into hints of blue.  </li>

<li>Saturation also shifts. The farther right I go, the slightly richer the cools become.  </li>

</ol>

<p>When I sample those colors and drop them into my combined chart, I see the full warm-to-cool path, even though no single spot of the painting displays every step. Sargent uses surrounding areas to supply missing links, so the whole picture completes the journey for the viewer.</p>

<p>If I repaint the arch with only one gray-violet from the center, the passage dies. Movement is gone and the surface looks dull. The lesson is clear: <strong>color temperature is about motion, not isolated swatches</strong>.</p>

<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>

<p>• Name colors by <strong>temperature</strong>, not by hue.<br />

• Think of warm and cool as <strong>train stops</strong> and keep your paint riding between them.<br />

• Practice three charts: <strong>Hue-Only, Saturation-Only, and Combined</strong>.<br />

• Grays are travelers, they change personality depending on their neighbors.

• In a finished painting, the warm-cool path can weave across the canvas. It does not need to live in every single shape.<br />

• Keep transitions seamless, avoid gaps, and always compare: “Is this spot warmer or cooler than that one?”</p>

<p>Use these small charts to strengthen your eye, clarify your palette, and bring lively temperature shifts into every painting you make.</p>
