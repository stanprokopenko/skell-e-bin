<h2>Critiques on Gestural Torso Boxes</h2>

<h3>Josue's Work</h3>

<p>Josue did a fantastic job with well-imagined boxes representing torso proportions. His line quality is loose but clear, with accurate angles and gestural motion.</p>

<h3>Lasuli's Work</h3>

<p>Lasuli's line quality is a bit messy but improves with darkened lines. I suggest switching to a brush with pressure sensitivity for better line quality.</p>

<h3>Martin's Work</h3>

<p>Martin's submissions are great but need more exaggeration in poses. For example, Martin's number 10 is too stiff compared to a more dynamic gesture. Exaggerating 10-20% helps avoid stiffness in final drawings.</p>

<h3>Maria's Work</h3>

<p>Maria found drawing from reference easier and asked about imagination skills. Her drawings are good but could use more confident lines. Subtle errors in angles and proportions can affect the overall look.</p>

<h3>Anderson's Work</h3>

<p>Anderson struggles with deciding angles of top and bottom faces due to natural tilts of the pelvis and rib cage. Reviewing torsos 9 and 11, I identified issues. Simplify the torso into a box and focus on the main gesture.</p>

<h3>Rachel's Work</h3>

<p>Rachel attempted level one and had difficulty with twisting. I suggest starting the S-curve sooner and filling in areas to avoid flat corners. Despite her struggles, her work shows promise.</p>

<h3>Sarah's Work</h3>

<p>Sarah needs cleaner line quality, though she has successful areas in her work. It's important to maintain the boxy effect and avoid flattening.</p>

<h3>Sashu's Work</h3>

<p>Sashu has a heavy-handed approach and needs to start with light lines. Have a clear vision of the form before committing to angles.</p>

<h2>General Drawing Techniques</h2>

<h3>Line Quality and Confidence</h3>

<p>Drawing confident lines is easier when you can visualize the plane better. Correcting initial shapes to fit the intended plane improves the drawing. Gradually work up to final lines rather than committing immediately.</p>

<h3>Perspective and Organic Forms</h3>

<p>Organic shapes in perspective can be challenging due to twists and turns. Simplify organic forms into boxes to apply perspective rules. Emphasize overlaps to convey volume and tightness.</p>

<h3>Exaggeration and Gesture</h3>

<p>Pushing the gesture to extremes helps control the range of motion. Exaggerating certain angles shows corners and depth more convincingly. Balancing dynamic gesture with structural elements like boxes is crucial.</p>

<h2>Practical Tips and Visual Aids</h2>

<h3>Initial Stages and Light Lines</h3>

<p>Focus on the big picture before committing to final lines. Use light initial lines to allow for corrections with darker lines later. Learning to draw with a lighter hand can help in making corrections.</p>

<h3>Visualizing and Drawing Complex Shapes</h3>

<p>Using physical models like Play-Doh or kneaded erasers can help. Visual aids assist in transitioning to more accurate and confident drawings.</p>

<h3>Maintaining Perspective and Proportions</h3>

<p>Drawings can be very three-dimensional and distorted but still maintain perspective. Proportions should reflect the actual dimensions of the subject. Avoid wobbly lines and ensure strong corners to enhance the illusion of perspective.</p>
