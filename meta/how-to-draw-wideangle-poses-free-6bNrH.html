<h2>What's in Premium?</h2>

<p>In the full lesson, you'll see how I move the camera around a figure to explore dramatic foreshortening and wide-angle effects. I’ll show you how to use scale change and overlap to make forms pop, and how to adjust each shape to keep anatomy believable. We’ll discuss top-down and up-shot angles, experimenting with thumbnails to find the sweet spot between realism and expression. You’ll also see how I blend technical perspective with a looser, more spontaneous drawing style that brings energy to each figure.</p>
