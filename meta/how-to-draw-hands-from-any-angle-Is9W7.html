<h2>Observing Asymmetry and Gesture</h2>

<p>I like to look at hands from different angles. I often notice that each gesture has an <strong>asymmetrical</strong> flow. Sometimes it’s a <strong>curve, a curve</strong>, or an <strong>S-curve</strong>. I prefer an S-curve because those subtle transitions show how the <strong>wrist</strong> meets the <strong>articulating hand</strong>. The thumb typically sits at an <strong>oblique angle</strong>, which adds a nice contrast to fingers that may be aligned vertically.</p>

<p>When drawing, I watch how the knuckles might widen and how the wrist stays slender. I try not to exaggerate that disproportion. If the wrist is too thin compared to the knuckles, it can distort the overall structure. I like to keep it <strong>more parallel</strong> before building out the hand shape.</p>

<h2>Establishing the Hand’s Core Shapes</h2>

<p>I often start with a <strong>simple form</strong> for the back of the hand. If the hand is going away from me, I imagine it as a <strong>layered construction</strong> with a <strong>half-and-half split</strong>: part that is closer, part that recedes. Then I can add the fingers one by one. I <strong>minimize</strong> how far the side of the hand juts out at first and only add more if needed.</p>

<p>When the little finger is pressed against a surface, such as a shoulder, it might <strong>flatten</strong>. Sometimes the thumb also <strong>expands</strong>. I’ll mark out these overlaps and expansions later in my drawing. If I see a <strong>slight curve</strong> across the fingers, I emphasize it to keep the shape <strong>attractive and graceful</strong>.</p>

<h2>Finger Placement and Foreshortening</h2>

<p>When the <strong>fingers are foreshortened</strong>, I remember that they should look <strong>shorter than expected</strong>. I divide them into halves or quarters if needed. It helps me keep them from becoming too long. Once I place the joints, I can always make small adjustments by bending or flattening them to correct their length.</p>

<p>With perspective, some fingers might be at a <strong>flatter angle</strong> (appearing longer), while others recede more dramatically (appearing shorter). I sometimes prefer to start with a rigid, tube-like shape for each finger and then refine the gesture after. This avoids “spaghetti fingers.”</p>

<h2>Boxy vs. Curved Structures</h2>

<p>When I see a hand that looks like a <strong>two-by-four</strong> or <strong>two-by-six</strong>, I might draw it as a <strong>box</strong> with one corner <strong>chiseled</strong> away. If the knuckles are aligned in a curve, I’ll <strong>round</strong> the top edge. Sometimes I’ll leave it boxy on the underside and more curved on top. Renaissance artists often portrayed a <strong>cupping action</strong> on hands, which gives a graceful feel.</p>

<p>If I need to be more precise, I observe how each finger angles back in perspective. The <strong>middle finger</strong> is often the longest, but it might look shorter if it’s foreshortened. I measure each subsequent finger by comparing it to the one I just drew. I also <strong>curve or loop</strong> any webbing between fingers to anchor their spacing.</p>

<h2>Palm Side and Wrist Connection</h2>

<p>On the <strong>palm side</strong>, I often imagine another <strong>box-like</strong> shape, but I <strong>bulge</strong> it slightly to resemble the natural curve of the palm. Where the wrist attaches, I might see a clear <strong>corner</strong> in the form, or it could be flatter. I check the <strong>foreshortening</strong> at the wrist, visibility can make it appear <strong>shorter</strong> or <strong>longer</strong> than I first expect.</p>

<p>When adding the <strong>thumb</strong>, I look at how it lines up with the rest of the palm. Sometimes I cut off the top corner of the thumb or finger shape with a <strong>flatter line</strong> to indicate the nail plane. This helps orient the finger and nail correctly.</p>

<h2>Incorporating the Ulna</h2>

<p>When examining the <strong>forearm to hand connection</strong>, I remember the <strong>ulna</strong> is on the <strong>little-finger side</strong>. I like the mnemonic: little finger has an L, ulna has an L. The ulna has a <strong>prominent head</strong> near the wrist, and the hand often articulates on that side. It provides a good <strong>landmark</strong> but doesn’t usually drive my gesture since it’s often a straighter line. Still, including that influence in my construction can add realism to the wrist and forearm area.</p>

<p>I usually start with the <strong>sweeping gesture</strong> of the forearm, then look for that <strong>straight</strong> ulna to lock in structure. Even if it’s subtle in the final drawing, visualizing it helps me place the rest of the forms more confidently.</p>

<p>That’s how I approach these hand poses when focusing on gesture, proportion, perspective, and structure. By paying attention to curves and angles, I keep the hands looking coordinated and expressive.</p>
