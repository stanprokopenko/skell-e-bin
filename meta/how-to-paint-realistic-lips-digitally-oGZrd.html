<h2>Starting the Final Lip Painting</h2>

<p>I'm excited to start our final painting for the lips chapter. I'll begin with a light gesture and lay-in, using that ovoid shape for the <strong>denture sphere</strong>.</p>

<h2>Sketching the Lips</h2>

<p>I lightly rough in the <strong>lip line</strong>, focusing on the tilt. I make sure I'm in the ballpark before fleshing out the rest of the lips. Then I find the <strong>center line</strong> and establish the <strong>cupid's bow</strong>.</p>

<p>My wife posed for this painting. These are her lips. They look a little snarly because she was losing patience with me trying to get the right lighting and angle. I definitely appreciate her doing it.</p>

<h2>Defining Key Features</h2>

<p>I establish the <strong>lower lip</strong> shape and indicate the light receding plane under it, which feeds into the top of the chin. I block out the <strong>philtrum</strong> above the upper lip, showing how it feeds into the <strong>septum of the nose</strong>. I also sketch the <strong>nostrils</strong>, ensuring all facial features line up parallel to each other for symmetry.</p>

<p>I lightly indicate the <strong>nasal labial fold</strong> and draw a light circle for the chin. Then I punch in the <strong>dark accents</strong> at the corners of the mouth.</p>

<p>I've kept all the line work very light and soft. Now I can do a second pass with a darker line and more confidence. I add the pockets of occlusion flanking the center tubercle and the <strong>lower tubercles</strong>. I also indicate the <strong>donut shape</strong> around the corners of the mouth.</p>

<p>I ensure the lateral right side of the lip aligns vertically with the side of the chin. I softly work in the nasal labial fold on the right side and frame our sketch. I think we're about ready to start adding color.</p>

<h2>Preparing for Color</h2>

<p>I show my layers and flatten everything for the drawing onto one layer, labeling it <strong>line</strong>. I hold down <strong>Alt</strong> and click the eye icon to make sure I don't have any opaque brushstrokes on the line layer.</p>

<h3>Applying a Color Wash</h3>

<p>I create another layer underneath the line layer where I'll do a quick color wash. I prefer using <strong>cad reds and oranges</strong> for that color wash. Maybe a little more orange. This helps eliminate the intimidating white background. If any of the canvas comes through, it will match the flesh tones better and be less eye-catching. I label this layer <strong>wash</strong>.</p>

<h3>Colorizing the Line Layer</h3>

<p>I go back to the line layer to colorize it. In Photoshop, I hold down <strong>Ctrl + U</strong> to pull up the hue saturation sliders. I check the <strong>colorize</strong> box, slide the saturation to the right, and increase the lightness. I adjust it to get a color that feels more like <strong>burnt sienna</strong> or a mix of jet black with cad orange or cad red.</p>

<h2>Adding Local Colors</h2>

<p>I create another layer between the wash and the line, labeled <strong>local colors</strong>. Using my squared textured brush, I find the <strong>local colors</strong>, and fill in the different areas with flat shapes. I'm not worrying about gradients, dark accents, or highlights yet, just flat color at this point.</p>

<h3>Skin</h3>

<p>I select a midtone color for her skin, adjusting the redness and value. My wife is a redhead, so there's a bit more red in her skin. I fill in the skin area with this flat color.</p>

<h3>Lips</h3>

<p>For the lips, I choose a darker, redder color since she has naturally darker red lips. I fill in the lips with this flat color.</p>

<h3>Background</h3>

<p>I add a neutral color for the background, with a bit more yellow to create contrast.</p>

<p>I clean up any excess color exceeding our borders using the lasso selection tool.</p>

<h2>Separating Lights and Darks</h2>

<p>I create another layer labeled <strong>lights and darks</strong>. I'm still focusing on graphic flat shapes, dividing the lights and darks the best I can.</p>

<h3>Shadows</h3>

<p>I select the local skin color and adjust it to find a general color for all the <strong>shadow shapes</strong> in the skin. I fill in these shadow areas with a flat, graphic representation, simplifying the lights and darks. I do the same for the lips, noting that the <strong>upper lip</strong> tends to have more lavender, while the <strong>lower lip</strong> has more red.</p>

<h3>Dark Accents</h3>

<p>I create another layer labeled <strong>dark accents</strong>. When working with flesh tones, I use warmer, dark reds for the darker accents. This lends itself to more vibrant shadows and areas of occlusion without deadening the image. I focus on areas like the corners of the mouth and the occlusions.</p>

<h3>Highlights</h3>

<p>I create another layer labeled <strong>highlights</strong>. I use cooler colors in the pinks for the highlights, keeping them graphic and simplifying complex areas into larger shapes.</p>

<p>I label all my layers appropriately to keep things organized.</p>

<h2>Blending and Refining</h2>

<p>I create a new layer, and I flatten all the layers into one by hitting <strong>Shift + Ctrl + Alt + E</strong>. Now, I start blending using my blender brush. Softening the edges already starts to make the painting feel much more natural. I don't want to get rid of all my hard edges, I want a nice balance between the two.</p>

<h3>Refining the Lips</h3>

<p>I start separating the shapes in the lips, adjusting the values and colors. I soften edges and refine the shapes to make them feel more natural. I use my blender brush to blend some of the shapes so they're not too strong or noisy.</p>

<h3>Adjusting Highlights</h3>

<p>I go back to my highlights layer and adjust the highlights using cooler colors, maybe more magenta or lavender, and desaturate them. I keep my shapes more triangular and try to avoid small highlights that can be distracting.</p>

<h3>Adding Details</h3>

<p>I continue to finesse the painting, pushing and pulling, experimenting with colors and shapes. I increase saturation where needed, and punch in dark accents. I focus on getting a nice variation of shapes, big, medium, small, without making it too busy.</p>

<h2>Finalizing the Painting</h2>

<p>At this point, I've established the main colors, shapes, and anatomy of the lighting. I go in to finesse areas like the nose shape, the chin, and the shadow shapes. This requires a lot of noodling, pushing, and pulling.</p>

<p>For the sake of time, I'll speed up the process and flush out these details. On the other side, we'll do a quick review of what we accomplished in this painting.</p>

<h2>Reviewing the Lip Anatomy</h2>

<p>Let's do a quick review of the anatomy:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Cupid's Bow</strong>: The top center of the upper lip.</li>

<li><strong>Corners of the Mouth</strong>: The dark accents where the upper and lower lips meet.</li>

<li><strong>Middle Tubercle</strong>: The central protrusion on the upper lip.</li>

<li><strong>Flanking Tubercles</strong>: The protrusions on either side of the middle tubercle.</li>

<li><strong>Lower Tubercles</strong>: The two tubercles on the lower lip.</li>

<li><strong>Recessed Plane</strong>: The harder edge at the base of the lip under the lower lip.</li>

<li><strong>Philtrum</strong>: The area above the upper lip that goes into the septum of the nose.</li>

<li><strong>Donut Shape</strong>: The shape around the corners of the mouth.</li>

</ul>

<p>Remember, overall, the mouth is round, and the <strong>lip line</strong> is like a flattened version of the cupid's bow.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p>Thanks so much for watching this chapter and sticking with it to the very end. I hope you learned a lot about the structure of the mouth and how to draw it. I'm excited to move on to the final chapter. I'll see you there.</p>
