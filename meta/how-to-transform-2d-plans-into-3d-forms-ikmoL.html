<p>Your final project for this lesson involves a series of puzzles. You'll start with <strong>one plan</strong>, which tells you how <strong>wide</strong> and <strong>deep</strong> an object is, but it tells you <strong>nothing about its height</strong>. This means you can <strong>make up the heights any way you want</strong>.</p>

<h2>Playing with Heights</h2>

<p>You can manipulate the heights in an <strong>obvious</strong> or <strong>less obvious</strong> way. You can make <strong>positive parts into negative</strong> parts or vice versa. You can <strong>squash and stretch the height</strong> of any portion of the block. This exercise is <strong>good for your brain</strong>, and it's <strong>not that hard</strong> if you use a <strong>template</strong>.</p>

<p>I've made a few templates you can use, and I'll get to that in a moment. You can even make one portion <strong>float above or below</strong> another. Just be sure to <strong>connect them with little wires</strong> to clarify any confusion about where it really is. A <strong>height line</strong> can help you <strong>track height</strong>.</p>

<h2>Drawing Oblique Views and Orthographic Elevations</h2>

<p>You'll have to do this <strong>slowly</strong>. <strong>Every corner counts</strong>, and it takes some thinking about which lines are on the <strong>other side</strong>. But when you know which lines are on the other side, you can <strong>fade them back</strong> to enhance the illusion.</p>

<p>One plan, <strong>various elevations</strong>. And if you want to be sure you're getting this, actually <strong>draw the side and front elevations</strong>. You can do it <strong>before or after</strong> you draw the <strong>oblique views</strong>. If you draw the orthos first, you have to <strong>conform your oblique view</strong> to them. And if you draw the oblique view first, you have to <strong>conform your orthos</strong> to it.</p>

<h2>Why We Do This</h2>

<p>Drawing the other views <strong>stretches your awareness</strong> to the other views. It helps you know the <strong>true proportions</strong>. If you want to exercise the part of your brain that <strong>solves spatial puzzles</strong>, pause these images and look them over until they make <strong>perfect sense to you</strong>.</p>

<p>If you get that, you'll see that we could do this puzzle <strong>another way</strong>. If this were a <strong>side view</strong>, we could play with the <strong>width</strong>. <strong>Same idea, different starting point</strong>. And if this were a <strong>front view</strong>, same thing. We could play with the <strong>depth</strong> since front orthos don't show depth. Just reminding you that a <strong>draft view</strong> is one flat view that needs more to complete it. This is <strong>pure three-dimensional thinking</strong>.</p>

<h2>Practice and Mastery</h2>

<p>If you find it difficult, <strong>try copying these examples</strong>. Eventually, you'll get it. If you already get it, <strong>try some new elevations</strong> based on this plan. If you want to master it, <strong>create your own forms</strong> from these plans. See how many variations you can do. Or go fully independent and <strong>make up your own plans</strong>, but keep them all <strong>right-angled</strong> for now.</p>

<p>Some genius may do some complicated first attempt and keep track of everything and put bevels in there, but we normal folks do better, I think, to <strong>start simply</strong>.</p>

<h2>Using Isometric Graph Paper</h2>

<p>You can even make it simpler. You can use <strong>isometric graph paper</strong>, which has angled lines that take away the problem of <strong>vanishing points</strong>. Every line is exactly <strong>60 degrees</strong>, <strong>90 degrees</strong>, or <strong>120 degrees</strong>, and there's <strong>no convergence</strong>. You have nice light blue traces of every line.</p>

<p>You always know how to put a plan into perspective because <strong>foreshortening is predictable</strong>. You can <strong>count the units</strong>. If it's six units one way and nine the other, you just count them out. If it's a <strong>square plan</strong>, as we've been using, you count out the same number on each axis. And you don't have to land exactly on the blue lines if you choose to work <strong>somewhere between them</strong>.</p>

<p>You can even use <strong>square graph paper</strong> by drawing <strong>to and through corners</strong>. The <strong>45-degree isometric position</strong> looks a bit awkward, but by choosing which corners to intersect, you can create other angles.</p>

<h2>Limitations of Graph Paper and Isometric Perspective</h2>

<p>But graph paper has its limits. <strong>Isometric perspective</strong> doesn't give us the <strong>realism</strong> that we get when we bring in <strong>vanishing points</strong>. And it has one other limitation that's a big deal in this course. Isometrics only create forms in a <strong>few fixed positions</strong>.</p>

<p>But so do these examples I've drawn using vanishing points. That's okay. Until you learn how to place a plan in perspective on your own, you can use these <strong>templates</strong>. They only fix the position as it spins left to right so that you are free to create <strong>flexible heights</strong>.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p>We'll use this thinking in our next lesson. Back to <strong>orthos</strong>. The <strong>three basic views</strong> on the three basic axes are the three basic <strong>one-side-at-a-time truths</strong> of how a thing takes up space. Draw from these plans, or if you're ambitious, <strong>create an ortho</strong> of anything you want to learn to draw from imagination.</p>
