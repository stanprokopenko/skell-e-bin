<p>In this lesson, I'm going to walk you through a variety of poses, ranging from challenging ones to new variations we haven't explored much yet. Last time, we discussed how I provided you with an average or ideal framework to think about and organize your thoughts around <strong>gesture</strong>. The real challenge lies in seeking and adjusting to find all those variations in poses. So let's get started.</p>

<h2>Exploring Different Poses</h2>

<h3>Incorporating Shoulder Tilt</h3>

<p>In some poses, like the forward pinch we just worked on, I like to flip the lines. Here's my weight-bearing leg, and I'll create some wraps. Now that we've talked through the ideas of invention and how we can learn from master copies, feel free to make different choices in any of these poses.</p>

<p>The goal for me is still to <strong>abstract</strong> the figure, reducing what I see to the bare minimum in terms of lines and shapes. This becomes a departure point for ensuring that my aims are fulfilled, or the ideas I want to push with the figure.</p>

<p>Sometimes, I like to include a <strong>tilt for the shoulders</strong>. Shoulders give a lot of expression. I've heard Kevin Chen refer to them as the <strong>"eyebrows of the torso,"</strong> which I think is a beautiful metaphor. The height and tilt of the shoulders add a lot to the pose.</p>

<h3>Adjusting Center of Gravity</h3>

<p>We can double-check elements like the <strong>center of gravity</strong>. Do I want to reconsider where the weight is? Maybe mine is a little further out, but still pretty close. This means the pose will be balanced.</p>

<p>If I wanted to change that, I could move or shift the leg position. Sometimes, I'll play around like this, as a precursor to doing more invention. If I were to shift this leg back, what does that do? Maybe it feels like there's more motion or potential for lean, or we're starting to suggest that <strong>"about to"</strong> quality, where we're not making it a static or finite movement or position.</p>

<h2>Using Part-to-Part Relations and Rhythm</h2>

<p>When working on poses, I often focus on the <strong>part-to-part relationships</strong> and how every curve represents a part of the body. To get the transition from one rhythm to another, I might use a little curve for the knee. That curve stops the motion, redirects it, and gives me a sense of fluid direction down into the foot.</p>

<p>Sometimes, adding elements like the shoulder line can be tricky. It can be hard to keep the movement fluid, as it might abruptly halt the rhythm. So, as long as you can work around it or keep it lighter, it can add to your drawing.</p>

<h3>Adding Relational Rhythms</h3>

<p>I might think about adding more of those <strong>relational rhythms</strong>. What about a big S-curve here? While I don't focus on it as much, the long relational <strong>Loomis line</strong> can add a nice quality of connection, especially for the arms or legs. You might use something like that as the shoulder tilt instead.</p>

<p>As you do your gesture drawings, you're going to come across these little things in your own work. If you see it and you like it, start to work with it.</p>

<h2>Experimenting with Diagonals and Leans</h2>

<p>I really like diagonals in poses, they're fun areas to push. For example, I might have the head and cervical spine, then a stretch in the thoracic spine, and a lean forward in the lumbar. I might yank the pelvis back in direction, creating a dynamic pose.</p>

<p>Where's my weight? Maybe it's shared, but one side feels more prominent. With a bent knee and the foot treated like a <strong>dynamic sock</strong>, I'm keeping my variations as the norm or average and then changing whatever I need to from there.</p>

<h3>Playing with Economy</h3>

<p>Maybe, as the pose is more passive, I could use one line for a leg. That would be a way to start playing with more <strong>economy</strong>. A more truncated curve or line might suggest weight. Something more passive and fluid, even if I bring it all the way from the top, might suggest a more relaxed position or side of the body.</p>

<p>That's also the principles of <strong>contrapposto</strong>. One side of the body might be celebrated for the active anatomy, appearing straighter and tighter in terms of C-curve, while the passive side feels more elongated as the muscles stretch.</p>

<h2>Avoiding Symmetry in Front Views</h2>

<p>Let's address the common front view, the straight-on pose. This is about as straight-on as we get, and I know that for many of you who want to do character work, this is a common view you have to tackle. So, how do we approach this?</p>

<p>Well, I'm breaking out of the idea of average, and almost moving back into my <strong>proportion chart</strong>. This is the main area of difficulty, the torso can get symmetrical or stiff. However, the legs are asymmetrical inherently with the muscles, so you can focus on that.</p>

<h3>Enhancing Asymmetry</h3>

<p>One way to move the eye away from being engaged in too much symmetry is to push it in other areas. Maybe I start to hint at some of the anatomy, how muscle groups participate in that larger asymmetry. For example, I might emphasize the <strong>sartorius</strong> area. Don't worry if anatomy is still on your to-do list, you can look at the legs and see that the contour is the same rhythm I'm using on the inside of the body with these gestures.</p>

<p>Alternatively, remember that your <strong>rib cage leans forward</strong> because of the thoracic spine, and the <strong>pelvis leans back</strong>. Your asymmetry here has to be 3D. The neck is pushing forward because the cervical spine does that. I'm almost always thinking of this design when drawing figures and moving it around in my head.</p>

<h3>Dealing with Arms</h3>

<p>Arms can be approached differently. You could use a C-curve, C-curve, and S-curve to give movement to the arm, or be more precise with the grouping of muscles, showing the deltoid, tricep, bicep, and forearm. Both methods can achieve a similar effect.</p>

<p>This straight-on pose is the hardest to draw because, to me, it's the least interesting. So, how do you make something inherently non-interesting feel fun, dynamic, or fluid? You can extend asymmetry into shifting weight or moving your pose, but that may not always be an option.</p>

<h2>Incorporating Anatomy in Gesture Drawing</h2>

<p>I'm also trying to switch back and forth between male and female figures so that you see that I do not, at this stage, discriminate between body type or gender. It's just the positioning of a body, which allows for easier invention. You're taking a little off your plate in terms of the specific body you're inventing and instead just positioning a <strong>template</strong> for a figure.</p>

<h3>Adding Anatomical Qualities</h3>

<p>Occasionally, when I'm a little looser and becoming less instructional in my drawings, I start to incorporate more <strong>anatomical qualities</strong> into the way I make gestures. For example, a formulaic way I like to appreciate the legs is that they're two curves, and sometimes a third if they're bent. If I put a straight here and still don't make a shape, that starts to represent the difference between the tighter form of the <strong>hamstring</strong> and the fuller form of the <strong>quadricep</strong>.</p>

<p>The inclusion of a <strong>straight</strong> is for bone and hard surfaces, bone or stiff surface, and that's what I've done here.</p>

<h2>Starting with the Head or Not</h2>

<p>You could also try doing different versions of body to head. Some people like to do the head last and consider it an afterthought to the gesture of the body. Play with that and see what happens.</p>

<p>I tend to like putting the head in because it registers for me as a <strong>focal point</strong> quickly, and I get that "start here for the viewer, end at the foot" kind of idea. But I sometimes notice that if I'm not really focused and paying attention, my heads can get a little stiff, so I see the value in doing that.</p>

<h2>Planning Ahead for Further Development</h2>

<p>I'm always planning for what I anticipate ending with. Gestures early on help correct for problems I know I'll have later. On top of this, I'll layer my <strong>construction</strong> and <strong>perspective</strong>, which can stiffen your drawing. By putting all that stuff on top, it's more cerebral and conceptual.</p>

<p>Every progressive step tightens this up a little bit, so that's part of my consideration.</p>

<h2>Abstraction and Design Elements in Gesture</h2>

<p>The goal for me is always letting this dissolve into as much <strong>abstraction</strong> as possible, so I can design with it. I start to see things like basic shapes, <strong>spheres</strong>, <strong>boxes</strong>, <strong>triangles</strong>, <strong>straights</strong>, <strong>C-curves</strong>, <strong>S-curves</strong>. The more I can participate with these elements, the more I'm able to set up some kind of design or see the figure as the mechanics of fundamentals rather than a figure. This can make it stiff and harder to relate to as I build it up.</p>

<h2>Applying Gesture Drawing to Animals</h2>

<p>If I were to draw an animal, I would use this exact same process. For example, here's a horse: cervical, stretch, thoracic. You can use the exact same lines but organized in different lengths and directions to match that separate type of form.</p>

<p>It's just lines organized differently, and in either case, it could become something completely different, a dog, a cat. It's a principle of organization. Because animals also have spines and asymmetry in muscle groups and operate on principles of weight and balance, keeping a pure view of the mechanics of how you're making the drawing extends the possibilities of what you can present.</p>

<p>If your technique is always just about showing the figure, you're limited.</p>

<h2>Repetition of Theme and Design in Gesture</h2>

<p>When looking for shapes and showing the difference in shapes and figures, I like <strong>thematic repetition</strong>. Whenever I can find a shape or a quality of design in a pose, I like to repeat it to build a unifying quality. That extends your gesture into more complex qualities of design.</p>

<h3>Using Straights and Curves</h3>

<p>Again, why am I doing straighter, darker lines? Those are my notational descriptions of where <strong>weight</strong> is more important. I'm still not thinking of those as contours, this is shorthand for what I want to be important.</p>

<p>Here's my gesture for the leg on that side. The knee is just slightly past the foot, and it's done.</p>

<p>By exploring different poses and techniques in gesture drawing, we can push our understanding and create more dynamic, fluid figures. Remember, gesture drawing is a process of abstraction, allowing us to reduce what we see to the bare minimum and use that as a foundation to build upon. Keep experimenting, stay open to new ideas, and most importantly, have fun with your drawings.</p>
