<p>I recently reviewed our submissions for the “Crazy Perspective” lesson and its follow-up videos. We focused on getting these extreme angles into our intuition by exploring radical viewpoints. We also touched on overlapping objects, plan projections, and how to balance exaggeration with readability.</p>

<h2>Daring Overlap</h2>

<p>One recurring theme was <strong>overlapping objects so much that the forward shapes block out what’s behind them</strong>. That extreme overlap can make a drawing feel lively, but it risks confusing viewers. Close objects often appear so large that they obliterate what’s behind them. The challenge is to push that effect without losing clarity.</p>

<p>I saw examples of this with trees drawn at different distances, or a character in three stages: far away, closer, and then so oversized it blocked everything else. Sometimes the drawing became illegible, so we tried to keep the art readable by slightly pulling back on the overlap.</p>

<h2>Balancing Exaggeration and Readability</h2>

<p>It’s easy to overdo an extreme angle. If the front shape is too big, everything else disappears. On the other hand, if you never exaggerate, the image can feel stagnant and uninspired. A <strong>good blend of daring and clarity</strong> is ideal. Think of it like the “pin the tail on the donkey” scenario: if one shape jumps too far forward, we lose the connecting forms behind it.</p>

<h2>Plan Projections and Intuitive Sketching</h2>

<p>We spent time talking about plan projections, where you methodically plot objects in perspective from a top or side view. This is a useful analytical tool, but our goal is also to learn how to do it <strong>intuitively</strong>. When you draw something many times, like a wheel, a hand, or a guitar, from different close-up angles, you naturally begin to sense how perspective works without ruler-based methods.</p>

<h2>Handling Ellipses and Extreme Distortion</h2>

<p><strong>Ellipses can appear heavily warped</strong> when they are close to the viewer in wide-angle drawings. Their front edge may balloon or swell in surprising ways. Even if you want to keep an ellipse “correct,” it might look strange in a dramatic close-up. This distortion can be baffling, but it’s worth studying photographs, especially panoramas, to see how it happens in real life.</p>

<h2>Examples and Observations</h2>

<p>Many students tackled this lesson with creative approaches:</p>

<ul>

<li>Some picked a single figure or object, then drew it in stages, moving closer each time.  </li>

<li>Others tried sequential close-ups and labeled each shift in viewpoint.  </li>

<li>A few approached it with <strong>boxes</strong> only, letting simple forms highlight the warping.  </li>

<li>Some used plan projections to confirm how big the front shapes became.  </li>

</ul>

<p>I especially liked the ones that <strong>showed a warmup or preliminary stage</strong> first, then the final result. That process reveals how they decided on the balance of overlap, scale, and clarity.</p>

<h2>Integrating Opposites</h2>

<p>To keep your “perspective muscles” strong, alternate between <strong>exact, methodical projections</strong> and <strong>free, intuitive sketches</strong>. Just like exercising opposing muscle groups, switching between precise and playful modes keeps your drawings lively while staying grounded in believable space.</p>

<h2>Alternate Assignments</h2>

<p>If you want to explore wide angles further:

1. Pick an environment you enjoy and use a large sheet of paper.<br />

2. Start with what’s directly ahead in the center.<br />

3. Gradually “stretch” your drawing left, right, above, and below, capturing a panorama.<br />

4. Let it wobble. Notice how your view transforms as you fill the edges.  </p>

<p>You may see that what once felt wrong now makes sense for a <strong>wide-angle view</strong>. If you like panoramas, you can also study photographers or illustrators who do composite shots. When you understand the reasons behind these distortions, you’ll see the creative possibilities are huge.</p>

<h2>Closing Thoughts</h2>

<p>This assignment was designed to free us from timid perspective. <strong>Push scale boldly</strong>, observe how objects enlarge up close, and keep them identifiable. It’s a playful approach that invites us to find our own unique wide-angle style. We’ll continue to explore camera effects and how to apply them to our art in the next lessons.</p>

<p>I hope this feedback is helpful. Try these techniques out, then compare your results with your earliest attempts. You’ll see how far you’ve come in handling extreme perspective. Keep going, and I’ll see you in the next session!</p>
