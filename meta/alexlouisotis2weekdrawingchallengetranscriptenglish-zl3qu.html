<h2>Get into the Routine of Drawing Daily</h2>

<p>Challenge yourself to <strong>draw every day</strong>. See if you can get into the routine of drawing daily. <strong>Set aside a time</strong>. Put it in your calendar.</p>

<h2>Increase Your Challenge</h2>

<p>If you're already drawing every day, then do something to <strong>challenge yourself a little more</strong>. Draw a bit longer. But don't go too crazy. <strong>Set a manageable goal</strong> because this is in addition to the other project I'll be giving you later.</p>

<h2>Daily Assignment: Fill Up One Page with Linear Drawings</h2>

<p>Every day, fill up one page with <strong>linear drawings from life</strong>. You can either go outside and draw something when inspiration hits or find something at home and draw it. <strong>Take a photo of your objects</strong>.</p>

<h2>Drawing Tips</h2>

<p>If you can, start by just <strong>looking at your subject for one minute</strong>. Imagine it as a drawing. Draw a few lines. Then look. <strong>Think and execute</strong>. Repeat until you're done.</p>

<p>Each drawing can take <strong>5 to 30 minutes</strong>, but don't time them.</p>

<h2>I'll Be Drawing Along with You</h2>

<p>I'll be drawing along with you guys and posting in the discussions below.</p>

<p>Thank you for watching. I'll see you next time.</p>
