<p>Hello everyone, my name is Bryce Kho. I'm an illustrator and concept artist. Today, I'd like to share with you the sketchbook I filled over the last month.</p>

<h2>Warm-Up Poses with Watercolors</h2>

<p>I began with three-minute warm-up poses using a <strong>Kuretake Gansai Tambi</strong> watercolor palette. These quick sketches allowed me to capture dynamic action by thoughtfully arranging the compositions. Even in such short poses, laying them out effectively can give a sense of motion and sometimes spark ideas for future illustrations.</p>

<h2>Quick Value with Watercolors</h2>

<p>I prefer using watercolors because they let me get value on the page quickly. Instead of slowly rendering with pencil, I load up my brush heavily with water and ink to create bigger gestural marks. When the brush is most loaded, I paint the darkest areas. As the water dilutes the ink, I make broader strokes and, with the remaining softer values, go back in to add details.</p>

<h2>Revisiting Sketches and Adding Backgrounds</h2>

<p>Sometimes I revisit a page and add a background behind the character. This technique allows me to reshape and fix things with the outer contour. For example, adding an edge to a hat can look like a highlight and make the drawing appear intentional. It's a fun way to <strong>polish drawings</strong> and learn how form and highlights can change an image.</p>

<h2>Bridging Loose Drawings and Finished Illustrations</h2>

<p>There's often a big disconnect between really loose drawings and finished illustrations. I've always considered them two separate skill sets. By going back and trying to polish up these drawings, I have gained a better understanding of the core of my sketches. Taking something I initially didn't like and transforming it into something I'm at least okay with means that nothing is truly lost. It's not wasted time, you can learn more from it than just the initial practice.</p>

<h2>My Tools and Materials</h2>

<p>I've been using a <strong>travel watercolor set</strong> for this entire sketchbook. It came with a watercolor brush pen, which has a tube of water. When you squeeze it, a little water comes out, allowing you to use the hard watercolors to get value on the page quickly. Sometimes, to switch things up, I use a <strong>Kuretake Bimoji pen</strong>. Many of my illustrations are done with inks, and these kinds of drawings have taught me a lot about color.</p>

<h2>Playing with Colors and Techniques</h2>

<p>My palette is intentionally messy. When I'm drawing, I often load three different colors on my brush. It's really fun because as you work, the last color you loaded appears first, then gradually transitions to the mixed colors from before. You naturally get gradients and pops of color that you might not expect. Those unexpected combinations teach me what I like and encourage me to try new color combinations.</p>

<h2>Exploring at the Natural History Museum</h2>

<p>We took my son to the Natural History Museum in Los Angeles, and I continued using the same palette there. I felt like this particular sketch turned out well. I used two colors I wouldn't normally think would make an aesthetic drawing, but I decided to <strong>go for it</strong> and see if I could make it work. Once you develop a routine, it can become a plateau if you don't reach beyond it. Intentionally trying things you don't think would work and attempting to make them work, that's exciting to me.</p>

<h2>Figure Drawing as a Safe Space</h2>

<p>I always advocate figure drawing as a safe space to <strong>play and learn</strong>, focusing on developing new ideas or sharpening fundamentals. In one session, my favorite drawing was a minimal face. People often ask me how I decide where to leave white space. I'm trying to get the drawing done as quickly as possible and focus on the interesting parts, which means skipping everything I feel I can skip. Leaving space open and implying forms can be fun and add mystery to the drawing.</p>

<h2>Composing Scenes from Poses</h2>

<p>In another session with the same model, I had a new idea: what if I used her poses to compose them on the page and make a scene? As I was drawing, I thought about how to connect these poses to create a story. I made her the focal point, with the other characters looking at her, implying some sort of exchange happening. By adding backgrounds and modifying their attire, I gave each character a different identity. This was really exciting for me.</p>

<h2>Capturing Volumes and Forms</h2>

<p>When I train myself with figure drawing, I focus on the <strong>volumetric</strong> aspects of the model. This means breaking down what I'm seeing into shapes I understand. For example, using a cross-contour line along the thigh reveals the cylindrical shape there. Understanding it as a simple cylinder makes that shape less intimidating and clearer for me to draw. Bringing that understanding to everything I draw helps me reveal underlying shapes as simply and quickly as possible.</p>

<h2>Pushing Style and Experimenting</h2>

<p>Figure drawing is also a place to <strong>push style</strong> because you have the freedom to simplify things due to time constraints. In one drawing, I leaned more into an anime or comic influence, compared to trying to capture likeness. It's about capturing the essence of the pose and adding character. In another pose, the model was doing something ambitious, and I wanted to match her energy. I imagined what she was thinking and filled in the blanks, adding my own elements to the drawing.</p>

<h2>Learning from Live Models</h2>

<p>There's something invaluable about drawing from live models. You get to see angles and details you don't get from photos. For example, capturing the underarm from a specific angle or the way muscles move in certain poses. Having a live person in front of you allows you to pick up extra information that fuels your understanding and can inspire future illustrations.</p>

<h2>Embracing New Subjects and Challenges</h2>

<p>Sometimes, I'll challenge myself to draw unfamiliar subjects, like animals or complex poses. The anatomy of animals can be confusing, and mastering it is still beyond me. I just want to add it to my long-term visual library so I can draw it on the fly someday. It takes a lot of <strong>trial and error</strong>, but I know through experience that I'll eventually get it.</p>

<h2>Overcoming Frustrations and Trying New Things</h2>

<p>There are times when I start a drawing thinking I won't enjoy it, but I'm surprised by how much I like it once I get into it. For example, I once drew a pose I initially thought would be boring, but the amount of personality that came through surprised me. It reminds me to always give things a fair shot and tackle subjects I might initially avoid. If I'm ever stuck in a rut and feeling frustrated, I'll do something else. Switching to a different subject or technique can <strong>refresh my creativity</strong>.</p>

<h2>Balancing Time and Detail</h2>

<p>In longer poses, like 10 or 15 minutes, I might feel more precious about the drawing. Sometimes, I spend too much time on details and lose the opportunity to add in the things I'm interested in. It's a balancing act that happens to me all the time. I'm always trying to find a rhythm, whether it's capturing the whole room in one sketch or focusing on a single pose.</p>

<h2>Filling Sketchbook Pages and Composition</h2>

<p>When composing sketchbook pages, sometimes I leave space intentionally for a pose that might fit. Other times, I might misjudge and end up with blank areas. I also have a habit of leaving the first few pages of a sketchbook blank. It makes me feel like the sketchbook isn't ruined if the first page is bad. It's a mental trick that helps me dive into new projects without fear.</p>

<h2>Exploring New Territory in Illustrations</h2>

<p>In some longer poses, I felt the pose evoked the work of an artist I admire, Soey Milk, who uses soft color palettes and variations in skin tone. I did the drawing quickly in terms of contours and lines, giving myself time to play with values within the forms. It was fun because I don't normally do that. This is me exploring territory I'm unfamiliar with. I just want to learn something new, and trying all the new stuff is how I feel like I'm grinding to level up my overall ability.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p>Overall, filling out this sketchbook and trying to make every page about something new was super informative. My approach is very informed by Kim Jung Gi. The idea of volumes being the key to having the freedom to <strong>draw from imagination</strong> is most intriguing to me. My goal is to draw from imagination, not just from figures. Once you understand a volume, drawing something like a shadow for a cup or a cylinder seems simple, even though it looks impressive when combined with other ideas.</p>

<p>Thanks for joining me on this journey through my sketchbook. I learned a lot, and I hope sharing my process has been helpful.</p>
