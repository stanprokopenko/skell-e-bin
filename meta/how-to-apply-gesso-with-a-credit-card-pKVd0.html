<p>When it comes to painting, using the right canvas board is crucial. Here's a guide on how to select and prepare canvas boards for your artwork.</p>

<h2>Selecting Canvas Boards</h2>

<p>You can purchase canvas boards from stores like Hobby Lobby, Michaels, Joann's Fabrics, or Dick Blick. It's essential to ensure that the canvas boards are <strong>acrylic primed</strong>. If the packaging doesn't specify, you can often tell by the smell: oil-primed canvases have an oil smell, while acrylic ones smell like plastic. I prefer to order acrylic primed canvas boards from Dick Blick because they are affordable and come in packs.</p>

<h2>Preparing the Canvas Surface</h2>

<p>Acrylic primed canvas boards are a good painting surface, especially after applying gesso. The texture of these boards is often too rough for portraits, so I use black professional white gesso to smooth it out.</p>

<h3>Applying Gesso</h3>

<p>For applying gesso, I use an old expired credit card or a similar flexible tool instead of a brush. Brushes can conform too much to the canvas texture, while a card helps smooth it out. I save used gift cards for this purpose, as they work well for spreading gesso. Over time, gesso thickens as it dries out, reaching an ideal consistency for application. </p>

<p>For larger strokes, I use a wider scraper from Home Depot, starting from the outside edge to avoid lines. It's important to create an irregular pattern of strokes to prevent visible ridges. Let the gesso dry overnight before applying any acrylic washes to avoid reactivating it.</p>

<h2>Toning the Canvas</h2>

<p>Once the gesso is dry, I apply a gray mid-tone acrylic wash to tone the canvas. Using acrylic paint for the wash is faster and avoids the drying time of oil paint. I recommend using a medium gray acrylic paint for easy color judgment when mixing on the palette. The goal is to simplify the process and avoid unnecessary obstacles. I apply the acrylic wash directly from the tube and use a spray bottle to help spread it evenly. While I focus on a neutral gray tone, other shades can be used if desired.</p>

<h2>Simplifying the Process</h2>

<p>The key to preparing canvas boards is to <strong>simplify and avoid unnecessary obstacles</strong>. Use practical tools and techniques for efficiency. By following these steps, you can ensure your canvas is ready for painting, allowing you to focus on your art.</p>
