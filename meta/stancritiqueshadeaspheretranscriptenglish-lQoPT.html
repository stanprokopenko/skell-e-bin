<p>Shading spheres is a fundamental skill for building strong drawing foundations. Here, I’m going to break down the most common mistakes I see when students shade spheres, especially focusing on value organization, transitions, and believable light. Whether you had unlimited time or were working on 25-minute, 10-minute, or even 5-minute studies, many of these issues are recurring. I want to group the critiques together so you can get as much value from this breakdown as possible. Let’s get into it.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p><strong>Overall Progress and Approach</strong></p>

<p>You all did a fantastic job! I can really see everyone making solid progress. But there are three to five big mistakes pretty much everyone is making at some point, so I’m going to tackle each, explain what’s going wrong, why it happens, and how you can fix it.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p><strong>Incorrect Placement of the Terminator</strong></p>

<p>The terminator is that boundary line where the surface turns away from the light and enters shadow. Placing this line correctly defines the form and lighting more than anything else.</p>

<p>A common mistake I see is putting the terminator too far onto the light side, which flattens the sphere and breaks the illusion of three-dimensionality. </p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Incorrect Terminator</strong> Instead of wrapping around the true equator of the sphere, your line might look like just a small slice off the top or run off the side. Sometimes, it’s not even an ellipse, it flattens or changes direction.</li>

<li><strong>How It Should Be:</strong> When the light source is far away (like the reference I gave, where the sphere is two inches and the lamp is five feet away), the light rays are almost parallel. This means the terminator runs right across the equator of the sphere.</li>

<li><strong>Diagram Principle:</strong> The distance from terminator to the top of the sphere should match the distance from terminator to the bottom That’s your equator, symmetrical across the ball.</li>

<li><strong>Core Shadow Placement:</strong> The core shadow sits entirely on the shadow side, never overlapping the light.</li>

<li><strong>Light Source Distance:</strong> Only if your light is extremely close should the terminator shift far off the equator. If you do that, you’re indicating a very close light source, so be aware of what you’re suggesting.</li>

</ul>

<p>Remember, unless you know your lamp is close, keep that terminator running across the center. It’s not a random slice, visualize where the real equator runs and match it with your shading.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p><strong>Understanding the Core Shadow and Reflected Light</strong></p>

<p>The core shadow is always fully on the shadow side, never creeping into the light. Stack your reflected light in the right spot, and give it the right value.</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Reflected Light Too Bright:</strong> Sometimes I see the reflected light, the glow that bounces back onto the sphere from the ground, being just as light as your halftones on the lit side. This ruins the form and can make the object look metallic or even physically impossible.</li>

<li><strong>Why That’s Off:</strong> On a real object, especially a matte surface, the reflected light is never as bright as anything in the light family. If it is, you’re squashing your value range, making the sphere look flat or unnatural.</li>

<li><strong>What to Do:</strong> Make sure you reserve enough of your value range for the shadow family. Go darker with the core shadow and the cast shadow. Only allow reflected light to get as light as the <em>darkest</em> halftones in the light side, never lighter.</li>

</ul>

<p>Go back to the basics if you’re struggling, review cast shadow, core shadow, halftones, and occlusion to keep those value zones organized.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p><strong>Gradation and the Cosine Law in Value Transitions</strong></p>

<p>Another mistake is how the shadow area transitions into the light.</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Too Linear a Transition:</strong> Some of you make the shift from core shadow to light very slow and even, almost like a soft gradient. On a real sphere (as explained by Lambert’s cosine law), most of the value shift happens quickly, right at the edge of the core shadow.</li>

<li><strong>The Right Transition:</strong> The initial step out of shadow should be a strong jump in value, then as surfaces curve toward the light, the change slows down. Most of the surface in the light is pretty close in value, except near the terminator.</li>

<li><strong>Opposite Problem:</strong> A few people do the opposite, the transition is way too fast, like there’s a sharp edge (almost like a box or with a crease), so the ball loses its roundness.</li>

<li><strong>Balance is Key:</strong> Find that sweet spot by referencing good sphere examples. The best gradation gives you a snug, three-dimensional transition with no abrupt corners or overly soft fades.</li>

</ul>

<p>If needed, look at strong examples side by side, you’ll see how quick-but-not-harsh the change should be.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p><strong>Cast Shadow Shape Mistakes</strong></p>

<p>The cast shadow that your sphere throws onto the ground should be an ellipse if the surface beneath is flat.</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Common Errors:</strong> <ul>

<li>Teardrop-shaped shadows (thick at one end, pinched at the other)</li>

<li>Overly straight “pills” (flat lines with rounded ends)</li>

<li>Off-ellipse forms that don’t align to the sphere</li>

</ul>

</li>

<li><strong>What’s Correct:</strong> The shape of the shadow is always a smooth, symmetrical ellipse on a flat plane. If you’re rushing or not paying attention, it’s easy to get this wrong.</li>

<li><strong>When It Varies:</strong> Only if the cast shadow falls on a curved surface, like an arm, a banana, or a leg, will the shadow curve and distort. Then you have some license to match the curve of that object.</li>

<li><strong>Fix:</strong> Before shading, double-check your ellipse. Is it smooth, does it echo the sphere, does it start curving in before hitting the edge? Don’t flatten or pinch the ends.</li>

</ul>

<p>If you can make a perfect ellipse for the cast shadow, you’ve cleared a big hurdle.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p><strong>Spotty or Patchy Halftones</strong></p>

<p>You want your halftone values to follow the logic of light, not just get placed wherever your pencil lands.</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>The Problem:</strong> I see patches of light and dark, in other words, random or misplaced values, often near the highlight or in the middle area. Sometimes, one side will suddenly get a dark spot with no logic, or there will be “steps” instead of a gentle transition.</li>

<li><strong>Acceptable “Noise”:</strong> Your drawing doesn’t have to be pristine, there’s room for a little texture or “noise,” as long as, overall, the areas average out to the <em>correct</em> value. If not, the ball will look dirty or spotty, and it will not look volumetric.</li>

<li><strong>How to Fix:</strong> Watch for dark patches creeping into your center light, or light bands breaking up the flow of your shadow. Keep transitions smooth, and ensure any roughness is subtle, not in big swatches.</li>

<li><strong>Volume over Sloppiness:</strong> Even if the edges are a bit messy, as long as you keep the zones of value in the right place, the illusion of roundness holds up.</li>

</ul>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p><strong>Additional Observations and Encouragement</strong></p>

<p>There are some really clean, strong spheres in the batch. Sometimes, even when your marks are energetic or loose, the form comes through clear thanks to good value control and design. Some approaches, like rougher pen and ink, introduce a lot of texture, but where you kept the value transitions correct, it still works beautifully.</p>

<p>Remember that in fast studies (five or ten minutes), you may not get every transition perfect, and that’s okay. The priority is understanding, not always perfection.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p><strong>The Importance of Foundations and Deliberate Practice</strong></p>

<p>You need to identify which of these mistakes you’re making, and practice until they’re gone. That’s how you get better, by deliberate correction as you work.</p>

<p>Learning to organize the primitives (spheres, cylinders, boxes) gives you the toolkit to build anything, egg forms, Loomis heads, bones, muscles, whatever you tackle next. The basics repeat, proper shading makes everything you build feel solid and believable, and understanding light is the foundation for creating and designing better, more expressive forms.</p>

<p>Once you make the science of value and light second nature, you stop stressing about it and can focus on what matters: design, storytelling, and creative decisions.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p><strong>In Summary: What to Watch For</strong></p>

<p><strong>The big five mistakes:</strong></p>

<ul>

<li>Terminator in the wrong spot (not following the equator when it should)</li>

<li>Reflected light or shadow values out of balance (not enough range)</li>

<li>Value transitions too linear or too abrupt (cosine law not followed)</li>

<li>Incorrect cast shadow shapes (not proper ellipses on flat surfaces)</li>

<li>Spotty, patchy, or misplaced halftones (messy or dirty looking form)</li>

</ul>

<p>Go back, compare your own work, and pinpoint which of these you need to improve. Correct them, and you’ll see progress quickly.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p><strong>Keep Practicing and Moving Forward</strong></p>

<p>Give yourself credit for your progress and effort! Keep working your shading skills, keep identifying and fixing your most common mistakes, and you’ll keep getting better every week. Looking forward to working on the next set with you all. Let’s keep shading and growing!</p>
