<p>If you're like me, you've probably avoided thinking about WordPress for a while. I used to work with WordPress, but I moved away from it because of various frustrations. Even so, over <strong>40% of the web is still running on WordPress</strong>. Recently, there's been some drama involving two letters: <strong>WP</strong>. I wanted to dive into this situation and share what's been happening.</p>

<h2>Background: WordPress and WP Engine</h2>

<p>First, some context. <strong>WP Engine</strong> is one of many hosting services for WordPress sites. They host WordPress for you, which means they use WordPress but also compete in some ways with <strong>Automattic</strong>, the company behind WordPress. Automattic runs both <strong>wordpress.org</strong>, which offers the open-source software, and <strong>wordpress.com</strong>, which provides hosting services.</p>

<p>Recently, <strong>Matt Mullenweg</strong>, the founder of Automattic and WordPress, has raised concerns about WP Engine's use of "WP" in their name. He believes it causes confusion, with some users thinking WP Engine is officially associated with WordPress.</p>

<h2>Matt Mullenweg's Criticisms</h2>

<h3>Disabling Post Revisions</h3>

<p>One of Matt's main criticisms is that <strong>WP Engine disables post revisions by default</strong> on their hosted WordPress sites. In WordPress, revisions allow you to track and restore previous versions of your content. Matt argues that disabling revisions breaks a core promise of WordPress to protect users' content.</p>

<p>WP Engine states that they disable revisions to improve site performance and reduce storage costs. They also mention that users can contact support to enable revisions if needed.</p>

<h3>Lack of Contributions</h3>

<p>Matt also points out that WP Engine, despite making significant revenue (around <strong>$400 million annually</strong>), contributes very little to WordPress's development. He compares WP Engine's contribution of about <strong>47 hours per week</strong> to Automattic's contribution of over <strong>3,700 hours per week</strong>.</p>

<p>He believes that companies profiting from WordPress should contribute back, following the <strong>"Five for the Future"</strong> initiative, which encourages organizations to contribute 5% of their resources to WordPress development.</p>

<h2>The Legal Escalation</h2>

<p>The situation escalated when <strong>WP Engine sent a cease and desist letter</strong> to Matt and Automattic. They accused him of making threatening statements and causing harm to their business.</p>

<p>In response, Automattic sent their own cease and desist letter, alleging that WP Engine was violating WordPress trademarks by using "WP" in their name and branding. They demanded that WP Engine stop using the trademarks without authorization.</p>

<p>However, it was noted that Automattic had previously stated that <strong>"WP" was not covered by their trademarks</strong>, leading to questions about the validity of their claims.</p>

<h2>Community Reactions</h2>

<p>The WordPress community has had mixed reactions. Many feel that Matt's actions are too aggressive and could harm the ecosystem. There are concerns that attacking WP Engine could set a negative precedent and damage relationships within the community.</p>

<p>Some point out that disabling revisions might not be as significant as Matt suggests, and that performance improvements could justify the decision. Others believe that expecting companies to contribute large amounts of time and resources to WordPress is unreasonable.</p>

<h2>My Thoughts on the Situation</h2>

<p>I think the way Matt has handled this situation is concerning. While it's important to protect user interests and maintain the integrity of WordPress, attacking another company in this manner seems counterproductive.</p>

<p>I understand the desire for companies that profit from WordPress to contribute back. However, the comparison between Automattic's contributions and WP Engine's seems unfair, given that Automattic controls the project.</p>

<p>Furthermore, using legal threats and public attacks doesn't foster a healthy community. It appears that Matt is shifting his arguments and using different tactics to hurt WP Engine, rather than addressing the issues constructively.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p>This conflict between WordPress and WP Engine highlights tensions within the open-source community. It's crucial for leaders to act responsibly and promote collaboration rather than division.</p>

<p>As someone who's observed this unfold, I hope that both parties can find a resolution that benefits the users and the WordPress ecosystem. Open-source thrives when we work together, not when we tear each other down.</p>
