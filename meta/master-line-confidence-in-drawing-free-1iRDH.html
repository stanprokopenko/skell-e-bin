<h2>What's in Premium?</h2>

<p>In the premium lesson, we focus on developing <strong>line confidence</strong> and <strong>control</strong> in your drawing. You'll learn how selecting the right tools, like <strong>felt-tip pens</strong>, can enhance your sensitivity and improve your strokes. We emphasize the importance of physical awareness—your <strong>posture</strong>, <strong>grip</strong>, and <strong>movements</strong>—to prevent strain and improve technique.</p>

<p>The lesson provides specific <strong>line exercises</strong> to build muscle memory and train your eye-hand coordination. You'll practice drawing various lines—<strong>horizontal</strong>, <strong>arc</strong>, <strong>wave</strong>, <strong>stop</strong>, and <strong>pull lines</strong>—to master spacing, proportion, and expression in your drawings.</p>

<p>By incorporating these exercises into your daily routine, you'll develop natural, confident strokes, allowing you to focus more on creativity. Consistent practice leads to significant improvement, making these foundational exercises essential for any aspiring artist.</p>
