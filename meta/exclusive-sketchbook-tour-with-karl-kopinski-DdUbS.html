<p>I recently had the pleasure of welcoming Karl Kopinski into the studio for a sketchbook tour. He shared some of his latest artwork and insights into his creative process, and I wanted to share the highlights with you.</p>

<h2>Exploring New Mediums</h2>

<p>Karl works on about <strong>five or six sketchbooks a year</strong>. Lately, he's been experimenting with <strong>Prismacolor pencils</strong>. Inspired by Claire Wendling, he enjoys using colored pencils because they <strong>don't smudge as much</strong>, which is especially helpful since he's left-handed.</p>

<h2>Quick Sketches and Character Studies</h2>

<p>When a drawing isn't going as planned, Karl fills the page with <strong>smaller studies</strong>. He finds these pages some of the most interesting because they allow him to <strong>explore ideas quickly</strong> and experiment with heavier tones.</p>

<p>He often draws inspiration from stories like <strong>"Journey to the West"</strong>, creating studies of characters like the Monkey King and water demons. Karl also enjoys drawing <strong>mecha</strong>, influenced by Japanese styles, where he uses <strong>quick, loose lines</strong> to explore armor shapes and silhouettes.</p>

<h2>Drawing Techniques</h2>

<p>Karl sometimes draws <strong>without any underdrawing</strong>, going straight in with pen or pencil crayon. This approach helps him make spontaneous decisions and keeps his work dynamic. He also teaches how to <strong>break down complex subjects into simple composite elements</strong>, focusing on lighting, anatomy, and constructing heads.</p>

<h2>Challenges and Practice</h2>

<p>He admits he doesn't draw women enough and sometimes they appear <strong>too masculine</strong>. Karl has been practicing to capture more feminine features without relying on exaggerated traits.</p>

<p>Drawing <strong>helmets without reference</strong> is another challenge he enjoys. German and US helmets have <strong>subtle lines</strong> that require careful attention to get right.</p>

<h2>Studying Faces and People</h2>

<p>Observing people is crucial for Karl. He notes how the <strong>placement of facial features</strong> is more important than the fine details. Recognizing someone from a distance relies on the overall structure rather than eye color or other specifics.</p>

<p>Traveling has taught him about the <strong>subtle differences in bone structure</strong> from country to country. This awareness adds depth to his character designs.</p>

<h2>Personal Projects and Inspirations</h2>

<p>Karl draws inspiration from various sources:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Military History</strong>: His childhood interest in military subjects still influences his work.</li>

<li><strong>Astronauts</strong>: He enjoys drawing astronauts without a specific reason, sometimes just because he likes them.</li>

<li><strong>Pop Culture</strong>: Characters like Batman appear in his sketches, often reimagined in different settings like World War uniforms.</li>

<li><strong>Humorous Pieces</strong>: Zombie mariachis inspired by eating Mexican food in Spain, or goats with hipster jackets drawn after visiting a farm with his kids.</li>

</ul>

<h2>The Big Kopinski Art Book</h2>

<p>Karl introduced his new art book, <strong>The Big Kopinski</strong>, which features a collection of his sketches and paintings. The hardcover book includes personal pieces, commissions, and previously unpublished work. It's a beautiful compilation that showcases the <strong>variety of subject matter</strong> he explores, from dragons and samurai to pirates and Vikings.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p>It was inspiring to see Karl's sketchbooks and hear about his process. His willingness to experiment and his passion for drawing are truly motivating. I hope you found these insights as valuable as I did. Let me know if there are other artists you'd like me to bring into the studio for more demos and sketchbook tours!</p>
