<p>I'm excited to dive into the final stages of painting, where we add those fun elements and really get into discussing color. This is where the magic happens, focusing on <strong>color variations</strong> to achieve realistic flesh tones. </p>

<h2>Learning from Norman Rockwell</h2>

<p>Studying Norman Rockwell's original paintings taught me a lot about the importance of color variations. Rockwell's flesh tones were realistic because of a <strong>mosaic of vibrating colors</strong>, not just the rendering and drawing. When I observe my own hand, I see a variety of colors like purples, grays, and reds in small areas of skin. Faces have similar color variations, with noses getting redder and other areas showing different hues.</p>

<h2>Effects of Light on Color</h2>

<p>The color of light affects highlights, which might appear cooler, adding to the complexity of flesh tones. Good flesh tones require multiple colors, not just one. It's important to establish an average before adding variations. This helps maintain control and prevents the painting from becoming chaotic with too many colors.</p>

<h2>Establishing a Base Color</h2>

<p>Having a <strong>base color</strong> is crucial. It helps in achieving a realistic look and prevents the face from looking unrealistic with too many colors. Experience will improve your understanding of good flesh tones. Establishing a base color helps maintain control and realism.</p>

<h2>Painting Techniques</h2>

<p>I'm meticulous about getting the drawing right, often going back to tighten it up. I use a dark halftone to establish shadows and keep the painting clean with one-stroke techniques. I frequently switch brushes to suit different tasks, especially towards the end of the painting process. I reestablish areas using the average color without dipping into the medium, using thicker paint directly from the tube. Sometimes, I use my finger to smooth transitions between values, ensuring they aren't too stark.</p>

<h2>Refining Values and Transitions</h2>

<p>Constantly refining values and adding gray variations helps in turning forms and telling the story of the form. Adding gray to certain areas reflects the environment and enhances the realism of the painting. I mix black with the average color to create a gray that matches the existing value, adding it to areas facing a gray wall. The eye socket and side of the nose also benefit from gray tones, enhancing the depth and realism. I use gray at the beginning of a mustache or beard to create a five o'clock shadow effect.</p>

<h2>Enhancing Realism with Color</h2>

<p>Adding red warmth to the nose reflects the natural blood flow and aging process, making it appear more realistic. I adjust the shape of the nose to better match the subject, ensuring accuracy in the painting. Adding a touch of yellow to gray can create a cooler, greenish highlight, adding depth to the painting. My teacher advised spreading color variations to avoid isolation, enhancing the overall harmony.</p>

<h2>Maintaining Harmony and Simplicity</h2>

<p>I test values by putting down a stroke and adjusting as needed, ensuring accuracy in color matching. Reestablishing the original color helps in carving out and shaping areas, making the painting process enjoyable. The variations of color achieved with just two colors, plus black and white, are impressive and maintain harmony. Overusing colors can lead to losing the simplicity and harmony of the painting.</p>

<h2>Encouragement and Focus</h2>

<p>I take breaks to maintain focus and momentum, ensuring I don't lose interest in finishing the painting. I encourage others not to give up on their paintings and understand that it's okay to take breaks.</p>
