<h2>What's in Premium?</h2>

<p>This lesson covers <strong>line weight</strong> and <strong>line quality</strong>, essential skills for drawing and especially important for <strong>gesture drawing</strong>. You'll learn about <strong>C, S, and I lines</strong>â€”the foundational lines used to simplify complex forms and convey motion. We explore how to use these lines to create depth, show overlap, and develop your unique style. By understanding the difference between <strong>gesture</strong> and <strong>contour</strong>, you'll be able to capture the action and flow in your drawings. Practice exercises will help you build intuition and improve your line work over time.</p>
