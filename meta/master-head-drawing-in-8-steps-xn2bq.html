<p>For homework, aim to complete all eight steps.</p>

<p><strong>Step 1: Gesture</strong>

- Focus on the shape of the skull.</p>

<p><strong>Step 2: Determine the Tilt</strong>

- Identify the two-dimensional axes.</p>

<p><strong>Step 3: Draw the Jaw and Cross</strong>

- Combine the center line and brow.</p>

<p><strong>Step 4: Establish Perspective</strong>

- Examine the brow's relationship to the ear.</p>

<p><strong>Step 5: Discuss Proportions</strong>

- Mark halves and thirds between the brow and chin.</p>

<p><strong>Step 6: Develop the Side Plane</strong>

- Use four points, including the ear, jaw, and cheek.</p>

<p><strong>Step 7: Introduce the Eye Sockets</strong>

- Start with a planar visor.

- Move to a more complex three-tiered plane.</p>

<p><strong>Step 8: Develop the Nose</strong>

- From the keystone to the tip, and then to the base.

- Consider the large area of the denture sphere and the chin.</p>

<h2>Homework Assignment</h2>

<p><strong>Drawing Practice</strong>

- Draw 20 heads.

- Half should build on prior assignments, focusing on steps up to five or six.

- The other half should start new, working through all steps.</p>

<p><strong>Time Management</strong>

- Aim for each drawing to be a 10-minute exercise.

- Extending to 15 minutes is acceptable.</p>

<p><strong>Goals</strong>

- Encourage repetition to ingrain the process into thinking and muscle memory.

- Avoid over-focusing on details to create routine and habit through practice.</p>

<p><strong>Feedback</strong>

- Your work will be critiqued.</p>
