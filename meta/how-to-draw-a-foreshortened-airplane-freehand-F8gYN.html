<h2>Setting Up the Grid and Vanishing Points</h2>

<p>In this demonstration, I'll freehand draw a <strong>foreshortened airplane</strong>. While it's not daringly foreshortened, it's still a good exercise in perspective drawing. I start by establishing my <strong>vanishing points</strong>. I'll let the second vanishing point be well off the page. To give myself some structure, I draw a <strong>grid</strong> with <strong>vertical lines</strong>. I'll taper the verticals ever so slightly.</p>

<h2>Drawing the Front Face</h2>

<p>I decide where to place the front of the airplane. In my rough sketch, I establish the front face right about here. Conveniently, I have a fairly square front face on the grid. I scribe the front face there, making sure it's square in perspective because the front of the plane is very much a square in perspective. Here, <strong>proportions</strong> matter more than in previous demos.</p>

<h2>Establishing Proportions</h2>

<p>Next, I draw lines going back to the vanishing point, and this creates a <strong>right-angled box</strong>. The depth of the plane is a bit less than <strong>two squares</strong>. So, I mark the depth back at about this point on the grid. The next section back is about the same length. I could get it exact by running diagonal lines, a trick I'll show you later, but for now, I'm estimating.</p>

<p>I mark the back end of the airplane here. As I extend it back, I notice it's not a square back there, so I adjust my proportions accordingly. This is the time to fuss with proportions, not after we've started adding more details. I trim off a bit because it feels wiser.</p>

<h2>Accounting for Taper</h2>

<p>Now, I need to account for the <strong>taper</strong> of the airplane. Before putting in the wings, I ensure the taper is accurate. I can't rely on the taper until I'm sure the other side of the airplane is visible and properly placed on the grid.</p>

<p>At the front, the very front face is inside the box a little bit, meaning it's <strong>narrower on the x-axis</strong> and <strong>shorter on the y-axis</strong>, but <strong>centered</strong>. I scribe this front face accordingly, and this area around it will be carved out.</p>

<p>To find where this corner goes, I draw lines from the corners of the smaller front face to the corresponding corners of the larger box. Even though the front face moves in, it almost overlaps what was underneath, so it doesn't seem that different.</p>

<h2>Adding the Canopy</h2>

<p>Now, I add the <strong>dome on top</strong> of the airplane, the canopy. It's centered between the front part of the right-angled box and the back part. When we get to <strong>ellipses</strong>, we will see that the dome goes about here on an axis. I'm not taking the time to explain ellipses in depth now, but I'll place the footprint of the canopy using an ellipse that's more open, meaning a wider eccentricity, so it appears more circular rather than narrow.</p>

<p>I adjust the ellipse until it has the correct eccentricity. All I'm doing here is placing the <strong>footprint</strong> of the canopy. It will go up as a <strong>half-circle</strong>, and we could use a perfect circle template to place that on there if needed. I have to forget about the part behind it, since it would be hidden, and focus on the front. I run lines from the edges of the ellipse to the center, which helps define the canopy's shape.</p>

<h2>Adjusting the Tail Section</h2>

<p>The back part of the plane is <strong>narrower</strong> left to right. Looking at the ortho, I see that the back of the plane is narrower than the full box. I guess it's narrower by about this much. It's also <strong>shorter</strong> and <strong>higher</strong>. So, I lift it up about this much on the back of the box.</p>

<p>I draw a rectangle on the back that's not too far off. Maybe it should be a little more square when it includes the back wings, but it's good enough. Now, I draw lines from the corners of this rectangle to the corresponding corners of the main box to establish the taper.</p>

<h2>Drawing the Tail</h2>

<p>The tail needs to be added next. I estimate the height of the tail, which comes out of the center of this line. I ensure it's <strong>centered</strong> and place it lightly. How far forward does it go? All the way up to the line we placed earlier. I run this line across.</p>

<p>To get the shape of the tail, I run a <strong>center line</strong> from the top to the base, and it should land right here. I angle the tail back at about <strong>20 degrees</strong>, not quite 45 degrees. If it went straight up, it would cut into about here. So, I try that angle for the tail.</p>

<h2>Drawing the Back Wings</h2>

<p>Next, I estimate the <strong>back wings</strong>. From the top view, they're less than a square out here. I mark this point and need to find the corresponding point on the other side, ensuring the wings are <strong>symmetrical</strong>. The wings go straight back, so I aim them along the grid lines.</p>

<p>I determine how far they come forward. By running a line across here, I find where they begin. I create a rectangular wing by running lines straight out and then decide how far back it goes, about the same ratio as the tail. I connect the points, which establishes symmetrical wings.</p>

<h2>Cleaning Up the Drawing</h2>

<p>Now, I clean up the drawing. I might erase some of the scaffolding lines that confuse the image. I darken the important lines. I adjust any lines that were off, ensuring <strong>vertical lines remain vertical</strong>. A few quick cleanups can make the whole thing look more deliberate and help forgive the rough edges.</p>

<h2>Drawing the Main Wings</h2>

<p>The main wings are <strong>thicker</strong>, almost twice as thick as the back wings. I estimate their thickness based on the height I lifted up earlier. I need to see over to the other side of the airplane, drawing the parts that are not immediately visible to establish symmetry.</p>

<p>I look at the ortho and see that the width of the wings is about the depth of the whole plane, so they will be <strong>plenty wide</strong>. On the grid, I make sure the wings go out sufficiently, aiming along the correct grid lines.</p>

<p>I lift up the wing the same amount of height as before, and draw the top of the wing. I figure out where the wing <strong>tapers back</strong>, halfway along the wing, and connect the points. Now, it's easy to connect these dots, and I have a scaffolding for symmetrical wings.</p>

<h2>Final Touches</h2>

<p>With the wings and tail in place, I can start adding <strong>final touches</strong>. I clean up any lines, making them clearer and more deliberate. I might use a thinner lead for finer details. I ensure any <strong>ellipses</strong>, like the canopy and the nose of the plane, are correctly drawn.</p>

<p>For the <strong>nose</strong> of the plane, I find the center of the front face and draw an ellipse that represents the round point, or propeller, on the front. I draw a straight line out, angled appropriately, and estimate how far out it should go.</p>

<p>Finally, I clean up the drawing further, erasing any unnecessary lines and refining the important ones. I adjust any discrepancies, such as the tapering of lines that might have been off. By the time I'm done, I have a <strong>freehand foreshortened airplane</strong> drawn in perspective.</p>

<p>We're ready to tackle another one in a more daring position.</p>
