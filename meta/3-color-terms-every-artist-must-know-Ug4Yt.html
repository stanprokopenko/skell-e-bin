<p>Hi everyone, I'm Marco Bucci, here to help you get started with using color in your digital paintings. When it comes to color, it's important we use the same <strong>vocabulary</strong>. There are three main ways to modify a color: <strong>hue</strong>, <strong>saturation</strong>, and <strong>value</strong>.</p>

<h2>Hue</h2>

<p><strong>Hue</strong> is the <strong>name of the color</strong>, red, green, blue, etc. The <strong>color wheel</strong> displays hues in a circular arrangement. Digital painting apps provide a <strong>color picker</strong> with a hue wheel to select different hues.</p>

<h3>Primary and Secondary Colors</h3>

<p>The three <strong>primary colors</strong> are <strong>red</strong>, <strong>blue</strong>, and <strong>yellow</strong>. They can't be created by mixing other colors, but they mix to form other colors:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Red + Yellow = Orange</strong></li>

<li><strong>Red + Blue = Violet</strong></li>

<li><strong>Yellow + Blue = Green</strong></li>

</ul>

<p>These are <strong>secondary colors</strong>. The color wheel shows this progression, with secondaries between the primaries they derive from.</p>

<h2>Saturation</h2>

<p><strong>Saturation</strong> is the <strong>intensity or vibrancy</strong> of a hue. A highly saturated color is vivid, while a <strong>desaturated</strong> color moves toward <strong>gray</strong>. Desaturating colors introduces grays, which are common to all hues, making transitions smoother.</p>

<p>Overusing fully saturated colors can be overwhelming. By <strong>neutralizing</strong> (desaturating) colors, they harmonize better, creating a more pleasing aesthetic.</p>

<h2>Value</h2>

<p><strong>Value</strong> refers to the <strong>lightness or darkness</strong> of a color. Independent of color, value can be shown with a <strong>grayscale</strong> from white to black. Value is crucial because it defines the <strong>light and form</strong> in your work. You can remove color from an image, and its shapes and forms remain clear.</p>

<p>Practicing in <strong>grayscale</strong> helps focus on value without the complexity of color.</p>

<p>We've covered the key terms: <strong>hue</strong>, <strong>saturation</strong>, and <strong>value</strong>. Understanding these concepts is essential for effective use of color in digital painting. With this foundation, you're ready to explore deeper into color theory.</p>
