<p>In this lesson, we'll work on poses that fall outside the category of straight up-and-down, weight-on-one-leg types of poses. Those are great for introducing the technique and organizing your figure while keeping the big idea or story in mind. But in reality, you'll encounter a variety of poses that require you to <strong>adapt your approach</strong>.</p>

<p>Our goal is to see how <strong>malleable</strong> our method is by extending it to different examples.</p>

<h2>Revisiting the Basic Gesture Approach</h2>

<p>Remember that when you start your lay-in, you're still interpreting what you see through the <strong>lines and rhythms</strong> you're using. You have the four lines for the spine, the cervical, thoracic, lumbar, and the pelvis. But now, you'll start dealing with the issue of <strong>foreshortening</strong>. At this stage, you're at a bit of a deficit because you're only allowing yourself to use line and rhythm. That's how this technique grows.</p>

<p>In terms of the overall gesture, this is your <strong>scaffolding</strong>. The next steps would be adding shapes, creating the rib cage and pelvis forms, developing them into perspectives, and then adding anatomy. There's a long development to this. As you start to look at other positions, you want to see how much you can get out of this without having to do all that extra.</p>

<h2>Dealing with Foreshortening</h2>

<p>Remember, you want to keep gesture as something <strong>notational</strong> so that you're keeping in touch with your idea and whether or not it's working at this stage. Try to exercise that <strong>discipline</strong> without going into added elements of shape and overlap of perspective.</p>

<p>Here's some tips and ways to think about getting in touch with different views and poses:</p>

<h3>Flipping the Spine Lines</h3>

<p>When you have poses that involve bending forward or backward, you can adjust your standard set of lines. Instead of drawing the cervical, thoracic, lumbar, and pelvis in the typical sequence, you can <strong>flip</strong> them. For a figure bending forward, you might put the stretch on the back and the pinch on the front.</p>

<p>This way, you're not creating a new technique for every pose, you're just adjusting what exists.</p>

<h3>Adjusting Lengths for Foreshortening</h3>

<p>In dealing with foreshortening, think of it as controlling the exposure of the length of a rhythm. The average length of an arm or leg will appear shorter when it's coming toward you or moving away. You can shorten the lines to reflect this and use wrapping lines to indicate the degree to which the form is wrapping in perspective.</p>

<p>For example, if an arm is coming toward you, you might make the upper arm shorter than usual and increase the degree of the wrapping lines to show that it's closer.</p>

<h2>Applying the Approach to Different Poses</h2>

<h3>Poses Not on a Weight-Bearing Leg</h3>

<p>You can still use the <strong>same approach</strong> even when the pose isn't on a weight-bearing leg. You might not have the same larger relational measurements to work from, like the bottom of the pelvis being halfway down the figure. But you can still see the same properties of the <strong>spine</strong> and the ideas of <strong>weight and balance</strong>.</p>

<p>When drawing the legs, you might not be able to maintain their proportion by thinking about halfway and matching the torso above. But you can apply proportional relationships within the legs themselves. The length of the upper leg can be very close to the length of the lower leg. In terms of your rhythm, you can keep those lines somewhat equal.</p>

<h3>Seated and Crouched Poses</h3>

<p>For poses where the figure is crouched or seated, you can adjust your approach by <strong>flipping</strong> the sequence of lines. If you want to bend someone, take the lines you use for the spine and flip them. Instead of the stretch being on the front, put it on the back, and vice versa. This gives you the feeling of pinch and stretch in the appropriate areas.</p>

<p>Remember, you're taking what exists and angling it differently to match the lean. This way, you don't need a new technique just because the figure is leaning over.</p>

<h3>Dealing with Subtle Poses</h3>

<p><strong>Subtlety</strong> in gesture can sometimes be the <strong>hardest</strong> to capture. A front-facing pose might not inherently seem interesting. In these cases, you can use line weight and wrapping lines to indicate depth and foreshortening.</p>

<p>For example, you might darken the lines that are closer to you and keep the lines that are farther away lighter. You can also use wrapping lines to show that a limb is subtly moving forward or backward.</p>

<h3>Foreshortened Limbs</h3>

<p>When dealing with limbs that are foreshortened, adjust the lengths of your rhythms to reflect the <strong>perspective</strong>. The controlled exposure of the length of a rhythm helps indicate foreshortening.</p>

<p>Think of the average length for an arm or leg. When the limb comes forward or across, make it shorter in your drawing. Increase the degree to which you use wrapping lines to show that the form is wrapping in perspective.</p>

<h2>Tips for Drawing Complex Poses</h2>

<h3>Using Asymmetry and Gesture</h3>

<p>Remember that <strong>asymmetry</strong> is prevalent in the body's design. For example, when drawing the foot from different angles, you can think about the asymmetrical design of the foot's padding, arch, and toes. Using gesture to capture these asymmetries can enhance your drawing.</p>

<h3>Observational Measurements</h3>

<p>Even though this is an <strong>analytic approach</strong>, you should always balance or integrate <strong>observational methods</strong>. Sometimes, it can be helpful to use relational measurements, such as noting how much lower the knee is than the head, or using plumb lines.</p>

<p>Everything should be welcome as long as it makes sense to your idea.</p>

<h3>Avoiding Tangents</h3>

<p>When dealing with difficult poses or foreshortening, be mindful of <strong>tangents</strong>. It's already challenging when space is collapsing, so you want to avoid areas where lines might create confusion.</p>

<p>For example, if an arm is overlapping with a leg in your drawing, you might adjust the pose slightly to avoid a tangent.</p>

<h3>Anticipating Development</h3>

<p>While you're focusing on <strong>gesture</strong> and not bringing in shapes or volumes yet, remember that these aspects will come later in your drawing. Knowing that you'll develop the geometries and add muscle later frees your thinking to make the gesture without being consumed by other details.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p>By testing the <strong>extremes</strong> and applying your <strong>rhythmic approach</strong> to various poses, you can maintain your core method while adapting to new challenges. The key is to adjust your lines and rhythms to match the pose, whether the figure is bending, leaning, or foreshortened.</p>

<p>Keep gesture as something notational to stay in touch with your idea and ensure it's working at this stage. By refining your approach and integrating tips for dealing with complex poses, you'll be better equipped to handle any variety that comes your way.</p>
