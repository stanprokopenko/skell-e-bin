<p>In this session, I'm going to do three gesture drawings from reference images of people with a variety of ethnic backgrounds and age demographics. The goal is to explore different <strong>lip types and shapes</strong>, and to share my process of approaching gesture, especially when it comes to mouths.</p>

<h2>Gesture Drawing 1: Front View with Goatee</h2>

<h3>Starting with the Denture Sphere</h3>

<p>I like to begin by drawing an <strong>egg shape</strong>, almost like an elongated sphere. This represents the <strong>denture sphere</strong>, where the teeth are. The lips are not flat, they wrap around the roundness of this denture sphere. Including this helps me keep the <strong>perspective of the lips</strong> in mind, as they wrap around.</p>

<h3>Establishing the Mouth</h3>

<p>Next, I <strong>roughly indicate the corners of the mouth</strong> and connect them with a straight line. I go in very soft, focusing on nailing the <strong>tilt of the lip line</strong>. In the reference image, the lips are tilted upward along with the nose, so I make sure to capture that with the initial line.</p>

<p>I then roughly establish the <strong>lip line</strong> where the lips meet, and add a little dash to show the <strong>center of the upper lip</strong>. This also acts as the beginning of the midline that I use to divide the face in half vertically for symmetry.</p>

<h3>Defining the Lips</h3>

<p>I establish the <strong>cupid's bow</strong>, noticing that the lip line is a bit more flat and doesn't match the cupid's bow as much as in previous models. There's a lot of <strong>variation with lips</strong>, so it's good to memorize the canon so you know what you're deviating from. This helps when you're trying to <strong>push certain features</strong> in caricatures or characters.</p>

<p>I rough in the middle line of the lower lip and pretend I can see that <strong>upside-down keystone shape</strong> below the lower lip line, adding a bit of value there. I put the <strong>upper lip in shadow</strong>, and add little circles to suggest the <strong>donut hole indentation</strong> of the corners of the mouth.</p>

<h3>Simplifying Facial Hair</h3>

<p>The model has a <strong>goatee</strong>. Instead of drawing individual hairs, I <strong>simplify the overall silhouette</strong> of the goatee before breaking it up into smaller shapes. Once that's done, it's easier to start adding smaller details. I recommend simplifying complex textures like hair into larger shapes first.</p>

<h3>Adding Facial Features</h3>

<p>I indicate the <strong>septum</strong>, a little tie shape, that feeds up into the base of the nose. I draw a horizontal line to find the <strong>base of the nostrils</strong>, and I make sure it matches the perspective of the mouth. I block in the <strong>nasolabial folds</strong>, and I give thickness to the base of the <strong>wings of the nose</strong>.</p>

<p>Even though the lip line seems pretty flat, I still break up that straight line slightly with a suggestion of the <strong>middle tubercle</strong>. The plane turns inward quicker with his lips, it is not as rounded as on previous models.</p>

<p>I punch that line just above the goatee, and notice a gradient in the goatee where it's <strong>darker towards the bottom</strong>. I roughly indicate that as the planes turn away from the light source, with lines feeding into the <strong>jowls</strong>.</p>

<h3>Refining and Correcting</h3>

<p>I break up the goatee into clumps rather than individual hairs and erase some construction lines to clean up the drawing. I add a <strong>ball to suggest the volume of the chin</strong>, and add a few <strong>modeling lines</strong> to give it more form.</p>

<p>I realize I made his <strong>nose too wide</strong> and consequently made his right cheek too wide, so I adjust that. It's important to constantly <strong>check your proportions</strong> and make corrections as needed.</p>

<h3>Key Features to Note</h3>

<ul>

<li><strong>Philtrum</strong>: Feeds up into the septum.</li>

<li><strong>Dark accents at the corners of the mouth</strong>.</li>

<li><strong>Cupid's bow</strong>.</li>

<li><strong>Tubercles</strong>.</li>

<li><strong>Nasolabial fold</strong>.</li>

<li><strong>Upside-down keystone shape</strong>: Recedes back and feeds down into the top of the chin.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Gesture Drawing 2: Profile View of an Older Woman</h2>

<h3>Starting with the Denture Sphere</h3>

<p>Again, I start with a simple denture sphere. From the <strong>profile</strong>, the lips have an overall <strong>slanted orientation</strong>, so I add a little mark to get started.</p>

<h3>Establishing the Lips</h3>

<p>I find the lip line, noting that the <strong>bottom lip recedes further back</strong> behind the upper lip. I make sure to capture that. I add the upside-down keystone shape. She has a <strong>rounder chin</strong> with more fat, so we don't see that sharp edge that the skull usually provides.</p>

<h3>Adding Facial Features</h3>

<p>I indicate the <strong>corner of the mouth</strong> and lightly block out the <strong>bulb of the nose</strong>. The <strong>philtrum runs up towards the septum</strong> of the nose, which is that middle part between the nostrils. From the profile, when the head's not tilted, you can see a decent portion of that <strong>nostril</strong> being revealed.</p>

<p>We have the <strong>alar fat forming the wing of the nose</strong>, and her nose is a bit more bulbous, so I add more volume to that. Remember, the <strong>bulb is comprised of two pieces of the greater alar cartilage</strong>.</p>

<p>I go back to the top of the upper lip and add the <strong>cupid's bow</strong>, which swoops back into the corner of the mouth. I hold that in shadow.</p>

<h3>Capturing Age and Weight</h3>

<p>She has more pronounced <strong>jowls</strong>, being older, with a bit more weight and fat. I add the <strong>cast shadow on the lower lip</strong>, and feed it into the <strong>core shadow</strong> there. Her chin is not very round, so I rough in some value there. I add the <strong>core shadow on her cheek</strong>, and I'm about done with this one.</p>

<h3>Adding the Neck and Finishing Touches</h3>

<p>I add her <strong>neck</strong>, and can see the <strong>maxilla feeding into the nose</strong>. I block out the shape of the cheek and throw that into shadow. I darken the drawing a bit more to add contrast, making the neck and other areas in shadow pop.</p>

<h3>Key Observations</h3>

<ul>

<li><strong>Mouth Placement</strong>: The side of the mouth doesn't go back that far. If you draw a line from the back of the nostrils to the corner of the mouth, it's not that far back. It typically lines up close to the <strong>front of the eye</strong>. Amateurs might draw the mouth going too far back, which looks unnatural.</li>

<li><strong>Cupid's Bow</strong> - Has the end flattening out, feeding into the corner of the mouth. The line steps up, slips up, and comes down a bit. Its overall orientation is an <strong>upward angle</strong>, the profile of the mouth.</li>

<li><strong>Philtrum and Nasolabial Fold</strong>: The philtrum feeds up to the septum. The crease of the nasolabial fold feeds down into the <strong>jowls</strong>. Heavier models or older ones will have a more pronounced nasolabial fold. Thinner and younger models have less definition, blending more with the muzzle and cheek.</li>

<li><strong>Overall Flow</strong>: Remember the overall flow of the mouth shape from the profile, it steps in, comes out, steps in, and comes out a bit, then recedes back to the neck.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Gesture Drawing 3: Profile with Fuller Lips</h2>

<h3>Starting with the Nose and Denture Sphere</h3>

<p>For our final gesture, I start off with the <strong>nose</strong> and then draw a light <strong>denture sphere</strong> to give me a place to work off of.</p>

<h3>Establishing the Lips</h3>

<p>I lightly lock in the general direction of the shapes of her lips. She has a very <strong>subtle smile</strong>, with the corners of the lips turned up slightly. The perspective is <strong>top-down slightly</strong> because we can see the upper lip overlapping the lower lip.</p>

<p>Drawing a line connecting the bottom and upper lip, I see they're fairly close in vertical alignment. Her <strong>chin recedes back</strong> quite a bit before meeting the bottom plane of the jaw.</p>

<h3>Emphasizing Tubercles and Overlaps</h3>

<p>You can really see the <strong>tubercles</strong>, they are very pronounced. The tubercle on the upper lip that's closest to us, <strong>overlaps the middle tubercle</strong>. Remember, they're soft ovoid volumes. I add a <strong>core shadow</strong> because that side of the lip falls into shadow.</p>

<p>There's a slight plane that cuts in and recedes back, and we have the front of the middle tubercle. I pull that core shadow forward a bit more and block in the <strong>area of occlusion</strong> for the corner of the mouth.</p>

<h3>Capturing Lip Shapes and Planes</h3>

<p>Her upper profile has more of an <strong>S-curve</strong>, so I capture that. Her <strong>cupid's bow</strong> has a different shape this time, with a longer tail that arches back at a more <strong>flattened slope</strong> into the corner of the mouth.</p>

<p>There's a <strong>receding plane under the lip</strong>, which I cast into shadow, along with a <strong>cast shadow under the nose</strong>. I'm trying to get the <strong>thickness of the wing of the nose</strong>.</p>

<p>Here, we can see the planes <strong>turning inward</strong>, getting sucked into the corner of the mouth. There's a slight indication of where the wing conjoins with the <strong>ball of the nose</strong>, so I indicate that.</p>

<h3>Key Details to Note</h3>

<ul>

<li><strong>Thickness of the Wing of the Nostril</strong>: Always indicate this, we don't want paper-thin nostrils.</li>

<li><strong>Septum</strong>: There's a little plane that upturns slightly and can catch more light. It's good to accentuate or downplay this as needed.</li>

<li><strong>Cupid's Bow</strong>: This one has a longer tail, arching back into the corner of the mouth.</li>

<li><strong>Lateral Tubercle Overlapping the Center Tubercle</strong>: Adding this overlap adds depth and volume to the lips.</li>

<li><strong>Upper Lip Overlapping the Lower Lip</strong>: This overlap also helps add depth.</li>

<li><strong>First Plane Under the Lower Lip</strong>: It recedes back into the top of the chin.</li>

</ul>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p>These gesture drawings help us observe and capture the variety of lip shapes and features across different individuals. By paying attention to <strong>anatomical landmarks</strong>, <strong>overlaps</strong>, and <strong>planes</strong>, we can add depth and realism to our drawings of mouths.</p>

<p>Now, we're ready to move on to the <strong>color render</strong>, and then onto the most exciting part, the <strong>full portrait</strong>, where we'll apply everything we've learned to the whole face with all its features.</p>
