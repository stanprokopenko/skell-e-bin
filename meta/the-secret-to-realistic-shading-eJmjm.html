<p>We know that perspective adds depth to drawings, but perspective alone isn't enough to make a drawing look realistic. The secret often lies in effectively shading light and shadow. Understanding how light interacts with forms is the key to making your drawings look three-dimensional. Proper shading can have a bigger impact on depth and realism than perspective alone.</p>

<p>I've seen many students struggle with this. They draw beautiful outlines but then flatten their forms with incorrect shading. Let's not do that anymore. Let's learn how to shade!</p>

<h2>Planes</h2>

<p>When <strong>light hits an object</strong>, it reveals the object's <strong>planes</strong>. Think of them as small, flat facets across the surface. Even on smooth forms, imagining them as composed of many smaller planes helps you understand how the form turns. Planes facing the light are part of the <strong>light family</strong>, and planes facing away are part of the <strong>shadow family</strong>. When you shade, you need to clearly communicate which parts of the object are in light and which are in shadow. This simple organization of values into two families does the most in communicating form. It's not everything, but it's definitely the place to start.</p>

<h2>Parts of Light and Shadow</h2>

<p>Let's start simple: a sphere on a surface with one light source.</p>

<p>Light on form is typically broken down into distinct zones. You'll see these divisions more clearly on simple forms with simple lighting, but once you get it, you can apply it to anything. Before we get into details, let's quickly introduce the elements of light on form.</p>

<p>First, there's the <strong>terminator</strong>. The terminator is the edge where light transitions into shadow. Beyond it is the <strong>form shadow</strong>, the area turning away from the light source. It's different from the <strong>cast shadow</strong>, which occurs when an object blocks light from hitting another surface.</p>

<p>On the lit side, we have the <strong>center light</strong>. That's the point facing directly toward the light source. As the form turns away from the center light, we see darker and darker <strong>halftones</strong> until they reach the terminator and then become shadow. <strong>Highlights</strong> are reflections of the light source itself, so you won't see them on matte materials.</p>

<p>Within the shadows, <strong>reflected light</strong>, light bouncing around the environment, bounces into the shadow and gently lightens some of it. The darkest part of a form shadow is usually along the terminator. That dark part along the terminator is known as the <strong>core shadow</strong>. Finally, there are <strong>occlusion shadows</strong>. You'll see them in tight crevices, where objects touch. Occlusion shadows are commonly the darkest values, they are like the highlights of the shadow family.</p>

<h2>Establishing the Value Structure</h2>

<p>You already know how to think in terms of limited value groups, like light, medium, and dark. Let's use that to group the elements we just learned into value zones with hard edges. No blending or gradations, let's just observe the values.</p>

<p>Separate the light and shadow by blocking in your entire shadow area with a darker value representing the reflected light. You're saying, "this is the lightest that the shadow can get."</p>

<p>In the light family, think of three values. If the form you're drawing is very matte, without a clear highlight, then use three values for the halftones. The <strong>lightest halftone</strong> zone is the biggest, and the <strong>dark halftone</strong> is the smallest. If the form does have a highlight, then simplify the halftones to just dark halftone and light halftone. Use that third value, the brightest value, for a clear <strong>highlight</strong> shape.</p>

<p>In the shadow family, within the form shadow, think of just two values. The value you put down originally to define the shadow is the <strong>reflected light</strong>. It's the lightest part of the shadow. Add a darker value for the <strong>core shadow</strong>.</p>

<p>You can give the <strong>occlusion shadow</strong> the same value as the core shadow, and you would have a total of five values. This is a great way to map out the values: three in the lights and two in the shadows, favoring more detail and complexity in the lights. In reality, the occlusion shadow is usually even darker than the core shadow. As cast shadows go farther away from the object, the edges get softer. If you want to get really technical, you can use some of those values from the light family to transition the cast shadow into the light around the blurry edges.</p>

<p>Shading form isn't as simple as smudging gradations across your shapes. It's never a linear gradation from light to shadow. Instead, you need to consider the way values change as they move across the form:</p>

<ul>

<li>The transitions within the lighter halftones are very subtle.</li>

<li>The jump from halftone to core shadow is usually quicker and more obvious.</li>

<li>After the core shadow, the value gets lighter again because of the reflected lights.</li>

<li>Then darker for the occlusion shadow.</li>

<li>Lighter again as the occlusion transitions to the cast shadow.</li>

</ul>

<p>Of course, this is a simplified example to help you understand the relationships. This pattern and the values used here are not a hard rule. The exact value steps will vary based on the object and light source, but this is a good starting point to get familiar with a common pattern you'll see. What matters most is maintaining the correct <strong>relationships</strong> between these values.</p>

<p>As you practice, you'll develop an intuition for how light describes form, and you'll become more comfortable with all the subtle shifts in value that create realistic depth. You'll start to feel when a value or transition is wrong. Light is your tool for creating the illusion of three dimensions on a flat surface. Master it, and your drawings will never look flat again.</p>

<p>Coming up, I'll do a demonstration going over all of this slowly and in much more detail.</p>
