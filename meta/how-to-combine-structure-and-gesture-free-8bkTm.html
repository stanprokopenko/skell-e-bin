<h2>What's in Premium?</h2>

<p>Learn how I blend solid, three-dimensional structure with flowing, lifelike gesture—what I call “matter and energy.” I simplify arms, torsos, and other forms into basic shapes (boxes, tubes, eggs) and then add curves to give them movement. We’ll cover strategies for unifying foreground and background, connecting big shapes, and blocking in shadows and lights to create depth. You’ll see how I train my eye to spot underlying shapes in complex subjects and build convincing value with simple shadow shapes. It’s a straightforward approach that helps your drawings feel both solid and alive.</p>
