<p>Hi, I'm Elaine DeBayan, a character designer and animator in the industry. Currently, I'm the <strong>lead character designer</strong> on <em>My Adventures with Superman</em> at Warner Brothers Animation. Previously, I've worked with Paramount, Powerhouse, The Line, and Marvel. My work tends to have a stylized approach, and I believe that understanding <strong>anatomy</strong> is crucial, especially when stylizing art.</p>

<p>Proko is a fantastic resource for learning anatomy, and I hope to give some insight into how you can use your <strong>anatomical knowledge</strong> to push your art. It's essential to have that <strong>foundation and structure</strong>, especially in character design for animation. I'm excited to share how I stylize my work and show dynamism as efficiently and personally as I can.</p>

<h2>Embracing a Stylized Approach</h2>

<p>I often start my drawings <strong>loose and gestural</strong>. For example, I once drew my original character while on vacation in Mexico. I'm a big fan of pinups and magazine photography, especially candid shots. Initially, the drawing was rough and not very appealing, but I wanted to focus on making the <strong>hand the focal point</strong>. I'm a big fan of <strong>perspective</strong>, it's a great way to have fun and set up compositions easily once you understand it.</p>

<h3>Inspiration from Animation Studios</h3>

<p>A lot of the art that inspires me plays around with perspective, like works from <strong>Trigger</strong>, <strong>Studio Mir</strong>, and <strong>Avatar: The Last Airbender</strong>. These have been significant landmarks for me in terms of what I want to emulate in my art. I'm always trying to capture that dynamic feeling in any way I can.</p>

<h2>Revisiting and Refining Sketches</h2>

<p>Sometimes a drawing doesn't work out the first time, and that's <strong>okay</strong>. I drew a dynamic pose during a lecture in school a couple of years ago. The first pass wasn't great, the legs were too wonky, but it was informative for the next attempt. I reworked it, straightened the leg, and added a curve with a scythe to enhance the composition.</p>

<h3>Building on Initial Sketches</h3>

<p>Usually, I like to use as much of the <strong>original shapes</strong> as I can. Sometimes I don't even lower the opacity, I just duplicate the layer and erase and redraw as I go. When dealing with <strong>dynamic poses</strong>, I often rely on both my <strong>mental library</strong> and <strong>references</strong>. If I have a specific element in mind, like a hand at a cool angle, I will build the rest of the character around that. Other times, I'll use references to guide me.</p>

<h2>The Value of Reference in Art</h2>

<p>Using <strong>reference is crucial</strong>. In the past, I tried to rely solely on my imagination, but I realized how limiting that was. Using reference as a guide for your decisions strengthens your art. Every stroke you make is a <strong>decision</strong>, and everything you put on the page is something others will see. It's important to have the <strong>foundation and understanding</strong> behind what you're drawing.</p>

<h3>Using 3D Models and Tools</h3>

<p>I frequently use <strong>3D models</strong> in <strong>Clip Studio Paint</strong>. For example, I did reference studies of Superman when I first started on the show. Clip Studio has a 3D head you can manipulate, adjusting focal lengths and perspectives. I tried to fit the 3D head to the model sheet of Clark and then either traced over it or kept it as a side reference while drawing. It's a great way to understand <strong>proportions and landmarks</strong>.</p>

<p>I also use a website called <strong>Pose Maniacs</strong>, which offers free 3D models of poses and musculature. You can turn them around, change focal lengths, and view them in different perspectives. It's helped me understand how objects move in space and how cameras work.</p>

<h2>Letting Inspiration Guide You</h2>

<p>I love to let my mind fly and fill pages with <strong>ideas</strong>. Sometimes I'll sketch gestures from a K-pop dance video or draw from imagination. Dancing is excellent for <strong>dynamic inspiration</strong> because it involves composing the body to look satisfying.</p>

<h3>Combining Personal Style with Practice</h3>

<p>I often start with the head as my favorite landmark and sculpt the rest of the body around that gesture. I enjoy drawing characters with <strong>swords</strong> because they're great for <strong>leading the eye</strong> and adding dynamism. I try to keep things <strong>simple</strong> and use my own <strong>instincts</strong> and <strong>shape language</strong>.</p>

<h2>Posting Your Work and Opportunities</h2>

<p>Posting your work on social media can lead to <strong>unexpected opportunities</strong>. I did an animation of Percy Jackson during COVID, and my current producer, Jake Wyatt, found it. That's how I got my job on <em>My Adventures with Superman</em>. If you're excited about something, whether it's <strong>fan art</strong> or personal projects, <strong>put it out there</strong>. You never know who might see it and want to hire you.</p>

<h2>Simplifying the Process</h2>

<p>I like to keep my initial sketches <strong>messy</strong> and not spend too much time thinking about structure or shapes. It's all about getting the idea down quickly. I also use tools like the <strong>lasso fill</strong> in Clip Studio, which speeds up the process by <strong>auto-filling shapes</strong>. It's great for blocking out shapes, sketching, or shading.</p>

<h3>Animation Techniques</h3>

<p>I worked on an animation inspired by a song that made me want to move. Music is a fantastic source of <strong>inspiration</strong> for animation. In my workflow, I focus on keeping the animation informative without over-planning. In the industry, you have to <strong>work quickly</strong>, and sometimes you have to <strong>redo or redraw</strong> things, so efficiency is key.</p>

<h2>Exploring Different Mediums and Tools</h2>

<p>I use both <strong>Clip Studio Paint</strong> and <strong>Procreate</strong>, depending on my needs. Procreate is great for <strong>drawing on the go</strong>, it's straightforward and accessible. Clip Studio Paint is more robust for my computer work, and it offers features like 3D models, and the ability to transfer files between devices.</p>

<h2>Color and Finishing Touches</h2>

<p><strong>Coloring can save a lot of your art</strong>. It hides imperfections and brings everything together. I often use a <strong>layer of noise</strong> to add grit and texture. Sometimes, I'll add an overlay layer to unify the colors if they aren't popping enough. Keeping the lines a little dirty adds character and a sketchy feel that I like.</p>

<h2>Understanding Proportions and Ratios</h2>

<p>Understanding the <strong>ratio</strong> of things to one another is <strong>crucial</strong> in art. It's important in perspective and anatomy. Everything is in ratio to everything else. You can draw anything if you put a graph on top of it and know where points should go. Studying ratios helps you understand <strong>how things are built</strong>, which is half the battle in art. The rest is imagination and making decisions that make your art appealing.</p>

<h2>Consistent Practice and Warm-ups</h2>

<p>Doing <strong>warm-up sketches and studies</strong> makes a huge difference in your work. I create pages filled with <strong>gestures and poses</strong> to ensure I understand how the body works in different perspectives. As an animator, you need to be able to turn characters in any direction. Warm-ups help me stay sharp and ready to tackle any pose.</p>

<h3>Emphasizing Hands and Dynamic Shapes</h3>

<p>I'm a big fan of drawing <strong>hands first</strong>. They're complex and add a lot of interest to a piece. Focusing on hands can make a drawing feel more <strong>tangible and alive</strong>. I also pay attention to how all the shapes in a drawing work together, which adds strength and dynamism.</p>

<h2>Adapting to Different Styles</h2>

<p>Working on different projects often requires <strong>adapting to new styles</strong>. It takes homework and practice to get used to a show's specific aesthetic. Understanding anatomy and having a <strong>strong foundation</strong> allows you to lean toward another style more easily. It's about knowing the nuances, like the shape of biceps or specific proportions.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p>Drawing <strong>dynamic characters</strong> is about understanding anatomy, using references, and <strong>continuously practicing</strong>. By simplifying when needed and letting inspiration guide you, you can create art that is both personal and appealing. Don't be afraid to use <strong>tools and references</strong>, they are there to help you. And remember, <strong>sharing your work can open doors you never expected</strong>.</p>

<p>I hope my insights have given you some ideas on how to add more life to your drawings. Keep exploring, keep practicing, and most importantly, enjoy the process.</p>
