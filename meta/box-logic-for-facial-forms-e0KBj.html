<h2>Why Box Logic?</h2>

<p>You want to see the head as a <strong>box</strong> to separate its different planes. This helps you understand which areas face the front, side, top, or bottom. Even if the head is rounded, try to envision it as blocky for a clear, structured approach. Box logic makes it easier to shade, place features, and give your drawings a strong sense of form.</p>

<h2>Separating the Major Planes</h2>

<p>Focus on dividing the head into four main planes: <strong>front</strong>, <strong>side</strong>, <strong>top</strong>, and (if visible) <strong>bottom</strong>.</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Front Plane</strong>: The forehead, face, cheeks, and chin that face you.  </li>

<li><strong>Side Plane</strong>: The temple, outer cheek, and side of the jaw.  </li>

<li><strong>Top Plane</strong>: The scalp or top of the hair.  </li>

<li><strong>Bottom Plane</strong>: The underside of the chin or jaw if you can see it.</li>

</ul>

<p>When you spot a <strong>corner</strong> where two planes meet, mark that transition. In a side or three-quarter view, for example, find where the forehead turns into the temple or where the cheek turns sharply toward the ear.</p>

<h2>Applying Tone to Planes</h2>

<p>Soon, you’ll learn to assign different values or tones to each plane. For now, you only need to imagine that each plane (front, side, top, bottom) could have its own distinct value. This helps you create the <strong>illusion of depth</strong>:</p>

<p>• Darker tones often go on the planes that turn away from the light.<br />

• Lighter tones appear on the planes that face the light.<br />

• Local color (hair vs. skin) can also add contrast.</p>

<p>By distinguishing these values, you build the effect of form on the head. In future lessons, you’ll refine these shading techniques using the <strong>laws of light</strong>.</p>

<h2>Building Facial Architecture</h2>

<p>Begin with <strong>simple lines</strong> that capture the basic box logic. Here are key points to look for:</p>

<ol>

<li><strong>Eyebrow Line</strong>: Use the eyebrow as a front-edge landmark. This spot often marks the transition from the forehead’s front plane to the side planes.  </li>

<li><strong>Cheekbone Curve</strong>: Let the cheekbone line drift down from the eyebrow area. It can swing in toward the nose, helping separate the front of the face from the side.  </li>

<li><strong>Temple Line</strong>: Notice where the temple plane emerges. It can follow the hairline or show up in your figure as a subtle shift in value.  </li>

<li><strong>Jaw and Chin</strong>: The jaw often narrows down to the chin, creating a subtle corner or step forward. Mark where that front plane transitions to the side of the jaw.</li>

</ol>

<p>As you place these lines, you’re mapping out <strong>front vs. side</strong> planes. Later, you’ll break them further into smaller planes, adding more realism.</p>

<h2>Next Steps</h2>

<p>Practice drawing heads in front, three-quarter, and profile views while applying box logic. In the upcoming lessons, you’ll explore <strong>hands and feet</strong>, then dive into shading techniques. Once you’re comfortable dividing the head into planes, you’ll be ready to create a convincing sense of light and form in your portraits.</p>
