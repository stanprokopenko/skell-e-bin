<h2>Using Overlaps and Boxes</h2>

<p>When you draw toes, use a similar strategy as when you draw fingers. You can break them into <strong>tubes</strong> or <strong>boxes</strong>. This approach helps you handle the <strong>construction</strong>, <strong>connection</strong>, and <strong>perspective</strong> challenges all at once. Overlaps create a sense of depth, and box logic keeps things organized.</p>

<h2>Simplifying the Forms</h2>

<p>Think of each toe as a short, compressed version of a finger. You can carve or chisel the top to show the <strong>nail</strong>, which sits flatter on both fingers and toes. On the back side, toes have a bit more <strong>padding</strong>, so they may look rounder or like an egg with a box on top.</p>

<p>When looking at the <strong>digit breaks</strong> in toes:

- They are much shorter than finger segments.<br />

- Sometimes they appear as if they are only one or two segments.<br />

- Their motion is more subtle compared to fingers.</p>

<h2>Alignment of Toes</h2>

<p>Your <strong>big toe</strong> and <strong>second toe</strong> often project the farthest. The second toe can be longer than the big toe. The remaining toes slope or step back in a natural progression toward the <strong>little toe</strong>.</p>

<p>From a <strong>top view</strong>, the big toe can angle inward or even splay outward a bit. You might see the following:

- A slightly inward bump for the big toe.<br />

- A longer second toe.<br />

- The middle, fourth, and little toes stepping back.</p>

<p>Think about the <strong>toe knuckles</strong> (where they connect to your foot): they form a “platform” that can appear a bit wider and influences how each toe attaches.</p>

<h2>Basic Foot Construction</h2>

<p>When sketching the foot from a <strong>downward angle</strong>, consider a wedge-like shape. Keep these pointers in mind:

- The big toe may angle inward to allow a more pointed shoe shape.<br />

- The second toe remains longest and then the toes gradually get shorter toward the little toe.<br />

- Each toe can be shown as a simplified box or tube, with a <strong>flat nail plane</strong> on top.</p>

<p>When you draw a <strong>front view</strong>, the little toe might look more like a <strong>ball</strong> set to the side. They often compress under the body’s weight, especially the big toe, which has more padding.</p>

<h2>Handling Perspective and S-Curves</h2>

<p>When a foot or toe angles toward you, picture it as a <strong>cartoon duckbill</strong> shape coming forward. Each toe is like a <strong>small box</strong> or <strong>egg</strong> squashed under weight. Use <strong>nails</strong> to show the top plane and reinforce perspective.</p>

<p>Try using <strong>S-curves</strong> to show how toes drift back in space:

1. Group the first two or three toes, curving them up and over in an arc.<br />

2. Let the remaining toes curve back in a subtle reverse arc.<br />

3. This helps convey depth and overlapping forms.</p>

<p>Keep your toes <strong>compressed</strong>, <strong>overlapped</strong>, and <strong>connected</strong> in a way that shows clear structure. Group them together first, then add details like <strong>nails</strong> and <strong>padding</strong>. Apply the same box or tube logic you use for fingers, but remember toes have shorter segments and often carry your body weight, so they appear more squished.</p>

<p>Use these tips to create drawings of <strong>toes and feet</strong> that feel <strong>solid</strong>, <strong>realistic</strong>, and <strong>properly connected</strong>.</p>
