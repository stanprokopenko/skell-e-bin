<h2>What's in Premium?</h2>

<p>Explore the <strong>shape method</strong> for gesture drawing as an alternative to line-based approaches. This lesson covers:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Maintaining Fluidity</strong>: Learn techniques to prevent your drawings from feeling static, such as carrying through center lines and finding connecting rhythms.</li>

<li><strong>Emphasizing Tilt and Weight</strong>: Understand how to capture the body's natural movement by exaggerating tilts and identifying weight-bearing sides.</li>

<li><strong>Avoiding Symmetry</strong>: Discover how to introduce asymmetry to add dynamism and realism to your figures.</li>

<li><strong>Building Connections</strong>: Use relational rhythms and anatomical landmarks to create smooth transitions between shapes.</li>

<li><strong>Integrating Anatomy and Design</strong>: Incorporate anatomical details into your shapes for enhanced design and realism.</li>

<li><strong>Progressing to Light and Shadow</strong>: Learn how the shape method leads into mapping light and shadow, understanding form shadows and cast shadows, and developing surface effects.</li>

</ul>
