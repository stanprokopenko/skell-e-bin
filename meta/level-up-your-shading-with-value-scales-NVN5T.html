<h2>Why Make a Value Scale</h2>

<p>Creating a <strong>value scale</strong> teaches you to control the mediums you work with and builds patience. If you can't produce exact values in a simple scale, you can't expect to do it in complex drawings like portraits. It's beneficial to create a value scale for every medium you want to master, whether it's pencil, markers, ink, or charcoal.</p>

<p>For those of you working digitally, I encourage you to try this with a <strong>pencil</strong>.</p>

<h2>Level 1: 11-Step Value Scale</h2>

<p>Start by drawing a 1x1 inch rectangle divided into <strong>eleven squares</strong>. Use a ruler if you like, and draw the lines lightly to avoid dark lines between squares, which can hinder comparison.</p>

<p><strong>Establish your darkest value first</strong> using the darkest shade your pencils can produce, this is your <strong>value zero</strong>. The lightest value is the white of the paper, so you don't need to shade that square.</p>

<p>Fill in the squares between, aiming for a <strong>consistent gradation</strong> from dark to light. You can start from one end, the middle, or jump around, it's up to you.</p>

<h3>Tips for Level 1</h3>

<ul>

<li>Use a <strong>range of pencils</strong> (2H, HB, 2B, 4B, 6B) to achieve the full spectrum of values. Each pencil has a comfortable range.</li>

<li>Avoid pressing too hard to achieve dark values, instead, use a softer pencil like a <strong>6B</strong>.</li>

<li>For lighter values, apply a <strong>soft touch</strong> with a harder pencil like <strong>2H</strong>.</li>

<li><strong>Squint</strong> at your value scale to see if the gradation is smooth, and adjust as necessary.</li>

<li><strong>Clean shading</strong> is crucial. Avoid holes and inconsistent patches without using blending tools.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Level 1 Alternative: 5-Step Value Scale</h2>

<p>If eleven steps feel overwhelming, start with a <strong>five-step value scale</strong>. Begin with the darkest and lightest values, then fill in the middle value and the two in-between. This simplifies the gradation and reduces subtlety.</p>

<h2>Level 2: Blind Value Scale</h2>

<p>For a greater challenge, try creating a <strong>blind value scale</strong>. You'll shade each square <strong>without seeing the others</strong>.</p>

<h3>How to Create a Blind Value Scale</h3>

<ol>

<li>Cut out one or two-inch squares and <strong>number each on the back</strong>.</li>

<li>Shade each square to match its assigned value, without comparing it to the others.</li>

<li>Once all squares are done, line them up in order and see how smooth the gradation is.</li>

</ol>

<h3>Adjusting Difficulty</h3>

<ul>

<li>Start with fewer squares, like <strong>five</strong>, to make it easier.</li>

<li>For an extra challenge, <strong>randomize</strong> the order in which you shade the squares.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Optional: Marker Value Scale</h2>

<p>If you have markers, try making a value scale with them. Markers like the <strong>OLO set</strong> with cool gray shades can provide predefined values.</p>

<h3>Tips for Markers</h3>

<ul>

<li><strong>Applying markers evenly</strong> takes practice. Overlapping inconsistently can create streaks.</li>

<li>Layering the same marker adds darkness, combining markers can create in-between values.</li>

<li>Be aware of <strong>drying times</strong>, as the true value may not appear until the marker is dry.</li>

</ul>

<p>Approach these value scales with <strong>patience</strong> and take <strong>pride in your work</strong>. Practicing accurate values pays off in your drawings. Post your value scales for critiques and ensure you take <strong>high-quality photos</strong> with even lighting, as this will affect the perceived values.</p>
