<p>Hi everyone, my name is Bryce Ko. I'm a concept artist and illustrator. Many of you might know me from <strong>Sea of Stars</strong>, a game that just released. I did all the illustrations, character designs, and some of the environments, but I mostly focused on characters.</p>

<p>In this article, I'll share my process for some of my personal artwork. I'll break down the steps I took to create two illustrations: an original character from Inktober and a fan art piece of <strong>Spirited Away</strong>. So let's get started.</p>

<h2>Illustration 1: Inktober Character</h2>

<h3>Research</h3>

<p>The first piece is an original illustration I did of a character I drew during Inktober. Every day of Inktober, I kept drawing her for each theme of the day. For example, if the theme was cats, she was delivering donuts to a cat-themed universe.</p>

<p>The story behind this illustration is that my cousin once asked me to draw a cat-themed piece. I realized I didn't know how to draw cats very well, and I felt bad because he was looking forward to it. That planted a seed in my mind, I needed to <strong>learn how to draw cats</strong>.</p>

<p>I began by <strong>researching</strong>. I searched through Google Images and doodled any interesting angles or poses of cats that I found. At this stage, there aren't any hard rules, it's about exploring and getting comfortable drawing whatever you're interested in.</p>

<p>I focused on:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Drawing different angles and poses</strong> to get a 3D sense of their geometry.</li>

<li><strong>Breaking down cats into shapes</strong> that I understood, so I could draw from imagination.</li>

<li><strong>Understanding textures</strong> to define those shapes.</li>

<li><strong>Studying the skeletons</strong> to grasp what's happening with their legs and body parts.</li>

</ul>

<p>These drawings don't need to look good. Sometimes I'd make mistakes, and cover them up to not feel bad about it. The key is to draw multiple times, as many times as it takes to feel comfortable.</p>

<h3>Sketch</h3>

<p>After the research, I went straight into the <strong>sketch</strong>. Sometimes I do thumbnails first, but for this piece, I had an idea and decided to lay it out. I started with a quick and dirty version to plan what I wanted. Even though I often draw straight to ink, sometimes it's better to rough things out methodically.</p>

<h3>Line Art</h3>

<p>With the sketch done, I moved on to the <strong>line art</strong>. I refined the drawing and solidified the lines.</p>

<h3>Flats</h3>

<p>Next, I worked on the <strong>flats</strong>, which means coloring everything in. This was one of the biggest learning processes I've had throughout my artistic career. Because I work on complicated pieces, I needed to <strong>limit the number of colors</strong>. If I colored everything with its true local color, it would take forever.</p>

<p>Keeping the <strong>palette simple</strong> helps you get it done. It also makes the illustration cohesive and allows for flexibility later. I focused on:</p>

<ul>

<li>Using the <strong>least number of colors</strong> to have powerful "knobs" to adjust later.</li>

<li>Having layers for each color group (e.g., all pinks on one layer).</li>

<li>Avoiding having a million different colors that make things more difficult.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Final Piece</h3>

<p>Finally, I adjusted those flats and added a <strong>shading layer</strong> on top. This involved:</p>

<ul>

<li>Adding a <strong>multiply layer of shadows</strong>.</li>

<li>Adding highlights by coloring within the lines.</li>

<li>Bringing the piece to life by adding lighting and shadows.</li>

</ul>

<p>Comparing the flats to the final piece, you can see how adding lighting and shadows makes a big difference. It also makes things cohesive because everything feels part of the same space. This stage is so satisfying because it suddenly brings your illustration to life.</p>

<h2>Illustration 2: Spirited Away Fan Art</h2>

<h3>Research</h3>

<p>The second piece is my fan art of <strong>Spirited Away</strong>. For this illustration, I needed to do a lot more research because I hadn't ever drawn anything from "Spirited Away" before. It was a great excuse to draw things I was really inspired by.</p>

<p>I began by getting familiar with <strong>Miyazaki's style</strong> and the way he designs characters. I remember when I first drew Sen, it didn't look good, it wasn't exactly my style nor Miyazaki's style. But I soldiered on.</p>

<p>I focused on:</p>

<ul>

<li>Drawing various characters to understand their features.</li>

<li>Drawing multiple times to warm up and get comfortable.</li>

<li>Pinpointing the parts of Miyazaki's art style that I liked.</li>

<li>Considering which characters I wanted to feature in the piece.</li>

</ul>

<p>I also drew <strong>Haku</strong>, the dragon character. I wanted to capture his cool and slightly scary look. Sometimes this phase triggers a memory that inspires you and you can take it in that direction.</p>

<p>These research pages became my resource for the final piece. When I drew the final illustration, I didn't go back to Google Images, I had a sketchbook in front of me. Because I had drawn it before, I could recall my understanding more easily.</p>

<h3>Thumbnails</h3>

<p>Next, I worked on <strong>thumbnails</strong> for the composition. The first thumbnail was a horizontal orientation with Sen in her sleeveless costume. But I wanted to include more characters, so the size of the shot was too close up for me.</p>

<p>I decided on a composition where the main characters are flying over a <strong>night market</strong>. This idea was inspired by my trip to Taiwan, where I visited Raohe Night Market. It reminded me of the beginning of "Spirited Away," with amazing food and a cool atmosphere.</p>

<p>I wanted to:</p>

<ul>

<li>Have Haku and Sen soaring over the market.</li>

<li>Include as many <strong>Ghibli characters</strong> as possible in the market scene.</li>

<li>Use the night market as a backdrop to create a cohesive piece.</li>

</ul>

<p>Sometimes this phase of exploration triggers memories that inspire you. Anytime I do a piece, the more of myself I put into it, the more I connect with it. That always translates to the viewer.</p>

<h3>Line Art</h3>

<p>With the composition decided, I moved on to the <strong>line art</strong>. I dove straight in, drawing the main characters and filling the market scene with various Ghibli characters. My goal was to create an overall Ghibli piece that looks purely like "Spirited Away" at first glance. The other characters become more of a texture or mosaic in the background. If you're a super fan and you dig deep, you'd find all those Easter eggs.</p>

<h3>Flats</h3>

<p>Next, I added the <strong>flats</strong>. I was already thinking about keeping the <strong>color palette cohesive</strong>. I aimed to:</p>

<ul>

<li>Use limited colors to make adjustments easier later.</li>

<li>Squeeze colors into the closest, next best thing within my palette.</li>

<li>Allow Sen and Haku to have true-to-life colors so they stand out.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Adding Shading and Lighting</h3>

<p>After the flats, I added <strong>shading and lighting</strong>. I focused on:</p>

<ul>

<li>Adding a <strong>highlight pass</strong> instead of shadows.</li>

<li>Using light to unify everything and create a nighttime vibe.</li>

<li>Adding a gradient to move the eye towards the center.</li>

</ul>

<p>This step helped me hone in on the <strong>values</strong> for the overall piece. I wanted to achieve the atmosphere where the night market light is the main highlight source. Only things directly lit by a light source pop out, just like in a real night market.</p>

<h3>Final Piece</h3>

<p>In the final version, I <strong>crunched down the color palette</strong> further to make everything cohesive. I emphasized the nighttime atmosphere and the way the light interacts with the characters. I was very happy to achieve the look I wanted, where the scene feels cohesive and includes all the characters, but from afar, it looks like a "Spirited Away" piece.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p>That wraps up my process for my personal artwork. I hope sharing these steps gives you insight into how I approach illustrations, from research to the final piece. Remember, <strong>putting more of yourself into your work</strong> makes it more exciting and that always translates to the viewer. Whether it's learning to draw cats or creating a fan art piece filled with Easter eggs, the key is to enjoy the process and keep learning.</p>
