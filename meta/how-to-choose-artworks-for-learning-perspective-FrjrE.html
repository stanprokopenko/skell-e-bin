<p>We've looked at many marvelous images by great artists to learn perspective. However, not all great artworks are suitable for studying perspective. Some of my favorite pieces aren't ideal for this purpose. Let's explore why and see how you can choose the right artworks to enhance your understanding of perspective.</p>

<h2>Great Art Isn't Always Great for Perspective</h2>

<p>Just because an image is beautiful doesn't mean it's useful for learning perspective. For example, <strong>Kai Nielsen</strong>, a Danish illustrator who died in 1957, created stunning designs. I have his artwork in my studio as inspiration. However, I wouldn't choose his pieces to study perspective.</p>

<h3>Kai Nielsen: Beautiful Design with Limited Perspective</h3>

<p>Nielsen's work is expressive and powerful, emphasizing flat shapes. While he knew perspective, he often chose not to use it extensively. In some of his illustrations, you'll notice how vertically oriented figures hit the ground and flatten out. This shows his awareness of perspective, but he plays with <strong>flat and thick</strong> elements for compositional purposes.</p>

<h3>Albrecht D端rer: Masterful Art with Medieval Perspective</h3>

<p><strong>Albrecht D端rer</strong> created great images like heralds and insignias, which are meant to be graphic. You might wonder how to learn perspective from these. You can observe overlap in feathers and anatomy, but the lessons are limited. His famous <strong>rhinoceros</strong> was drawn mostly from imagination, based on descriptions. It circulated through Europe, influencing others' perceptions of a rhinoceros.</p>

<p>D端rer's work often reflects medieval perspective, which lacks the depth of Renaissance perspective. His horses, while charming, aren't the best examples for studying perspective. You might notice cross contours in his preliminary sketches, showing his awareness of thickness and form. But overall, D端rer's pieces aren't your first choice for perspective lessons.</p>

<h3>Hokusai and Hiroshige: Japanese Perspectives</h3>

<p><strong>Hokusai</strong>, working in the 1830s, created beautiful, expressively drawn pieces that are precursors to modern cartoons. He understood enough about horse anatomy and perspective to wrap clumps of hair around a convex neck. However, his works aren't ideal for learning perspective.</p>

<p><strong>Hiroshige</strong> used <strong>isometric perspective</strong>, making things appear as if they don't recede into the distance. This method evolved from the need to build things and was prevalent in Japanese art as perspective knowledge was introduced. In Hokusai's medieval-style perspectives, you wouldn't find practical lessons on vanishing points.</p>

<h2>The Evolution of Perspective in Art</h2>

<p>Before the Renaissance, artists had limited understanding of perspective. They used simple tricks, which gave medieval art its charm. During the Renaissance, perspective became a new science, allowing artists to make buildings on flat surfaces look like they went back hundreds of steps.</p>

<h3>Medieval Perspective: Limited Techniques</h3>

<p>In medieval art, objects like doors were drawn progressively smaller as they receded, but without precise mathematical accuracy. Artists might have used methods like the <strong>diagonal vanishing point</strong>, but it's uncertain. These pieces aren't helpful for understanding how vanishing points work, but they offer valuable design lessons.</p>

<h3>Renaissance Perspective: A New Science</h3>

<p>The Renaissance brought a revolution in artistic perspective. Artists learned to create the illusion of depth on a flat surface, making their work more realistic. This advancement is crucial for anyone wanting to study perspective seriously.</p>

<h2>Incorporating Perspective Knowledge</h2>

<p>Returning to <strong>Kai Nielsen</strong>, even though he worked in a style reminiscent of medieval illustrators, he understood perspective. In some artworks, you'll see how he uses ellipses and columns to show planes changing direction in space. He often contrasts flat and thick elements, creating a dynamic composition.</p>

<h3>Flat vs. Thick: A Composition Lesson</h3>

<p>Nielsen played games with <strong>flat and thick</strong> elements in his illustrations. He might depict flat characters against a background with depth or use thick elements to enhance the three-dimensionality of certain parts. This intentional contrast isn't a perspective lesson but a valuable composition lesson.</p>

<h3>Virginia Frances Sterrett: An Evolution of Style</h3>

<p>Many people might mistake some artworks for Nielsen's, but they were actually created by <strong>Virginia Frances Sterrett</strong>. At just 20 years old, she illustrated old French fairy tales with a technique more refined than Nielsen's. Though influenced by him, she had her own sensibilities, evolving his style further.</p>

<p>Sterrett only lived 31 years due to serious health issues, but her work remains a testament to her talent. She understood perspective and used it to create beautiful illustrations that balance flatness and depth.</p>

<h2>Finding Inspiration for Your Own Work</h2>

<p>You have access to more resources than artists back then had. In our community, you can find numerous examples that excite you and integrate the elements you love into your own work. Whether you prefer vertical compositions like Nielsen's or looking down on worlds as others did, you have the tools to explore and develop your perspective skills.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p>Not every great artwork is suitable for learning perspective. By choosing pieces that effectively demonstrate perspective principles, you can enhance your understanding and apply these lessons to your own creations. Study the works of artists who mastered perspective and consider how they incorporated it into their art. Use their examples as inspiration, and keep practicing to improve your skills.</p>

<p>I hope this has inspired you, and I look forward to seeing you in our next lesson.</p>
