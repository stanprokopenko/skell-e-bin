<p>I want to show you how to visualize and shade the head using simple 3D blobs. Drawing heads can feel complex, so this exercise lets us focus on volume and edge variety. By practicing with a <strong>blobby</strong> approach, we grow used to thinking in three dimensions without worrying about details like wrinkles or hair.</p>

<p>I’ve included reference photos you can download and follow along with. You can go for a <strong>super simple egg</strong> shape or try more <strong>detailed blobs</strong> that still stay true to the bigger forms of the head.</p>

<h2>Simple Egg Approach</h2>

<p>A quick place to start is to imagine the head as one big egg shape. Here’s how:</p>

<ol>

<li>Draw a simple egg to represent the head.  </li>

<li>Decide where the light is coming from.  </li>

<li>Establish a shadow shape on the egg. Let some edges be soft and others firm to suggest different planes.  </li>

<li>Add a <strong>blobby nose</strong> if you like. Keep it simple, just a small overlapping form with a stronger edge.</li>

</ol>

<p>Even though you’re drawing an egg, push yourself to observe which planes might transition gently and which might turn sharply.</p>

<h2>Multi-Blob Approach</h2>

<p>Once you’re comfortable with the egg, take on a slightly more intricate version. I like to identify these basic blobs:</p>

<h3>Key Blobs</h3>

<ul>

<li><strong>Cranium</strong>: A rounded mass for the top of the skull.  </li>

<li><strong>Jaw</strong>: A separate block or rounded shape that attaches to the cranium.  </li>

<li><strong>Nose</strong>: A small “Elmo-like” triangular or rounded form in front.  </li>

<li><strong>Brow Ridge</strong>: An optional form that can pop out right above the eyes.  </li>

<li><strong>Eyeballs</strong>: Spheres tucked into the eye sockets (no eyelids needed).  </li>

<li><strong>Muzzle</strong>: A “tuna can” shape for the mouth area, without lips.  </li>

<li><strong>Cheekbones</strong>: Simple, round ovals at the sides of the face.</li>

</ul>

<p>Place these blobs where you see them, but don’t worry about exact proportions. Focus on trying to think of each area as a volume in space.</p>

<h3>Shading the Blobs</h3>

<p>After roughing in the forms, begin shading:</p>

<ul>

<li>Identify where the light hits and where shadows fall.  </li>

<li>Use <strong>soft edges</strong> for more rounded zones, like the cheeks or top of the forehead.  </li>

<li>Use <strong>firmer edges</strong> where planes turn more suddenly, like the nose bridge or jawline.  </li>

<li>Remember that each blob can overlap neighboring blobs and cast shadows.</li>

</ul>

<p>It’s not about copying the exact reference. Instead, use the reference to guide how you imagine each form turning in space.</p>

<h2>Bonus: Change the Light Direction</h2>

<p>When you’ve done a few studies, try keeping the same angle and blobs but <strong>invent a different light source</strong>. Ask yourself, “What happens if the light comes from below?” or “What if it comes more from the side?” You’ll have to visualize new shadow shapes and edge transitions. This helps train your mind to see forms in three dimensions, rather than just copying.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p>Blobby head drawings are an amazing way to break complex portraits into manageable forms. We learn how lights and shadows wrap around these forms, and how edges can shift from soft to firm. Practice several versions, start simple, get more detailed, then mix it up by changing the light. Focus on making each blob feel alive in 3D, and you’ll see a big improvement in your overall head drawing.</p>
