<h2>Getting Started: Deciding the Position</h2>

<p>To draw a 3D airplane, start by deciding its <strong>position</strong> in space. Is it coming toward you, moving away, or flying at an angle? Establish the airplane's orientation to plan your drawing effectively.</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Aspect Line</strong>: Begin with an aspect line to indicate the direction the airplane is facing.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Starting with Blobs</h2>

<p>Begin with simple <strong>blobs</strong> to represent the main parts of the airplane. Blobs are rough curves that don't require precision, making them easy to work with initially.</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Fuselage</strong>: Draw a blob for the body of the airplane.</li>

<li><strong>Rubber Band Technique</strong>: Envision a rubber band wrapping around the blob to understand its three-dimensional form.</li>

<li><strong>Directional Lines</strong>: Indicate which parts of the blob are closer to you and which are farther away.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Adding Wings and Tail</h2>

<p>Next, add blobs or simple shapes to represent the <strong>wings</strong> and <strong>tail</strong>.</p>

<ul>

<li>

<p><strong>Wings</strong>:</p>

<ul>

<li>Determine the <strong>axes</strong> on which the wings will be placed.</li>

<li>Draw wings extending from the fuselage, considering their orientation in space.</li>

<li>Ensure that the wing closer to you appears larger due to <strong>perspective</strong>.</li>

</ul>

</li>

<li>

<p><strong>Tail</strong>:</p>

<ul>

<li>Place the tail at the rear of the fuselage.</li>

<li>Consider the <strong>line system</strong> it follows in space.</li>

</ul>

</li>

</ul>

<h2>Understanding Axes and Perspective</h2>

<p>Understanding the <strong>three main directions</strong> in perspective is crucial.</p>

<ul>

<li>

<p><strong>Three Axes</strong>:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>X-axis (Width)</strong>: Left to right.</li>

<li><strong>Y-axis (Height)</strong>: Up and down.</li>

<li><strong>Z-axis (Depth)</strong>: Forward and backward.</li>

</ul>

</li>

<li>

<p><strong>Constructing a Box</strong>:</p>

<ul>

<li>Envision a <strong>box</strong> around the fuselage.</li>

<li>The box helps establish <strong>right angles</strong> and guides your perspective.</li>

<li>It allows you to find all relevant lines for proper alignment.</li>

</ul>

</li>

</ul>

<h3>Aligning the Wings and Tail</h3>

<p>Use the box to determine where the wings and tail attach to the fuselage.</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Line Systems</strong>: The wings follow the line systems established by the box's edges.</li>

<li><strong>Axes Alignment</strong>: Ensure each part aligns with the correct axis.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Refining with Blocks</h2>

<p>Now, refine your blobs into precise <strong>blocks</strong>.</p>

<ul>

<li>

<p><strong>Fuselage</strong>:</p>

<ul>

<li>Transform the fuselage blob into a block to represent its volume more accurately.</li>

</ul>

</li>

<li>

<p><strong>Wings and Tail</strong>:</p>

<ul>

<li>Refine the wings and tail into blocks, following the established axes.</li>

<li>Use <strong>straight lines</strong> to define edges and planes.</li>

</ul>

</li>

</ul>

<h3>Dividing the Fuselage</h3>

<ul>

<li>

<p><strong>Divide the fuselage into thirds</strong>:</p>

<ul>

<li>The front third, middle third, and rear third.</li>

<li>The wings usually attach at the <strong>middle third</strong>.</li>

</ul>

</li>

<li>

<p><strong>Proportions</strong>:</p>

<ul>

<li>Be mindful of the proportions of each section.</li>

<li>Use measuring techniques to ensure accuracy.</li>

</ul>

</li>

</ul>

<h2>Tapering Wings and Tail</h2>

<p>Add realism by <strong>tapering</strong> the wings and tail.</p>

<ul>

<li>

<p><strong>Wings</strong>:</p>

<ul>

<li>From the wing roots at the fuselage, draw lines to the wing tips to create a taper.</li>

<li>Use lines connecting corresponding points to ensure symmetry.</li>

</ul>

</li>

<li>

<p><strong>Tail</strong>:</p>

<ul>

<li>Taper the tail fin by drawing lines from the base to the top.</li>

<li>Apply the same principles as with the wings.</li>

</ul>

</li>

</ul>

<h2>Drawing Different Perspectives</h2>

<p>Practice drawing the airplane from various angles to understand how perspective affects the drawing.</p>

<h3>Looking Up at the Airplane</h3>

<ul>

<li>

<p><strong>Lines Recede Downward</strong>:</p>

<ul>

<li>When looking up, lines recede <strong>downward</strong> as they go away from you.</li>

</ul>

</li>

<li>

<p><strong>Underside Visibility</strong>:</p>

<ul>

<li>The <strong>underside</strong> of the wings and fuselage are visible.</li>

</ul>

</li>

</ul>

<h3>Looking Down at the Airplane</h3>

<ul>

<li>

<p><strong>Lines Recede Upward</strong>:</p>

<ul>

<li>When looking down, lines recede <strong>upward</strong> as they go away from you.</li>

</ul>

</li>

<li>

<p><strong>Top Surfaces Visibility</strong>:</p>

<ul>

<li>The <strong>top</strong> surfaces of the wings and fuselage are visible.</li>

</ul>

</li>

</ul>

<h3>Airplane Coming Toward You</h3>

<ul>

<li>

<p><strong>Foreshortening</strong>:</p>

<ul>

<li>The front of the airplane appears larger due to foreshortening.</li>

<li>The fuselage may seem more compressed.</li>

</ul>

</li>

<li>

<p><strong>Square Front</strong>:</p>

<ul>

<li>The front may appear almost square, with the body more foreshortened.</li>

</ul>

</li>

</ul>

<h3>Airplane Going Away from You</h3>

<ul>

<li>

<p><strong>Tail Visibility</strong>:</p>

<ul>

<li>The tail appears larger relative to the rest of the airplane.</li>

<li>Be aware of how lines recede into the distance.</li>

</ul>

</li>

</ul>

<h2>Using Three Sets of Line Directions</h2>

<p>Understanding the <strong>three sets of line directions</strong> simplifies perspective drawing.</p>

<ul>

<li>

<p><strong>Line Sets</strong>:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Lines going up as they recede</strong>.</li>

<li><strong>Lines going down to the right as they recede</strong>.</li>

<li><strong>Lines going down to the left as they recede</strong>.</li>

</ul>

</li>

<li>

<p>Use these directions to maintain correct perspective and ensure all elements align properly.</p>

</li>

</ul>

<h3>Maxim: "Looking Up, Lines Go Down"</h3>

<ul>

<li>When looking up at an object, the lines recede <strong>downward</strong>.</li>

<li>This helps predict where lines should go in your drawing.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Seeing Through the Forms</h2>

<ul>

<li>

<p><strong>Draw Through</strong>:</p>

<ul>

<li>Lightly sketch the hidden lines to understand how parts connect.</li>

<li>This x-ray vision technique helps maintain structural accuracy.</li>

</ul>

</li>

<li>

<p><strong>Navigating Wires</strong>:</p>

<ul>

<li>Use straight lines as guides to find positions and connections.</li>

<li>Always use straight lines to locate positions, even when dealing with complex forms.</li>

</ul>

</li>

</ul>

<h2>From Blobs to Refined Curves</h2>

<ul>

<li>Begin with <strong>rough curves</strong> (blobs) because they're easy.</li>

<li>Move to <strong>specific blocks</strong> for more precise positions.</li>

<li>Advance to <strong>refined curves</strong> for detailed and realistic shapes.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Refinements and Subtleties</h3>

<ul>

<li>

<p><strong>Complex Forms</strong>:</p>

<ul>

<li>Propeller blades, domes, spheres, gears, and other curved surfaces require advanced techniques.</li>

</ul>

</li>

<li>

<p><strong>Dividing Curves</strong>:</p>

<ul>

<li>Use blocks and right-angled lines to ensure curves are accurate.</li>

<li>Refined curves are more challenging but add sophistication to your drawing.</li>

</ul>

</li>

</ul>

<h2>Practice and Repetition</h2>

<ul>

<li>

<p><strong>Repeat the Process</strong>:</p>

<ul>

<li>Draw the airplane multiple times, refining your technique with each iteration.</li>

</ul>

</li>

<li>

<p><strong>Patience</strong>:</p>

<ul>

<li>Mastery comes with practice and understanding.</li>

<li>Don't rush the learning process, take time to build solid foundations.</li>

</ul>

</li>

</ul>

<h2>Moving Forward</h2>

<p>In future lessons, you'll dive deeper into the <strong>technical foundations</strong> of form and space:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Orthos</strong></li>

<li><strong>Axes</strong></li>

<li><strong>Eye Levels</strong></li>

<li><strong>Picture Planes</strong></li>

</ul>

<p>These concepts will enhance your ability to draw objects in any position and create more complex and detailed drawings.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p>By starting with simple shapes and gradually refining them, you can draw a 3D airplane from any angle. Understanding perspective, axes, and form allows you to invent and create complex objects confidently. Keep practicing, and over time, your drawings will become more precise and realistic.</p>
