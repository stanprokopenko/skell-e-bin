<h2>What's in Premium?</h2>

<p>In this lesson, we'll focus on <strong>embracing gesture and rhythm</strong> in your figure drawings. We'll start by getting our hands <strong>limber</strong> to draw <strong>gestural limbs</strong>, building on the <strong>muscle memory</strong> you've developed. You'll learn how to <strong>simplify complex forms</strong> using <strong>mnemonics</strong> like thinking of the rib cage as a <strong>tube with an egg around it</strong> or the pelvis as a <strong>Liberty Bell</strong>.</p>

<p>We'll emphasize capturing the <strong>flow and gesture</strong> over mechanical structure, keeping your lines <strong>long, light, and loose</strong>. Understanding where the body <strong>pinches</strong> and <strong>stretches</strong> in different poses adds life to your drawings. You'll practice using the <strong>underhand grip</strong> to create <strong>expressive marks</strong> and achieve fluidity in your lines.</p>

<p>The lesson also explores incorporating <strong>story and emotion</strong> into your figures, making your drawings more engaging. We'll reflect on lessons from art history, drawing inspiration from great artists. Above all, we'll focus on <strong>simplicity</strong>, removing unnecessary details to convey the essence of the figure. Through experimentation and practice, you'll enjoy the journey of improving your figure drawing skills.</p>
