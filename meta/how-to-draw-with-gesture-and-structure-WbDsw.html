<h2>Why These Two Ideas Matter</h2>

<p>I rely on two critical ideas whenever I start a drawing: <strong>gesture</strong> and <strong>structure</strong>. If we don’t anchor our process in these, we can end up merely copying reality without true control. That makes us vulnerable to getting stuck without a clear path to correct or adjust. This foundational approach supports everything from beginner exercises to advanced renderings. It helps us see like an artist and allows us to evolve our work to an even higher level if we’re already experienced.</p>

<h2>The Demonstration Process</h2>

<p>I use a <strong>two-step</strong> approach, switching back and forth between gesture and structure. In practice, I can start anywhere such as head, torso, or limbs, and build outward,</p>

<ol>

<li><strong>Gesture</strong>: I begin by drawing a long axis curve to capture the flow of a form. The gesture is about feeling the movement or “spine” of what I’m drawing.  </li>

<li><strong>Structure</strong>: Next, I simplify the form into basic shapes, such as tubes, boxes, eggs, or teardrops. These give me three-dimensional clarity, and help me see how pieces connect to each other.</li>

</ol>

<p>Because I’m working lightly, I can place multiple lines or “guesses” as I sort through my ideas. Later, I refine and darken the lines that best reflect what I want to say about the pose.</p>

<h3>Head and Neck</h3>

<p>I often start by drawing the <strong>long axis curve</strong> of the head, then place a simple shape, something like a box, sphere, or any characteristic form that suggests the angle I want. For the neck, I connect it from the jaw and ear, and follow the sternocleidomastoid muscle down to the pit of the neck. Consistency is key, I want a <strong>true</strong> connection that sets me up to place the torso accurately.</p>

<h3>Torso and Arms</h3>

<p>From the pit of the neck, I imagine the <strong>Coke bottle shape</strong> of the rib cage, or a tube-like form. I might include landmarks such as collarbones or the shrugging muscle (trapezius), to check my proportions and angles. If something isn’t ringing true, I <strong>add more structure</strong> to clarify. I incorporate the shoulders and arms in similarly simplified, characteristic forms, often using bullet-shaped or egg-shaped structures to show how the muscles and bones flow from one shape into the next.</p>

<h3>Pelvis and Legs</h3>

<p>Lower on the figure, I treat the waist and pelvis as a <strong>beanbag</strong> or egg shape, then attach the legs with more tubes and egg-shaped forms. Sometimes I see the upper leg as a combination of a tube and an egg or “drumstick” shape. I draw the <strong>long fluid curves</strong> on the exterior and note any corners that occur where the forms bend or meet. If proportions look off, I erase, redraw, or modify the length or thickness. My goal is for all parts to look connected and believable, even if I choose to stylize.</p>

<h2>Balancing What I See and What I Want</h2>

<p>I’m always trying to capture both what I <strong>observe</strong> and what I <strong>wish to emphasize</strong>. If I want a heroic proportion, I might enlarge the torso or extend the legs beyond what I see in a reference. The question is whether it rings true for my artistic purpose. Simple shapes remain my guide, but I’ll refine details if something feels too crude or out of place.</p>

<h2>Looking Ahead</h2>

<p>From this combination of gesture and structure, I can progress to more refined work, even into tonal rendering and exploring “box logic” to further define forms. Next, I plan to dive deeper into <strong>filters and iterations</strong>, which is my “secret sauce” for leveling up your skill. Understanding how to methodically improve each stage of your drawing helps you go from wherever you are now to wherever you want to be. I’ll also touch on how deep practice can make you even more efficient at learning and perfecting these foundational skills.</p>

<p>That’s the overview of my approach. I hope this helps clarify <strong>why</strong> gesture and structure are so critical, and how to start applying them in your own drawings. They’re the key for building any pose, solidly and creatively.</p>
