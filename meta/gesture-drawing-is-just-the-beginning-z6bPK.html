<h2>Be Kind to Yourself</h2>

<p>Congratulations on completing the gesture drawing course. The most important thing to take away is to <strong>be kind to yourself</strong>. Gesture drawing is really challenging, and you've been given a lot of information, big terms, big ideas, and multiple techniques. <strong>It takes a long time to feel confident</strong> and strong in gesture drawing, so <strong>be patient</strong> and enjoy the time you're spending on it.</p>

<p>Reward yourself for little victories and wins. Remember, <strong>this is a marathon</strong>. Even after 20 years of practice, I still make mistakes all the time. <strong>Self-forgiveness</strong> is essential, and it's something I wish someone had shared with me more often.</p>

<h2>Keep Moving Forward</h2>

<p>Don't worry about mastering this right away. Many students get stuck on just doing gesture when you have to <strong>keep going</strong>. <strong>Gesture is just the start of a drawing</strong>. If you're like me and want to finish one thing before moving on to the next, you might have to adjust your mindset. Sometimes, you'll learn ways to make your gesture better when you move on to the next stage.</p>

<p>You might find that you need to do less gesture because you're good enough at indicating the figure's position for the skeleton to go on top. It's always about the <strong>setup</strong>. There's no reason to linger forever on the gesture. <strong>You have to move on</strong> and develop your drawing to make improvements.</p>

<p>Always consider the gesture in the bigger context of your process.</p>

<h2>Return and Reflect</h2>

<p>If you'd like to return to this course, it's always a fantastic idea. I often retake and rewatch things that I didn't get a whole lot from the first time, and then take away a whole bunch the second time. I recommend returning to it later, in a few months or in a year. You'll gain something significant and different the second time around.</p>

<p>Use this course as a way to <strong>advance and develop your own process</strong>. When you're feeling in a lull or have an opportunity to include some new information, revisiting these lessons can be incredibly beneficial.</p>
