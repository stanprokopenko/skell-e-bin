<p>Hello everyone,</p>

<p>We're diving into the <strong>Designing Value Groups</strong> project today. I want to start by saying how impressed I am with your submissions. You all are making fantastic progress, and it's evident in the quality of your drawings. Let's jump in and see where we can make further improvements.</p>

<h2>Understanding Value Relationships</h2>

<p>One common issue I've noticed is not making the shadows dark enough, which leaves little room to develop the lights. It's all about the relationships between values. If your shadows are too light, your lights won't pop, and the drawing loses contrast.</p>

<h3>Making Shadows Dark Enough</h3>

<p>For instance, Gwen mentioned that she didn't make the values on the face dark enough, which didn't leave much room in the lights. She's absolutely correct. If the shadows on the face are too light compared to the background, it becomes challenging to keep all your halftones lighter than the shadows. You have to be super subtle, but it's much easier and more effective to create a stronger contrast between shadows and lights.</p>

<h3>Overlapping Lines and Distracting Textures</h3>

<p>Another point is about overlapping lines creating darker areas unintentionally. These overlaps can be distracting, especially if they don't contribute to the form. They can seem like two-dimensional patterns rather than indicating structure. Control the variety in your values to avoid accidental emphasis on unimportant areas.</p>

<h2>Importance of Contrast</h2>

<p>Contrast is crucial in guiding the viewer's eye to the focal points of your drawing.</p>

<h3>Contrast Between Shadows and Lights</h3>

<p>Creating a strong contrast between shadows and lights makes your drawing more dynamic. For example, in Gwen's fourth attempt, increasing the contrast in the focal points would enhance the drawing. If thereâ€™s too much contrast in non-focal areas, like clothing, it can distract from the face.</p>

<h3>Avoiding Too Much Contrast in Non-Focal Areas</h3>

<p>Be mindful of where you place your highest contrasts. If the brightest brights and darkest darks are in areas like the clothing, they might steal attention from the face. It's often better to tone down these areas to keep the focus where you want it.</p>

<h2>Organizing Shapes and Values</h2>

<p>Starting with big shapes and connecting shadows can simplify your drawing process and lead to a more cohesive piece.</p>

<h3>Starting with Big Shadow Masses</h3>

<p>Think of grouping your shadows into large "oceans" rather than scattered "floaters." By connecting shadows into bigger shapes, you create a stronger structure. This approach makes it easier to manage values and helps the drawing read more clearly.</p>

<h3>Avoiding Floaters</h3>

<p>Floaters are small, unconnected shapes that can be distracting. They often occur when shadows or highlights are isolated without any connection to the larger value masses. Try to minimize these by connecting shapes whenever possible.</p>

<h3>Connecting Shadows and Lights</h3>

<p>Use halftones to bridge between your lights and shadows. By carefully designing the shapes and transitions, you can guide the viewer's eye and enhance the three-dimensional effect.</p>

<h2>Simplifying Shapes</h2>

<p>Designing your shapes with intention can greatly improve the readability of your drawing.</p>

<h3>Straight Lines vs. Curvy Lines</h3>

<p>While organic, curvy lines have their place, incorporating straight lines can add structure and strength to your drawing. Straight lines help define planes and angles, making the forms more solid and believable.</p>

<h3>Contained vs. Uncontained Shapes</h3>

<p><strong>Contained shapes</strong> have clear, defined edges and contribute to the overall design cohesively. <strong>Uncontained shapes</strong> lack clear boundaries and can make the drawing look messy or unfinished. Aim to create well-contained shapes, especially in areas of importance.</p>

<h2>Using Value Tools Wisely</h2>

<p>Tools like the Proko Value Tool can be helpful but use them thoughtfully.</p>

<h3>The Proko Value Tool</h3>

<p>The Value Tool can assist in simplifying values and understanding relationships. However, be cautious with the simplicity slider.</p>

<h3>Avoiding Over-Simplification</h3>

<p>Cranking up the simplicity too much can "melt" the shapes together, losing essential details and structure. This over-simplification can make your drawings look elementary. Keep some of the fidelity and only simplify to the point where it enhances the drawing without sacrificing important information.</p>

<h2>Managing Contrast and Value Range</h2>

<p>Understanding how to use your full value range can make your drawings more dynamic.</p>

<h3>Ensuring Enough Contrast</h3>

<p>If you find you're struggling to develop three light tones, it might be because your shadows aren't dark enough. Don't be afraid to make your shadows sufficiently dark to allow room for lighter values in the lights.</p>

<h3>Avoiding Too Much Contrast Within Shadows</h3>

<p>While contrast is good, too much contrast within the shadows can break the unity of the shadow family. Keep the values within the shadows closer together to maintain cohesion.</p>

<h2>Focusing on Proportions and Structure</h2>

<p>Accurate proportions and underlying structure are foundational to a successful drawing.</p>

<h3>Checking Proportions</h3>

<p>Pay close attention to the overall shape of the head and the placement of features. Starting with an incorrect basic shape makes it difficult to place features accurately.</p>

<h3>Incorporating Structure</h3>

<p>Even in stylized or simplified drawings, suggesting the underlying planes and structure adds solidity. Use straight lines and defined angles to hint at the form beneath the surface.</p>

<h2>Embracing the Learning Process</h2>

<p>Remember, this is all part of the learning process. It's okay to make mistakes, what's important is recognizing them and learning from them.</p>

<h3>Practice and Patience</h3>

<p>Skills like accurate value grouping and shape design take time to develop. Keep practicing, and don't be too hard on yourself. Each drawing is an opportunity to improve.</p>

<h3>Looking Forward to Edges</h3>

<p>We'll be focusing on edges in upcoming lessons, which will further enhance your drawings. Stay tuned, and keep up the great work!</p>

<p>I'm proud of the progress you're all making. Keep experimenting, learning, and pushing your boundaries. See you next time as we dive into edges!</p>
