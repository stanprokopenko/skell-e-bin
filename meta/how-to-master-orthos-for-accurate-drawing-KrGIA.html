<p>If you want to <strong>understand an object enough to draw it in perspective</strong>, you need to understand it <strong>out of perspective</strong>. That's where <strong>orthographic views</strong>, or <strong>orthos</strong>, come into play.</p>

<h2>What Are Orthos?</h2>

<p><strong>Orthos are straight-on views</strong> that give you absolute measurements, but only on two axes at a time. They reduce the complexity of an object by focusing on two dimensions per view. This makes it easier to grasp the object's true proportions without the distortion of perspective.</p>

<h3>The Three Main Orthographic Views</h3>

<ol>

<li><strong>Front View</strong>: Shows <strong>left-right (X-axis)</strong> and <strong>up-down (Y-axis)</strong>.</li>

<li><strong>Top View</strong>: Shows <strong>left-right (X-axis)</strong> and <strong>front-back (Z-axis)</strong>.</li>

<li><strong>Side View</strong>: Shows <strong>up-down (Y-axis)</strong> and <strong>front-back (Z-axis)</strong>.</li>

</ol>

<p>No matter how complex the object, <strong>orthos line up</strong> as you swivel from top to front or front to side. This alignment helps you understand how different views correspond to each other.</p>

<h2>The Importance of Multiple Views</h2>

<p>Even a simple object has more information than a single view can provide. For complex objects like a hand, you may need up to <strong>six views</strong> - front, back, top, bottom, and each side, because each perspective reveals different details.</p>

<p>A single ortho view doesn't tell you everything. For example, if an object recesses or projects, the <strong>front view</strong> won't show the receding or projecting lines. They go straight back, not to a vanishing point, but straight into the paper.</p>

<h2>Orthos vs. Perspective</h2>

<p>In orthos, <strong>there is no diminishing in size</strong> as things go away from you. <strong>No vanishing points.</strong> Lines that recede or advance do not converge. This is different from <strong>oblique views</strong> or perspectives, where receding lines go to vanishing points.</p>

<h3>Why This Matters</h3>

<p>Without orthos, you might misunderstand forms when you try to draw them in perspective. As Robert Beverly Hale pointed out, figure drawing students often make the mistake of altering forms based on a limited viewpoint.</p>

<p>Even though a <strong>three-quarter view</strong> tells you more than any one ortho view, being able to draw it comes from knowing <strong>multiple ortho views</strong>. The top or side view tells you if a form goes in or presses out, information the front view doesn't provide.</p>

<h2>Aligning Your Orthos</h2>

<p>It makes sense to lay out your orthos logically:</p>

<ul>

<li>From <strong>top to front</strong></li>

<li>From <strong>front to side</strong></li>

</ul>

<p>This way, they swivel to line up correctly. This alignment doesn't work with oblique views because <strong>perspective affects the points of height</strong>. By taking them out of perspective, <strong>no horizon lines, no vanishing points, you get the unbiased truth</strong> of spatial realities, one side at a time.</p>

<h2>The Benefits of Learning Orthos</h2>

<p>Studying orthos takes concentration, but if you learn them, they will <strong>heighten your awareness of form and space</strong>, just like maps enhance your understanding of where you live. Orthos provide a foundation that makes drawing in perspective more accurate and intuitive.</p>

<h2>Your Project</h2>

<p><strong>Draw an object in at least three orthographic views.</strong> Choose something simple or complex, and apply what you've learned about front, top, and side views. Understanding these perspectives will greatly improve your ability to depict objects realistically.</p>
