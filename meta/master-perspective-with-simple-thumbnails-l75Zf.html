<h2>Thumbnailing: Starting Small Without Worry</h2>

<p>For drawings like these, I start by <strong>thumbnailing small sketches</strong>. I'm not concerned with accuracy at this stage. I make notes to remind myself of the problems I need to solve. Even when I hadn't given thought to certain angled lines, I realized later that the lines would be out there.</p>

<p>But here's the thing, <strong>nobody sees these preliminary sketches</strong>. They're like those of Leonardo da Vinci, without the grace, power, intrigue, majesty, or skill. But apart from those five things, it is exactly the same kind of thinking. Thumbnails don't need to worry about grace, power, majesty, skill, or even style. They get us started.</p>

<h2>Solving Perspective Problems</h2>

<p>Then we work it out. When we face <strong>perspective problems</strong>, we solve them in various ways. One way is with <strong>instruments</strong>. If you don't use T-squares and triangles yet, you will soon.</p>

<p>If you're already experienced with perspective, you'll watch this demo and know what I'm doing. If you're not, I'm not teaching it to you here. This comes later in the course, but if you're ambitious, I'll explain a bit as I go.</p>

<h3>Using Instruments</h3>

<p>I use a <strong>depth measuring system</strong> that finds the far corner of the next distant rectangle. By running a line from a close corner of the closer rectangle through a long center line that goes through all of the coming rectangles, we find the next corner, and the next, and the next. It's really simple to use if you have instruments that make it convenient. But remember, you can always think this way freehand, as I did here.</p>

<p>You can and will learn to do this, but I'll explain it all after you've learned a few other things. Because if you do this now before learning perspective, it's like learning to play a ditty on a musical instrument without learning music, or the instrument.</p>

<p>This may be all you need if you're just going to draw a lot of walls and fences and floor tiles, and it's all clear now. "Thanks, Marshall, no need to study further." But the way I'm demonstrating here will not solve every back-end space problem, and that's why we devote a full episode to this when you have the tools to know which systems to use when.</p>

<p>And if you run into trouble, which you will if you're creating, you'll know how to work out the trouble. This is to show you one way artists work out problems. It's too involved to worry about while thumbnailing. This is a separate stage to make a drawing or painting look right.</p>

<h2>The Importance of Foundations</h2>

<p>For example, arches have round parts at the top. And in your drawing space, and in your habits, before we get into complex perspective problems, <strong>prepare for a one-year pursuit</strong>. Most important, the things you learn early in this course, which may seem too elementary, you'll be so glad later that you stuck with the simple stuff for a long time before moving on to the complicated stuff.</p>

<p><strong>It's better to have a strong foundation in your understanding of perspective</strong> than it is to only know some tricks, as useful as the tricks are. And if you're not that committed to this, these tricks may help, maybe even from watching this demo.</p>

<h2>Observations on Perspective Elements</h2>

<p>Now some observations. Most of this is about <strong>depth measuring</strong>. It comes after you've mastered the <strong>cube</strong>. Those arches are made of round parts, which we solve with <strong>ellipses</strong>, which are the ends of <strong>cylinders</strong> that point to <strong>vanishing points</strong>. Their vanishing point doesn't need to be where I put it. We could move it around for effects, but of course, that must come after we've learned how to place vanishing points.</p>

<p>We didn't even make things stick out, which in theory isn't difficult to understand. It just has to do with pulling a line out and building around it. But when you're drawing that all out by hand, it can take a lot of time, and we're not here to make masterpieces. We're here to <strong>learn how perspective works and apply it</strong>.</p>

<p>Masterpieces often require solving problems on separate paper. And as there are stages to a drawing, there are stages to training.</p>

<h2>The Stages of Training</h2>

<p>We are at the beginning of your training. You have a job: <strong>Collect treasure</strong>. Images like those artists we've looked at and will look at again. Diagrams from books on perspective that you're eager to study. If they're not your style, see them as <strong>maps that lead to more treasure</strong>.</p>

<h3>What's Ahead</h3>

<p>Here's what's ahead:</p>

<ul>

<li>Some of it's <strong>easy and fun</strong>.</li>

<li>Some of it will take <strong>serious concentration</strong>.</li>

<li>Some of it will combine <strong>hard work and fun challenges</strong>.</li>

<li>Some of the most valuable lessons will seem like <strong>tedious repetition</strong>, but you will be glad you did them.</li>

</ul>

<p>And the hardest parts, cylinders and spheres and divisions all around, end up surprisingly easy when the cubes and the axes they're based on are deep in your habits. I'll try to vary it up for you.</p>

<h2>The Big Point: Multiple Stages</h2>

<p>Let's end on the big point. These demos were to show that <strong>perspective problems are solvable</strong> on paper with pencil and straightedge and some knowledge, and maybe even without a straightedge. Another lesson is that <strong>it doesn't usually happen all at once</strong>. Get used to <strong>multiple stages</strong>, especially in your training.</p>

<p>This may be used in a finished picture, or it may just be an exercise to rehearse the procedure so we can sketch with it loosely and freehand apart from the drawing table.</p>

<p>Remember, I didn't start here. <strong>I started with these little drawings that nobody sees</strong>. Thumbnailing allows us to start without worry.</p>

<p>In our next set of lessons, we'll talk more about <strong>process</strong>.</p>

<p>We got power.</p>
