<h2>What's in Premium?</h2>

<p>In this lesson, we focus on developing your hand skills to match your brain skills. You'll review essential materials—pencils, papers, T-squares, and triangles—and practice by drawing optical illusions. Using grid paper, you'll redraw these illusions freehand.</p>

<p>You'll take on challenges like drawing circles with a compass, bisecting them with horizontal and vertical lines, and freehanding lines at all angles without rotating your sketchbook. You'll also bisect quadrants by drawing 45-degree angles. Consistent practice will help you gain control of your lines and move from theory to practice.</p>
