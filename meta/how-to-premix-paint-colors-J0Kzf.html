<p><strong>Pre-Mixing Colors</strong></p>

<p>Pre-mixing colors before you start painting offers several benefits. It helps you avoid frequent mixing discussions during the painting process, allowing you to focus more on the art itself. To keep your paint mixtures from drying out, use small cups from a dollar store. Label these cups to avoid any confusion about their contents.</p>

<p><strong>Mixing Strategy</strong></p>

<p>When pre-mixing, aim to create an average light, average dark, half tone, and possibly a dark half tone or reflected light for shadows. This strategy is particularly useful for large paintings, where maintaining consistent colors, such as for a subject's dress, is crucial.</p>

<p><strong>Understanding Local Color</strong></p>

<p>Local color refers to the inherent color of an object, like a red apple. However, when mixing, focus on the average color affected by light, not just the local color. This approach helps in achieving a more realistic representation in your painting.</p>

<p><strong>Limited Palette</strong></p>

<p>Using a limited palette can yield beautiful results. You can work with alizarin crimson, yellow ocher, pale black, and white. Even without pure colors, a subdued palette can be effective in creating the desired effect.</p>

<p><strong>Creating Flesh Tones</strong></p>

<p>To create an average flesh tone, balance the highlights and shadows. The average color should not be as light as the highlights or as dark as the shadows. Limited color choices simplify decision-making during mixing.</p>

<p><strong>Mixing Process</strong></p>

<p>Start with yellow ocher and alizarin crimson, then adjust with white and black to achieve the desired tone. Avoid complex color theory, rely on trial and error to find the right mix. The goal is to achieve a grayer skin tone, not high chroma.</p>

<p><strong>Balancing Warm and Cool Colors</strong></p>

<p>Balancing warm and cool colors is crucial. Use black to gray down mixtures, as it is a cold color. Adjust the amount of alizarin to add warmth to shadows, counteracting the coolness of black. Yellow ocher is preferred over white for lightening mixtures without cooling them down too much.</p>

<p><strong>Importance of Values</strong></p>

<p>Focus on the value of colors, which refers to their lightness or darkness, rather than the color itself. Teach beginners to understand values and create form through light and values, rather than just focusing on color.</p>

<p><strong>Iterative Mixing Process</strong></p>

<p>The mixing process is iterative. Adjust mixtures iteratively for consistency and compare light and dark mixtures to ensure they relate well to each other. Test and refine your mixtures before finalizing them to achieve a good average that matches the subject's skin color.</p>

<p><strong>Practical Tips</strong></p>

<p>Use yellow ocher pale for lightening without cooling down the mixture. Ensure shadows are not too cool or dark to avoid making the subject look lifeless. Emphasize experimentation as a learning tool, as theories and techniques may make more sense after completing a painting.</p>
