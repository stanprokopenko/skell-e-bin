<p>In this lesson, you'll learn how to <strong>embrace foreshortening</strong> by using simple forms like blocks and arrows. Foreshortening can be challenging, but by starting with basic shapes, you can build confidence and improve your ability to draw complex, three-dimensional objects.</p>

<h2>Understanding Orthographic Views</h2>

<p><strong>Orthographic views</strong> (<strong>orthos</strong>) are front and back views of an object. They provide the <strong>drafting information</strong> needed to understand the object's dimensions. For example, when drawing an arrow, you can use front and back orthos to grasp its proportions.</p>

<h2>Using Simple Forms to Understand Complex Forms</h2>

<p>To make complex forms manageable, fit them into simple shapes like boxes. An arrow, though not very complex, can be packed into a box to simplify its form. By drawing the arrow within a box, you can <strong>tip it around</strong> and practice foreshortening.</p>

<h2>Embracing Foreshortening</h2>

<p>Foreshortening involves depicting an object or part of it as closer than it is, creating an illusion of depth. As the master <strong>Kim Jung Gi</strong> says, "The way to foreshorten a complex form is to pack it into a simple form."</p>

<h3>Drawing Transparent Forms</h3>

<p>When drawing the box and the arrow inside it, <strong>draw it as transparent</strong>. Whisper the lines on the other side, these lines are important as they help you understand the full form.</p>

<h3>Using Scaffolding and Extrusion</h3>

<p>Use <strong>scaffolding</strong> to establish the structure. <strong>Scribe onto a face plane</strong> where you want the arrow. Knowing the distance to the other side allows you to <strong>extrude</strong> the arrow into the box, projecting it into thickness.</p>

<h3>Connecting Dots to Complete the Form</h3>

<p>Find every point by using <strong>X, Y, or Z lines</strong> to locate mystery dots inside the borders. <strong>Connect the dots</strong> to complete the foreshortened form. This method helps you understand how to foreshorten any object.</p>

<h2>Practicing Foreshortening</h2>

<h3>Daring to Foreshorten</h3>

<p>It takes courage to <strong>dare to foreshorten</strong>. When you know an object's length, compressing it into a foreshortened plane can be challenging. But by practicing, you'll become more comfortable with foreshortening.</p>

<h3>Curved vs. Blocky Objects</h3>

<p>With <strong>round objects</strong>, like a pumpkin, as they curve away, they <strong>gradually foreshorten</strong>, and details pack gradually at the edges. However, with <strong>blocky objects</strong>, the foreshortening happens <strong>abruptly</strong> on certain planes.</p>

<h2>Observing Foreshortening in Different Axes</h2>

<h3>The Z-Axis Foreshortening</h3>

<p>On the <strong>Z-axis</strong>, planes can be <strong>very foreshortened</strong>. Recognizing which planes are foreshortened helps you understand the object's dimensions.</p>

<h3>The X-Axis and Height</h3>

<p>On the <strong>X-axis</strong>, planes may be <strong>barely foreshortened</strong>. The <strong>height axis</strong> often remains at <strong>full measure</strong>, especially when not viewed from extreme angles.</p>

<h3>Comparing to Orthographic Views</h3>

<p>Comparing your drawing to the <strong>orthographic views</strong> helps you see which sides are shortened and which are not. This comparison is essential for accurate foreshortening.</p>

<h2>Applying Foreshortening to Anatomy</h2>

<p>This approach applies to learning anatomy. By comparing side, front, and back views, you can see how limbs <strong>foreshorten</strong>. Note that photographs may have distortions due to lenses, but drawing allows you to understand and play with foreshortening.</p>

<h2>Dealing with Diagonals and Vectors</h2>

<h3>Understanding Diagonals in Complex Forms</h3>

<p>Complex forms often have diagonals. <strong>Boxes</strong> have right angles and lines on the X, Y, and Z axes. <strong>Arrows</strong>, however, have angles that can't be labeled so simply.</p>

<h3>Naming Vectors</h3>

<p>When a line moves forward on Z and inward on X, it's an <strong>X-Z vector</strong>. For example, the arrowhead moves into the center on X as it moves forward on Z. If a line moves back and up, as on an airplane's tail, it's a <strong>Y-Z vector</strong>.</p>

<h3>The Complexity of Three-Dimensional Movement</h3>

<p>Some lines move on all three axes, moving back, in, and up or down. These are challenging to grasp, but being aware of them is the first step. You'll master these complex movements as you progress.</p>

<h2>Starting Simple Before Complicating with Diagonals</h2>

<p>Begin with <strong>simple right-angled analyses</strong> of objects. It's okay if the proportions are off, the goal is to understand the object in simple axes before introducing diagonals. You don't need to name each axis when you can think in terms of blocks and carving into them.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p>Give yourself time to <strong>practice foreshortening</strong>. Start simple, do several orthos, <strong>as many as a dozen</strong>, and get comfortable with this way of thinking. By daring to foreshorten, you'll overcome fear and explore fearlessly in 3D. Remember, complications like diagonals are part of creating complex forms. With practice, you'll understand and utilize them effectively.</p>
