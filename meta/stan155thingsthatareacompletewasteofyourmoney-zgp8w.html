<h2>1. Bulk Purchases</h2>

<p>Buying in bulk can seem like a great way to save money, but it might not always be the best choice. I used to buy everything from Costco because I was saving a few cents per ounce. However, living in an apartment with my girlfriend, I kept forgetting that we can't eat for a family of five. The issue with buying in bulk is that things expire, and it isn't worth forcing yourself to finish everything before the expiration date. For perishable items like veggies, snacks, and meats, I now buy them in regular sizes from the supermarket.</p>

<h2>2. Not Knowing the Best Saving Strategy</h2>

<p>In the book <strong>"The Psychology of Money,"</strong> Morgan Housel says that building wealth has little to do with your income or investments and lots to do with your <strong>savings rate</strong>. Wealth is just your leftover money after you spend what you take in. You can build wealth with a high income, but you can't without a high savings rate.</p>

<p>The problem is most people don't know how to actually <strong>save</strong>, and it's something I struggled with too when I first got into personal finance. I didn't grow up with money and had zero financial knowledge. What really changed my financial trajectory was joining a savings challenge where I was held accountable and had an actual savings roadmap to follow.</p>

<h2>3. Spending Without Intention</h2>

<p>This is something I've done more often than I'd like to admit. Stores like Target and Walmart are designed to tempt you to spend more. They make their carts bigger to encourage you to add more items, and they use scents like freshly baked bread to make you hungrier. For example, Costco places their $5 rotisserie chicken at the back of the store, so you have to pass through all the aisles, food samples, and deals to get to it. By the time you reach the chicken, you might have picked up additional items, turning your $5 chicken run into a much larger expense.</p>

<p>Nowadays, before I go into any store, I get <strong>very intentional</strong> with my shopping. I write down a list of items to buy in my notes app and stick to that list. This way, I've already committed to my spending before any external factors can tempt me.</p>

<h2>4. Designer Glasses and Sunglasses</h2>

<p>In the 1950s, Ray-Bans cost less than $15 a pair, but now some of their glasses cost more than an Apple Watch. The company <strong>Luxottica</strong> controls up to <strong>80% of all major glasses brands</strong> in the world, from luxury designer brands to the $15 pairs you see at Target. Since they control so much of the market, they set the prices. What's interesting is that over <strong>70% of their products</strong>, regardless of the brand, are made in the <strong>same factory</strong> using the <strong>same materials</strong>. This means the quality is the same, and you're just paying for the logo. At the end of the day, glasses are just a piece of plastic, some metal, and glass.</p>

<h2>5. Not Following the "Love It or Leave It" Strategy</h2>

<p>This is something I've been religiously doing for about a decade now. Since I didn't have a lot growing up, when I got my first real job, I went shopping every other weekend because I finally could. Not surprisingly, I always saw things that I liked, so I bought them: H&amp;M shirts, Forever 21 sweaters, Dollar Tree pants. The problem was I ended up with a lot of things that I only wore once and then tossed in my closet.</p>

<p>But now, with the <strong>"Love It or Leave It"</strong> strategy, I only buy things that I <strong>love</strong>, not just like. This forces me to be more picky when I go shopping. Sure, I might spend more money on each item, but the higher price tag balances out because I rarely find stuff that I love. Forcing myself to have this higher threshold before I pull the trigger makes me focus more on <strong>quality than quantity</strong>. Plus, I also save more time because I have fewer things to choose from, and I wear each item a lot more.</p>

<h2>6. Not Buying Generic Medicine</h2>

<p>This is something I learned only recently, and it's already saved me thousands of dollars. Every spring, I get really bad allergies. The only thing that gave me some relief was Claritin, which costs like $20 to $30 for a 10-day supply. But I recently learned from my doctor friend that I could pay up to <strong>85% less</strong> by buying the <strong>generic version</strong>.</p>

<p>According to the FDA, generic drugs are legally required to have the <strong>same quality and performance standards</strong> as their brand-name counterparts. This includes having the same active ingredients and strength. I think the only reason we believe branded medicine is better is because they invest millions in advertising and marketing, whereas generic drugs don't have that kind of budget. Because they spend less on marketing, they can pass their savings on to you in the form of lower prices.</p>

<h2>7. Overpaying for Flights Due to Dynamic Pricing</h2>

<p>If you've ever traveled, you might notice that the price of your flight or hotel can vary wildly at different times of the year. That's because of <strong>dynamic pricing</strong>, which apparently fast-food chains are using now too. One trick I've been using to get cheaper prices, even during peak season, is using a <strong>VPN</strong>.</p>

<p>A few years back, I was looking for a flight from Mexico back to the U.S., and it was pretty expensive, about $850. So I decided to try something, I used a VPN to hide my location and set it to Mexico. Guess what happened? The price for the same ticket <strong>dropped by $300</strong>, down to $550.</p>

<h2>8. Saving Money While Traveling by Using eSIMs</h2>

<p>Something that has saved me hundreds of dollars and countless hours while traveling is using an <strong>eSIM</strong>. An eSIM is basically a digital SIM card in your phone that lets you connect to the internet the second you land in another country. You don't have to worry about outrageous carrier charges, roaming fees, or finding a local SIM card, which can be a waste of time and money.</p>

<p>When I landed in Ecuador, I knew my carrier was going to charge me an arm and a leg in roaming fees. So I bought an eSIM, activated it in a few minutes, and I was connected. I could call ride service apps from the airport to avoid getting ripped off, find the best restaurants, and continue texting my friends, all while keeping my same phone number.</p>

<h2>9. Late Fees</h2>

<p>If you're not careful, you can get charged up to <strong>$41 for missing a single credit card payment</strong>. In 2019 alone, credit card companies raked in $14 billion in late fees. But there is a way to not pay them at all. As someone who's worked in finance, I can tell you that if you don't get late fees often or you've been a longtime customer with a company, there's a high chance they'll waive your late fees if you just <strong>ask</strong>.</p>

<p>The company doesn't want to risk having an unsatisfied customer and potentially losing you over a few dollars because it costs a lot more to acquire a new customer than to retain one. So just call, be polite, and ask. If they say no, thank them and hang up. Then call again. Sometimes it just takes a few tries with different customer service reps to get it waived.</p>

<h2>10. Not Knowing How to Negotiate for Big Purchases</h2>

<p>I bought my car at the <strong>lowest reported price ever</strong> based on Edmunds' sales data, and it was all because I knew how to negotiate. Most people think negotiation is about getting the price down, but that can turn the negotiation into a confrontation, which gets you nowhere fast.</p>

<p>In the book <strong>"Getting to Yes,"</strong> author Roger Fisher says you should think of negotiations like creating a <strong>win-win solution</strong> that benefits both sides. In simple terms, the best way to negotiate is to do three things:</p>

<ol>

<li><strong>Separate the people from the problem.</strong></li>

<li><strong>Focus on interests rather than positions.</strong></li>

<li><strong>Invent options for mutual gain.</strong></li>

</ol>

<p>For instance, this is how I got my car for so cheap, and you can do this with any big purchase:</p>

<ul>

<li>A week before I stepped into the dealership, I analyzed the car's market value, sales trends, and pricing. Sellers are more inclined to negotiate when your points are based on <strong>facts and data</strong> rather than emotion.</li>

<li>Then I emailed local dealerships in my area and asked if they could match the lowest sales price I found online.</li>

<li>Once someone agreed, I called another dealership to see if they could beat that price.</li>

<li>Then, and only then, did I walk into the dealership.</li>

</ul>

<p>Once you have your price and the seller isn't willing to go any lower, start thinking outside the box. Ask them what other benefits they can offer, like better financing terms, longer warranties, or free maintenance service for a few years. All of this can be just as valuable as reducing the sticker price, and it might be easier for sellers to throw in because sometimes prices are fixed by management or they need to hit a sales number.</p>

<h2>11. Buying Things on Sale</h2>

<p>In the book <strong>"Predictably Irrational,"</strong> author Dan Ariely explains how people often make irrational decisions when they see a discount sign because of the <strong>anchoring effect</strong>. In simple terms, when you see something on sale, you fixate on the original price, which makes the discounted price more attractive.</p>

<p>For instance, when you see a $1,000 mountain bike on sale for 30% off, your mind immediately thinks, 'That's an amazing deal!' I'm saving $300 based on the original $1,000 price. But the reality is, an item that costs $1,000 and is on sale for $700 isn't saving you $300, it's still <strong>costing you $700</strong>.</p>

<p>Companies know all about the anchoring effect, which is why some retailers have been found to <strong>fake discounts</strong> in sales to get you to spend. Even though an item might say it's been marked down 50% from $50 to $25, the item might only have cost $30 a week ago. They artificially inflate the original price so it appears more discounted, making you feel like you're getting a good deal.</p>

<h2>12. Shopping Online Without Getting Cashback</h2>

<p>Nowadays, whenever I buy stuff online, I always make sure I'm getting the best deal by using <strong>cashback portals</strong>. These platforms allow you to earn cashback from a bunch of different stores like Nike, Apple, Adidas, Macy's, and many more.</p>

<p>For example, last year I bought Apple AirTags directly from Apple.com. By going through a cashback portal, I earned significant cashback on my purchase. I also used my credit card that offers cashback to maximize my savings. In the end, I saved a lot of money on a brand-new pair of AirTags.</p>

<p>Now, I don't buy anything without checking for cashback opportunities first.</p>

<h2>13. Buying Souvenirs You'll Never Use</h2>

<p>This is something we're all guilty of. While on vacation, you're having a great time, enjoying great food, and then it suddenly hits you that you need to buy a souvenir to remember your experience. That's how you end up with a giant replica of King Arthur's sword that you'll never use, touch, or see again because it's tucked away in some closet.</p>

<p>So what I do instead is buy <strong>really nice magnets</strong> with the name of the city or country. They're small enough to tuck away in my carry-on, cheap enough that I can get a couple for myself, friends, and family, and they look pretty cool on the fridge. They're also great conversation starters when people come over.</p>

<h2>14. Buying Lottery Tickets</h2>

<p>I've realized that a lot of people have trouble comprehending just how tiny their odds are of winning the lottery. The chance of winning the Powerball jackpot is <strong>1 in 292 million</strong>. The chance of winning the Mega Millions top prize is <strong>1 in 302 million</strong>.</p>

<p>To put that into perspective, you have a <strong>1 in 15,300 chance of being struck by lightning</strong>. You literally have a better chance of getting hit by lightning than winning the lottery. And I don't see people out there wearing anti-lightning suits.</p>

<h2>15. Paying ATM Fees</h2>

<p>A study found that ATM fees can cost up to $5 nowadays, and that fee can quickly add up. But there is a way to avoid paying these fees, even when the ATM is outside your network. For me, the last straw was when I spent more than $50 just in Guatemala alone to withdraw cash.</p>

<p>Immediately after that, I opened up a checking account with a bank that reimburses ATM fees, and I now use that debit card to withdraw cash from ATMs. The great thing is they will <strong>reimburse you for any ATM fees</strong> you get charged, anywhere in the world. If you can't get such an account, your best bet is to look for a bank with a really large ATM network so you don't get charged a fee.</p>

<h2>15.5. Paying for Wi-Fi in Hotels</h2>

<p>I don't know when this started happening, but many hotels nowadays like Marriott, IHG, Hilton, Hyatt - they'll charge you a fee to use Wi-Fi in your own hotel room. And it's not cheap, you can expect to pay on average $22 for something I think should already be included with the price of the hotel room.</p>

<p>If you don't want to pay this junk fee, here's how you can get the hotel Wi-Fi for free. Many of these hotels have a <strong>rewards program</strong>: Marriott has Bonvoy, IHG has IHG Rewards, Hilton has Hilton Honors. If you sign up for their rewards programs, which is free, then you can use their Wi-Fi for free.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p>Even if you're trying your hardest to save money, sometimes you might not feel like you're doing enough. It's important to accept that saving isn't always easy, and you might need to adopt new strategies to improve your financial situation.</p>
