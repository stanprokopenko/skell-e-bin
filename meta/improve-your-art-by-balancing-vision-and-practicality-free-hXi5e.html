<h2>What's in Premium?</h2>

<p>In this lesson, I explore how to balance your <strong>art brain</strong> and <strong>business brain</strong> during the illustration process. I walk through adjusting an initial conceptâ€”transforming it while considering audience appeal and staying true to your artistic vision. You'll learn about managing multiple ideas, focusing your composition, and emphasizing key elements like character silhouettes and poses. This lesson demonstrates how to create illustrations that are both personally satisfying and appealing to others.</p>
