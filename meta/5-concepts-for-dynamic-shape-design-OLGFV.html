<p>In this lesson, I'm going to show you how to use a few concepts to turn boring shapes into dynamic and exciting ones.</p>

<h2>Understanding Gesture</h2>

<p>First, to understand dynamic shapes, we need to understand <strong>gesture</strong>. Gesture is the movement, the flow, and the idea of what an object is doing. It's not the line itself, but the line represents the gesture.</p>

<p>For example, if we take a fish, we can show its gesture with a single line that explains how the fish is moving, in what direction, and how much it's curving. The same gesture can be represented with different lines, as long as they capture the movement.</p>

<p>In figure drawing, the gesture describes the big movement through the body. Each part, like the neck, arms, and legs, also has its own gesture. Even individual muscles flow with the gesture. <strong>Everything has a gesture</strong>.</p>

<p>A common misconception is that gesture is always curvy or wavy, but that's not true. If we use only curves to draw people and animals, we end up with "noodle people" who lack structure. Our bones provide visible structure on the surface, indicating stability. By contrasting the moving parts with the stable, structured parts, the whole drawing feels more balanced.</p>

<h2>Concepts for Making Shapes Dynamic</h2>

<h3>Shifting Peaks</h3>

<p>Let's start with a simple, boring shape like a pill or a bloated cylinder. In this shape, the peaks of the curves are right in the middle and horizontally across from each other, creating a vertical and horizontal symmetry.</p>

<p>By <strong>shifting the peaks</strong>, we introduce subtle movement and energy into the shape. Even a small shift can add interest. The shape now feels like something inside is pushing upward in one area and downward in another, creating a diagonal contrast and reducing stability.</p>

<h3>Breaking Symmetry</h3>

<p>We can push this further by curving one side of the shape and giving the opposite curve to the other side. Now, the axis is no longer vertical, and the whole shape has a <strong>clear flow</strong>. There's more contrast between the two sides.</p>

<h3>Adding Tension</h3>

<p>To make the shape feel even more energetic, we can add <strong>tension</strong> by introducing a pinch. Instead of just curving, we create a point where the shape bends sharply. This builds up tension, making it feel like it's being bent and will spring back if released.</p>

<p>The more intense the angle, the more tension there is. If we create a sharp angle, it feels like there's even more tension in that area. This also gives the impression of forces acting on the shape, adding a sense of movement.</p>

<h3>Contrast in Size and Shape</h3>

<p>So far, we've been breaking symmetry left to right, but we can also break symmetry top to bottom. We can change the size relationships of the top and bottom and alter the shapes.</p>

<p>For example, we can introduce a straight line on one side to add <strong>structure and stability</strong>, contrasting with a larger, curved shape on the other side. This creates an asymmetrical shape with no mirroring, adding more dynamism.</p>

<h3>Shifting Peaks Up or Down</h3>

<p>We can add even more variety by shifting the peaks up or down. If we move a peak upward, it feels like a force is pushing upward. If we move it downward, it feels like something is pushing downward. This shift implies motion in different directions.</p>

<h3>Contrast of Detail</h3>

<p>Dynamic shapes often have areas of simplicity and areas of complexity. By adding more detail to a specific area, we create a <strong>focal point</strong> and draw the viewer's attention.</p>

<p>In our shape, we can exaggerate the pinch by adding more detail, like additional zigzags. This increases the complexity in that area, making it the most exciting part of the shape. If we try to balance out the complexity by adding detail elsewhere, we lose the excitement because of competing focal points.</p>

<h3>Angling Shapes</h3>

<p>Vertical and horizontal lines generally feel more stable. By <strong>angling shapes diagonally</strong>, we introduce a sense of movement and energy.</p>

<p>For example, simply angling our boring pill shape makes it more dynamic. Changing the angle adds movement and tension, making the shape feel like it's falling or moving.</p>

<h2>Balancing Shape Design and Function</h2>

<p>When applying these concepts, we need to ensure that our shapes support the function of the object we're drawing. If we push a shape too far in the direction of being interesting, it might lose its function and no longer convincingly represent what it's supposed to be.</p>

<p>Understanding anatomy helps us design shapes that are dynamic and interesting while keeping them convincing. Our forms and designs should support the function, making sure that we're still depicting a person, an arm, or whatever the subject is.</p>

<h2>Analyzing an Example</h2>

<p>Let's look at a drawing by Eliza Ivanova. There's a lot of detail, but what draws me in is the composition. It's simple but moves through the whole piece and is balanced well.</p>

<p>Focusing on the big shape she's using:</p>

<ul>

<li>On the left side, there's a flowing curve.</li>

<li>Over the head, there's a big curvy shape.</li>

<li>There's a straight line that adds a pinch point, creating tension.</li>

<li>Straight lines at the bottom add stability and structure, implying perspective and depth.</li>

<li>The shape angles at a clear diagonal, making it dynamic.</li>

<li>There's complexity and detail on one side, supporting the area of interest.</li>

<li>The hair on the right side adds activity and draws attention.</li>

<li>The left side remains simple, providing an area of rest.</li>

</ul>

<p>Eliza uses many of the concepts we've discussed, whether intentionally or not. Her shape design shows mastery by balancing variety, flow, tension, and focal points, making a non-moving subject feel exciting.</p>

<h2>Practice with Quick Studies</h2>

<p>The best way to practice designing dynamic shapes is with <strong>quick studies</strong>. Unlike focusing on accurate shapes, which can take hours, quick studies can be done in 1 to 10 minutes. Keep them simple and move on to do more.</p>

<p>In the next lesson, I'll give you a project to practice these concepts and show you how to approach it.</p>
