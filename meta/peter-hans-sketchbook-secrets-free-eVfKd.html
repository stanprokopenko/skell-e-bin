<h2>What's in Premium?</h2>

<p>In this lesson, I share my experiences with various sketchbooks, including the <strong>Dynamic Bible Sketchbook</strong> filled with lecture notes and visuals, the <strong>Midori Traveler's Journal</strong> for capturing sketches and memorabilia on the go, and <strong>accordion sketchbooks</strong> that challenge me to create flowing transitions between images. I also discuss working with <strong>large format sketchbooks</strong> for detailed scenes, the importance of observing and drawing from life, building a relationship with your materials, and the satisfaction of finishing sketchbooks. This lesson offers insights into how sketchbooks can become a tangible record of your artistic journey.</p>
