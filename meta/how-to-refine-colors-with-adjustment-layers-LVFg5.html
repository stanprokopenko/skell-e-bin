<h2>Moving into the Adjustments Stage</h2>

<p>All right, so we finished the flats. Now we're moving on to the next stage in my coloring process, which is the <strong>adjustments stage</strong>.</p>

<p>In this stage, I choose the final colors. If I had random colors in my flats, this is when I'd mess with things like <strong>adjustment layers</strong> to make <strong>holistic adjustments</strong>. I might alter certain colors or add variation, like in the greens, for example.</p>

<h2>Adjusting Colors for Depth and Atmosphere</h2>

<p>I've subtly been making adjustments as I chose the flat colors, ensuring I can <strong>read everything</strong> and that all elements are within the <strong>color space</strong> I envision for the final piece.</p>

<p>However, there are things I might look at now. For speed, I made all the buildings the same color. But in reality, I'd want the buildings closer to us to be slightly <strong>darker</strong> because of <strong>atmospheric diffusion</strong>. When you see a mountain far away, it tends to look a bit whiter due to air molecules adding a little whiteness to things. It's not super intense for this distance, but making these sorts of adjustments is what this stage is all about.</p>

<h2>Manipulating Existing Layers</h2>

<p>Similar to when I'm doing flats, I don't need to do any more masking here. It's about <strong>manipulating what I've already set up</strong>. Since everything is organized nicely, this part goes more smoothly than if it was a mishmash.</p>

<h2>Adjusting Greens and Adding Variety</h2>

<p>I'm thinking about the greens now. Having them all the same color seems fine, but I'll make some broad changes. Things closer to the viewer can be a little bit <strong>darker</strong>. I'll leave the distant ones the same.</p>

<p>I'm going to make certain plants different, especially if there's a clump of plants near each other. Adding that <strong>variety</strong> will make it feel like it's not all just one plant. I'll separate them into a separate layer once I select more elements like them.</p>

<p>Nothing conceptually crazy here with these fine-tuning adjustments. I'm just breaking down for you that this is the time I allot for these kinds of changes. Up until this point, it's fine not to be locked into anything color-wise yet. The previous stage was all about <strong>masking</strong> and getting things ready for these adjustments.</p>

<h2>Considering the Light Source</h2>

<p>At this stage, I might also start thinking about the <strong>light source</strong>. I mentioned before when doing thumbnails that I thought light would come from the left to light the face of my main character. With flats, I can start making <strong>micro decisions</strong> to account for lighting changes. When I get to shading, some of the lifting will already be done, just enough to get a sense of the bigger plan.</p>

<p>In this case, I decided to make this side of the building have a slightly brighter color on the plants.</p>

<h2>Adjusting Specific Elements</h2>

<h3>Tweaking the AC Units</h3>

<p>I'm thinking about the gray tone I've used on all the AC units. I probably want those closer to us to be <strong>darker</strong> than the ones in the background. They're right over here. I'll alpha lock the layer so I can change their color quickly.</p>

<p>I'm going to lower their <strong>brightness</strong>. That's definitely too dark. I'm looking for more <strong>separation</strong> between this bright white color and the background. They're almost the same tone as the building, which isn't working for me. So I'll find a middle ground.</p>

<p>Sometimes that middle ground includes brightening them but adding <strong>saturation</strong>. Saturation will darken the color a bit and add value to make it between the darkness of the background and the whiteness of the bunny costume. The saturation is a little high, adding warmth to the scene. So I can either change the color and keep the saturation or desaturate. I'll lean towards <strong>desaturation</strong>, which brightens it slightly and darkens it a bit.</p>

<h3>Increasing Tonal Contrast</h3>

<p>Another place where I think there could be more <strong>tonal contrast</strong> is between the legs here and the background. This reveals that there probably should be a line there, so I'll go fix that. Now that there's enough detail, it's not standing out as much.</p>

<p>I'm going to adjust this color here. It looks like I could have a completely different sidewalk color that's darker to create the contrast I'm looking for. That feels a bit better for having these elements pop out.</p>

<h3>Adjusting Skin Tones</h3>

<p>As I promised earlier, I'm going to mess with some of the <strong>skin tones</strong>. Let's try out some colors and see if we like them. The purpose, aside from adding variety, is to make our <strong>main character pop out</strong> a bit. Rather than drawing attention to the back by darkening skin tones or pushing back value, I can control what pops out most.</p>

<p>I think there's too much similarity in the colors over here. I want the leg to read more clearly and separately from these elements, so I'll tweak those too.</p>

<h2>Making Larger Adjustments with Layer Styles</h2>

<p>I think I've honed in the colors close enough for today's quick demo. I'm going to make larger adjustments to everything with <strong>flat colors</strong>, but with effects applied to the <strong>layer style</strong>.</p>

<p>I'll fill in this layer and change it to something like <strong>overlay</strong>, <strong>soft light</strong>, or <strong>hard light</strong>. I tend to prefer messing with overlay style, starting at maybe 70% opacity. With this color, I'm applying a <strong>wash of tone</strong> across everything to see if unifying things that way is appealing and helps me get closer to a more cohesive palette.</p>

<p>It'll essentially be <strong>crushing certain colors</strong> to be on the same hue as the adjustment layer. Sometimes that's helpful. Sometimes you only want it to apply to certain elements, which depends on how you've organized things. One method I use during flats includes breaking out all the character elements, making it easier to affect those things. Today, we did it by big sections of color, so we can't do it that way. But we could, for example, <strong>mask it out</strong> broadly to be the foreground versus background.</p>

<h2>Masking and Adjusting Specific Areas</h2>

<p>That's an effect that's generally helpful and doesn't take too much time. I'll do a rough job here just to show you what I mean, but you could finesse this for sure.</p>

<p>So that's roughly all we need to mask for that to be our foreground. We'll <strong>invert</strong> it and clear this out. Now, the only thing affected is the <strong>background</strong>. Let's say I want to make the background look more <strong>blown out</strong>. I can make an <strong>adjustment layer</strong> where that section exclusively gets affected. This creates more of that <strong>distance</strong> we're talking about. We can do this in multiple layers, depending on what we're going for.</p>

<p>I might even keep this for later, it might be useful to single out. Similarly, if I go on that same layer and select the <strong>inverse</strong>, I have all the area that's in <strong>shadow</strong>. I could make another layer, where I decide if I want all that area to be darker.</p>

<p>One of the ways I mess with that is with <strong>multiply</strong>. You'll see my mask isn't super clean, but if I want to fix it, maybe this is a great way, just color on top of that. Like I said, this is rough and dirty, mostly for teaching you the concepts I play with when I do my own coloring.</p>

<p>Let's say we wanted these guys really in shadow, like the entire foreground. This is what it would feel like. I can adjust it to the extent I like. Maybe I don't actually want them to feel super backlit like that, but I do want the foreground to be just a little bit <strong>darker</strong>. This is the sort of adjustment layer I can play with.</p>

<p>Maybe I just want the foreground to be more <strong>saturated</strong> than the background. That's where I could do something like an <strong>overlay</strong> layer instead.</p>

<h2>Refining Transitions and Adjustments</h2>

<p>That's not too bad. It's a minor tweak, but it might be cool to show. If I select the <strong>ground</strong> because it clearly should have some separation, I can select it like that and cut it out. If I cut away that one section and make it about the same 74% opacity overlay, then my transition can be a little more <strong>smooth</strong>.</p>

<p>I can create a <strong>mask</strong> on top of it, and then what I'm going to do, really for my own enjoyment, is <strong>airbrush</strong> it away so that the overlay goes away slightly. It's not doing as much as I wanted, so let's try the opposite. Let's match this hard light and have that be the thing that's fading away.</p>

<p>That's a really subtle thing, but having that transition to the background be a little <strong>softer</strong> might be something to play with. I think I'll combine these things. This can be one layer, and now that I have a smoother transition down there, and this color is currently just adding a little bit of saturation and moving everything towards that kind of dirty teal color, it's not bad. Just going to clean up some of this masking.</p>

<h2>Exploring Different Looks with Adjustment Layers</h2>

<p>The adjustments here are pretty subtle, but I'm adding layers that I could play with and do really different things with. I'm happy with where this is, but for demo's sake, I'll show the variety of things I might decide to do instead.</p>

<p>Let's say I want to go for a more <strong>cheerful look</strong>, make everything a lot more <strong>warm</strong>. I might just change these two layers I've made, rather than touching everything, and more quickly affect the overall piece.</p>

<p>These are pretty subtle, though, so if I were trying to move the whole piece towards a very different color feel from what I started with, I'd have to do additional layer work on top. So let's say I add one more. Maybe I'll just do a <strong>soft light</strong> on everything. Now, I've moved the piece from an overcast day to feeling like an <strong>afternoon warmth</strong>. It depends on what you're going for.</p>

<p>Or maybe doing something like this gives you an idea for something you prefer. Then you could say, "Actually, I'm liking where this is going. Maybe I'll change the color of the <strong>sky</strong> to match, to play into the afternoon look." Then you're just a few adjustments away from getting that to work.</p>

<p>I think for me, I'm going to stay more towards what I started with, but maybe I'll <strong>amp things up</strong> a bit here as well. Maybe I can keep that adjustment layer and add a bit more <strong>intensity</strong> into the saturation, cooling it down even further from what I had previously.</p>

<p>Oh, actually, that's because I turned everything yellow.</p>

<p>Okay, so this might be a good baseline. I think changing the color of the sky was pretty cool, really intensifies things. But I do want separation from the foreground, so it's got to be a pretty different color. This is making it like a very pretty, picturesque day. Then maybe I can tone this down.</p>

<h2>Reviewing the Adjustments</h2>

<p>Okay, cool. So here are the <strong>adjustment layers</strong> that I made. If you want to see a before and after, this was before, aside from the sky, and then kind of just really crushing things down. In reality, I'll probably tweak it further, but this is what this phase is about.</p>

<p>The one thing I'm less keen on with these adjustments is how much the <strong>red</strong> gets turned into gray when it was kind of a signature color for Conan here. So I'm going to tweak it further, and then we'll move on.</p>

<p>I may even <strong>isolate</strong> it so that it doesn't affect the red as much. I've selected where the red is, and if I clear it off of this, then it's no longer affecting that red. I can get the adjustment everywhere else. Still thinking it's affecting too many other things. Let me see if I can just move it below a threshold. Now it's only affecting everything that's below my red color. Some of the grays are missing it, but maybe that's better than before, and I can just do it a little bit.</p>

<h2>Preview of Next Steps</h2>

<p>To give you a preview of what we'll be doing next, I'll be adding <strong>shadows</strong> next, then <strong>lighting</strong>, adding <strong>highlights</strong>, and things like that. Finally, I'll have <strong>finishing touches</strong>, which depend on what the piece might need, things like coloring in the lines or adding subtle glows or lighting effects.</p>
