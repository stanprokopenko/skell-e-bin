<p>I've decided to draw an anvil from eye level, using perspective techniques to guide the construction.</p>

<h2>Setting Up the Horizon Line and Vanishing Points</h2>

<p>First, I establish the <strong>horizon line</strong> in the image. I overlay two pages of vellum to have the grid whispered in the background. I need to choose a front corner for my box, and I've got a point here to ensure the box stays within the picture.</p>

<p>I'll run the front corner up to a certain point and end it somewhere else, giving me the <strong>height of the box</strong>. I know where the <strong>vanishing points</strong> are. So that's two bits of information: the height of the box and the position of the vanishing points. Now I've got my three axes to place things.</p>

<h2>Determining the Box Dimensions</h2>

<p>However, I don't yet know how <strong>wide</strong> or <strong>deep</strong> the box will be. That's a decision I'll make. I need to create a rectangle that, from the front, is <strong>higher than it is wide</strong>. Because this is a fairly wide-angle view, it will end up being <strong>skinnier</strong> on the front, as objects appear narrower when they're closer to us in wide-angle perspective.</p>

<p>I don't want to get it exactly correct, I want it to look good. If it's too wide, it won't look right. So I'll make it skinnier. We'll be able to test it in a moment, by running the corners back to the vanishing points.</p>

<p>As soon as we choose how far back this rectangle goes, remember, that will be the rectangle from the side in which it all must fit. How far back should it go? I'll take it as far back as I dare. It is a wide-angle view, and it might be overdoing it, but let's see what happens.</p>

<p>My guess is that the back rectangle will be <strong>too square</strong>. Let's see. We run the corners back to the vanishing points. This is a lot different than working with the blob approach or carving into a box. As square as that is, it's tolerable. Between this one and this one, we've got something that I think will work.</p>

<p>Remember, this is a box to find some positions, and that's all it is. When we put the object in there, we're going to try to make it like the one where we're looking up at it and down at it, but it'll be facing the other way. We'll put the point over here on the right.</p>

<p>When we do that, if we've got a horizon line in the picture and we've got a box that the anvil fits into, something like this, the base of the anvil will fit in there, something like that. The <strong>neck</strong> or <strong>waist</strong> of the anvil will be something like that. The <strong>body</strong> of it will start back there and go out here until it makes a big <strong>shoulder</strong>, and then the <strong>horn</strong> will go from there to there.</p>

<p>Look at how much of this image will be <strong>air</strong>. We only used a box to find the points.</p>

<h2>Finding Key Proportions</h2>

<p>Back to the <strong>ortho</strong>, we know the <strong>halfway point</strong> is there, and the base sticks out well in front of the halfway point. Even the back of the front foot is in front of the halfway point.</p>

<p>I'm going to estimate this, we'll get it exact soon. I'm going to place the back <strong>foot</strong> right about there. You might say, isn't that pretty far back? Well, there's a reason and I'll explain it in a moment.</p>

<p>If the halfway point can be found, which it can easily with the very useful <strong>X</strong>, that will give us the halfway point. Notice, in this wide-angle view, it's really scrunched together back there.</p>

<p>If the back of the front foot touches the side and goes there, the other part, the front of the foot, may come out about here. That's a lot of empty space in there. But I'll stand by these proportions.</p>

<p>I want to compare, this is a greater depth than that. The foot is less than the space behind it, so it's quite squeezed together back there. That's a little deeper, hard to tell on a foreshortened plane.</p>

<p>So I'm saying those are my <strong>two feet</strong>. Any way to test them? Well, I can test the whole base by running it over to the far corner, running that point up, connecting some dots. They happen to be landing on the grid, which I didn't plan that way.</p>

<p>Yes, I think that this base, whether it's on the ground there or up here on the top, looks to me like a rectangle that is <strong>deeper than it is wide</strong>. This proportion is deeper than it is wide.</p>

<p>Once we've got that, we'll need to find the <strong>center</strong> of that rectangle. Using our <strong>X</strong> again, it's way back there because of the wideness. Then we'll lift it up on a <strong>height line</strong> about the height of the base once, and then the height of the base again.</p>

<p>This can be really tricky because we're very close to the horizon, and when we're that close, it means that whether a line is going off to the right or off to the left, side to side or front to back, it ends up being the same line almost.</p>

<p>But we'll figure a line in the exact center of the base would go up to there. That will be the height of our center line on the base in which we'll construct.</p>

<p>We're going to construct a <strong>block</strong> in there that will go up to this section, up to that waist, kind of like a throat in the front.</p>

<h2>Constructing the Middle Block</h2>

<p>How will we do it? Well, let's start with that middle line, the <strong>center line</strong>. We'll say that if it were to run all the way out here to there and all the way back to there, it would be about <strong>half</strong>, with a <strong>fourth</strong> in the front there, and a fourth in the back there.</p>

<p>So I'm giving myself a line in the center that will help me find the front and back limits of the block that I'll build.</p>

<h3>Determining the Width</h3>

<p>How about how <strong>wide</strong> it goes? I think it's the same thing. If we say from cross here, that's about a fourth and another fourth, eyeballing this.</p>

<p>We have constructed a base of right angles that can be understood and controlled. I'll need to erase or tamp back some lines.</p>

<h3>Building Up the Form</h3>

<p>Here's where part of the difficulty happens. When I lift up a vertical line from that corner, it goes right over the top of the one at the center. How high do I raise this line? I don't know yet. We'll find out.</p>

<p>We're going to find out by running that line on the base up there, running it up here.</p>

<p><strong>What are you doing?</strong> Watch this top. If we extend it forward from that vanishing point over there left, we'll give us that point there. Now watch what happens.</p>

<p>The height of that center that was at the center now comes down to here, and that will go over to the right vanishing point. Let's aim that to the left vanishing point, and it will meet its vertical there. This corner will go very horizontal off to the right vanishing point.</p>

<p>And this one is slightly aiming up, they're slightly aiming up as they go away but very horizontal. Now we've got a form in the center of that base, and that gives us the elevated body.</p>

<p>We will connect these corners and these corners, but we'll do it later. I want to get another landmark in here.</p>

<h2>Adding the Hanging End</h2>

<p>Another landmark that we know to be the case is the position of the <strong>hanging end</strong>. We know that the hanging end is about half the distance left to right in the center, so a fourth, a fourth, a fourth, a fourth. We don't need to be absolutely precise about it, we need to do that and say that looks close enough.</p>

<p>That corner will then, it's back there in the box, it will come down but not as tall as the base. We can see that to that.</p>

<p>What about this line? That line will aim back, or in this case, since I'm working with my right hand, emerge from the left vanishing point.</p>

<p>How far forward? <strong>Okay, here's a trick.</strong> We could do it a couple of ways. We know on the ortho that if that's the halfway point, it's well in front of the halfway point. It's in front of the back of the front foot, but it does not go as far forward as the front foot.</p>

<p>So we'll take from the side wall, we'll take that halfway point up there. Oh gosh, no. We'll take it from where we know it goes. It goes from right about here forward, we're talking back to front, right about there, runs up to the top surface, and then off to the right vanishing point. And where it lands, there will work.</p>

<p>I think I'll take it a little further forward because my instinct tells me that it needs it. These are not exact like they will be. That corner will then aim off to the right vanishing point. It will not go as far as I'm bringing it because it doesn't make it over to the other side.</p>

<h3>Connecting the Dots</h3>

<p>How far does it make it? We'll see in a moment. If I connect this corner to that corner with a straight line, it will give me something to develop later. If I connect this corner to that corner, and this one to that one, look, it's just a straight line, we can't see the curve at all. And this one to this one, those will turn into <strong>curves</strong> later.</p>

<p>Now, the body extends beyond the halfway point. The body extends at the same width as the face. So I can come down to this halfway and run that out until it would meet a vertical of the face of that face, which is called the <strong>shoulder</strong>, this corner, off to the right vanishing point.</p>

<p>Getting an awful lot of lines here that can be confusing. Let's go from that face over there to see where to stop. Let's stop right there. I think we've got the face of the face, or the shoulder.</p>

<p>Let's get rid of some of the lines that can confuse. We will now create the <strong>step</strong>, which will go down, and the <strong>horn</strong>, which will reach its peak around there. It has a shoulder, yeah, it has a shoulder about here and reaches its peak below.</p>

<p>This is not an ellipse, but we are trying to make it symmetrical in perspective and looking at the shape that it makes on the front view of the ortho. Then that step that is a drop down will happen there.</p>

<h3>Finding the Center</h3>

<p>Where do we go to? Well, we can do again a quick <strong>X</strong> to find the center right there. That is where the horn will point.</p>

<p>So if we go from a center there and run a string, wait, let's get the arc right on the top. It goes quite straightforward and then makes a rise, which means since it's going primarily straightforward, we would just run a line on one of the Z lines parallel with them until it says, <strong>"I shall rise a bit."</strong> ""**"</p>

<p>Then from down here, it is a more regular curve like part of a sphere, but I think it does curve a little more severely when it gets to the final part.</p>

<p>That is a non-thick section, it's just like a little slice, a <strong>sagittal slice</strong>. I didn't in here create a horizontal section, a <strong>transverse section</strong>, which would have been a line like that. Let's do it quickly, because that can help us keep in mind what we're doing.</p>

<p>It can also create more lines than you want, but when you're trying to find a halfway point anywhere in there that is the halfway height inside the box, you know that you would find it within that transverse plane.</p>

<p>This, which made a line on the side of the box like that, then would go off to the vanishing point on the right, touch the line on the other side of the box, go down, touch the base, and then connect over here.</p>

<p>What section would that be? The transverse section? No, it would be, you say it before I do, it would be the <strong>coronal section</strong>, and this, if it were just credit card thin, would be a <strong>sagittal center</strong>.</p>

<h2>Sketching the Anvil's Features</h2>

<p>What do we've got to do now? From the hanging end to the waist, it curves mainly going forward and then making an abrupt turn down. So let's bring that line forward and then curve it down. I think that is good.</p>

<p>What about from this corner to this corner? We've got a straight line to guide us, but if we look at it, we see that it goes quite down and then spreads back. So let's take that line and go quite down and then spread back. I think that gives the subtlety of that line.</p>

<p>What about this one? It is going down and then forward, but it's coming so straight at us we can't tell. But over here, we can go from that corner to this corner and do the same thing we did at the back, make it go down significantly and then spread out to the front.</p>

<p>I think at this point we can get rid of what we needed to find those points.</p>

<h3>Creating the Notch</h3>

<p>We could make a line that goes from the center of that front block to the center of here and make it a compromise between this straight line and this curved line. I would make it perhaps like that, and that gives me an area in which I can create that <strong>notch</strong> and try to make the notch conform both to this and the shape that I know it is going off there. If we were to see through this, it might be something like that.</p>

<h3>Defining the Side Planes</h3>

<p>How about the side? Well, we found out that if a line on the side of the body, or a cross-contour line scribed right into the middle, that it would not go straight down, and it wouldn't go straight out there. It would <strong>slightly taper out</strong> about half the height, maybe a little less than that, and then it opens, it splits.</p>

<p>If we connect this with a straight line and this with a straight line, we made them symmetrical on that center, and then this would aim back, or would it? If that center goes straight down and hits the ground, or this would hit that, then it would go like so. We'd see all the way through to the inside.</p>

<p>Now look what I've done. I'll darken the lines that we'll keep. Now we've got a plane hidden in there, and we could turn it into curves.</p>

<p>Actually, I'm ignoring the fact that this <strong>dips down a little bit</strong>. Let's fix it. This dips down a little bit. It's hard to tell that it dips down a little bit over here because it's coming toward us. And then this rounds out.</p>

<h3>Working on the Horn</h3>

<p>The last thing we'll do is the <strong>horn</strong>. The horn, which has a side portion of that step that is squared off, would meet its analogous point over there, but we won't see it because the center line of the horn is going to not be visible, it is slightly above us.</p>

<p>Therefore, this line, which is a contour, is pretty much the same line as the center line. And this line, which is a contour, is also pretty much the same line as the center line.</p>

<p>Since it's made of metal and opaque, I think it would be wise to erase the lines on the other side and then put a <strong>cross-contour</strong> for the collar. I want to look at the ortho, try to get a curve that feels true.</p>

<p>Here's something important: that is a side plane, and then that becomes not a side plane somewhere around there.</p>

<p>I think I need to put in <strong>shading</strong>, you'd call it a <strong>terminator</strong>, a point where this curved line is side, and then somewhere around here we can't say it's side anymore.</p>

<p>When it goes level, it will aim slightly up, so we get a radical curve there. Let's do the same thing over here, maybe make it a little more round here.</p>

<p>That is going over the hill, and because it's going over the hill, it'll end up pointing down to its vanishing point if it were straight. So I'll make it quite curved at the side, and then by the time it hits this, the center line's there, terminator's there.</p>

<p>**Watch what happens. ** We really curve that line, and we can do one more. I think right about here it would aim down as it goes away. If it were straight, it would aim, oh, here it's actually because it's above the horizon line. Now here it was below, it would continue to aim down.</p>

<p>We'll go all the way out here and do a fourth one.</p>

<h2>Finalizing the Drawing</h2>

<p>I think the next step will be to <strong>clean this up</strong>. That was without looking at an anvil in that position, only looking at the orthos. An invented, find your way around the grid in 3D drawing.</p>
