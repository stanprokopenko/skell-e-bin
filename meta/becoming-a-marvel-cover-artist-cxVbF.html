<h2>About Me and My Work</h2>

<p>My name is <strong>Eric Gist</strong>, but you'll often see me credited as <strong>EMGIST</strong>. I've worked on a lot of different stuff, mainly as a comic cover artist. I've done covers for <strong>Fantastic Four</strong>, <strong>Iron Fist</strong>, <strong>Wolverine</strong>, and <strong>Hulk</strong>. Most of my work has been variant covers, which are the secondary covers released alongside the main ones.</p>

<p>Picking a favorite cover is tough because I like a lot of them for different reasons. It's probably between my <strong>Fantastic Four</strong> cover and my <strong>Hulk</strong> cover. The Hulk cover was cool because it was an action scene, which I don't do a ton of. It featured a classic fight between <strong>Wolverine and Hulk</strong>, something almost every comic artist wants to do. Plus, it was <strong>zombie Wolverine</strong>, which was pretty cool since I'm known for doing zombies.</p>

<p>The Fantastic Four cover was fun because there was more storytelling involved. With multiple characters, each with their own characteristics and the whole family dynamic, trying to work that into a single image was a good challenge and something I really enjoyed.</p>

<h2>How I Got Started in Comics</h2>

<p>I did my first comic cover around <strong>2007</strong>, so I've been doing this for about <strong>15 years</strong>. I started working with <strong>Marvel</strong> in <strong>2016</strong>. My first work for them was a series of covers for the <strong>Haunted Mansion</strong> series. Then, my first real Marvel character cover was for the anniversary issue of <strong>Crazy</strong> in <strong>2019</strong>.</p>

<p>The first thing I wanted to do in art was <strong>draw comic books</strong>. I've been into comics since I was a little kid, probably around eight years old. Back then, I wanted to do interiors. During the '90s boom, when comics started becoming more mainstream, I worked on doing interiors. I was terrible, but I did submissions every month to all the companies and got tons of rejection letters—some of which I still have.</p>

<p>Then I started training with <strong>Jeff Watts</strong> and found out I had more of a knack for <strong>single-image storytelling</strong>. I still loved the genre of comics, but I wanted to get more into painting and covers. It took me about <strong>ten years</strong> to get good enough and another five to catch on doing them.</p>

<p>I broke into the industry by taking my work to <strong>Comic-Con</strong>, showing interior samples at first. I realized I was better suited for cover work. Doing painted interiors is tough—there aren't many artists who do it, and those who do are amazing. For comics specifically, I've only done covers. I've been asked to do interiors a couple of times, but it wasn't anything that grabbed my interest.</p>

<h2>My Artistic Style and Influences</h2>

<p>Broadly speaking, my style is often dictated by how I feel about the characters. I try to convey that feeling in the image. I'm probably known for <strong>deep shadows</strong>, <strong>high contrast</strong>, and <strong>moodier stuff</strong>—kind of a noir or horror feel. Something <strong>darker</strong> is what I'm known for.</p>

<p>In the last year or two, I've been branching out into some brighter-colored stuff. I've been getting asked to do brighter characters. For example, the <strong>Fantastic Four</strong> aren't known for being dark and moody, so that was a lot of fun. I went in a sort of <strong>Norman Rockwell direction</strong> with that—he's one of my favorite artists of all time.</p>

<p>With my <strong>Iron Fist</strong> cover, I went in a brighter-colored direction, showing the history of the character. I wanted to show the brighter side—the literal passing of the torch in a way. The darker, moodier stuff makes up the lion's share of my work, but I've been privileged to work on things that are a bit out of my wheelhouse. I don't want to get stuck doing the same thing over and over. I want to be one of those guys that gets asked to do just about everything.</p>

<p>There are a lot of artists that I admire, especially from the past and many from today as well. The artists I really pick out are those who balance an <strong>iconic image</strong> with a story behind it. I strive to create images that stand out and stick in people's minds—something that stands the test of time. I look to create that initial read that you'll never forget, like a moment burned into your memory.</p>

<h2>Advice for Aspiring Comic Artists</h2>

<h3>Specialize but Stay Versatile</h3>

<p>That's a tough question, but I'd definitely <strong>specialize</strong>. As far as specializing in what, that depends on where your fire is and where your natural abilities lie. Get really, really good at one thing first. You're better off than being mediocre at three different things. Be really good at one thing, and as you establish yourself, you can start branching out.</p>

<p>Comics seem to be heading in the direction of the <strong>well-rounded artist</strong>. When I was a kid, there were pencilers, inkers, and colorists—each with their own role. Now, those lines are getting blurry. Art directors and editors like to see someone who can do it all, making it one-stop shopping for them.</p>

<p>It's good to know a little bit of everything. I always tell people: <strong>Be a jack of all trades, master of one</strong>. It's good to be familiar with all aspects, so when you're communicating with your inker, colorist, or writer, you come from a standpoint of knowledge.</p>

<h3>Work on Your Fundamentals</h3>

<p>To get better at making covers specifically, <strong>study the people who are good at it</strong>. Don't limit yourself to just contemporary artists. Go back to cover artists throughout the long history of illustration, not just comic cover artists. Study narrative painters from before print, like <strong>Bouguereau</strong>, <strong>Caravaggio</strong>, and <strong>Rembrandt</strong>. I look at their work as much or more than I do artists working today.</p>

<p>One of the things that sets my work apart is that it has a timeless feel. I strive for that in my artwork—I don't want it to feel trendy or modern, but I also don't want it to feel dated. I encourage artists to look at a wide variety of influences.</p>

<p>Beyond that, <strong>work on your fundamentals</strong>:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Figure Drawing</strong>: This includes basic drawing, fundamental forms, lighting, and anatomy.</li>

<li><strong>Composition</strong>: Putting the figure into an interesting composition.</li>

<li><strong>Perspective</strong>: Understanding how to represent space and form.</li>

<li><strong>Color Theory</strong>: Developing a good understanding of how colors work together.</li>

</ul>

<p>When it comes to being good, they're all important, but figures are crucial because comics are about people first and foremost. If you can draw a cool, dynamic figure, you can get away with a lot in other areas. Not that I'm encouraging that, but you're more likely to get work drawing a great Spider-Man and a mediocre car than the other way around.</p>

<h3>Make Covers to Get Better</h3>

<p>If you want to get better at making covers, <strong>make covers</strong>. Make some bad covers and get them out of your system. Do a lot of them—that's how you're going to get better. But that's still going to be built on good, solid fundamentals. Find someplace where you can learn that. Study hard, have a wide variety of influences, and make covers.</p>

<h3>Develop Your Own Style</h3>

<p>Avoid getting too caught up in <strong>forcing style</strong>. Study your influences and let your style emerge naturally. Don't try to force it, because that can end up feeling false. It can make you a second-rate version of another artist, which can happen to a certain degree in the beginning of your career. Don't try too much to be someone else. Have your influences but let them find their way into your work organically. <strong>Be yourself</strong>.</p>

<h2>Creativity and Limitations</h2>

<p>Of course, it's limiting to try and fit as much of a story as you can into one image, or represent an entire plot line in a single image—but it's limiting in a good way. Limitations or restrictions can <strong>breed creativity</strong> because you have to find a way around them. You have to find a creative solution, and the more creative you have to be, the more likely you are to be original.</p>

<p>It's why <strong>thumbnails</strong> are such an important part of the process. A friend of mine once said that the first five thumbnails you do are always someone else's idea. You have to get to that fifth thumbnail point. Usually, I do five thumbnails that are someone else's idea without realizing it—they're things I've seen before. Then another five that are bad ideas. Finally, around the tenth sketch, you start getting into something unique and good.</p>

<p>As you get more experienced, you can leapfrog those first five to a certain degree because you've drawn them before. You might still have the ideas, but you don't waste time doodling them anymore.</p>

<h2>What I Wish I Knew Starting Out</h2>

<p>I started doing comic covers when I already had quite a bit of knowledge and experience under my belt. I'd worked in video games for about five years and done illustration in other areas for about five years. I just wish I knew <strong>how good you had to be</strong>. That's the big thing—each level you go up, especially in comics, there's this tier system.</p>

<p>You'll start off working for third or fourth-tier companies. It's not that those companies aren't good or that you're not doing good work; it's that you aren't in front of the broad populace as much. If you're doing covers for a book that's selling 4,000 copies, it's different than doing covers for a book that's selling 80,000 copies.</p>

<p>You want to make sure you're as good as you possibly can be before you're getting broad exposure to a large audience. I didn't rush it, but I wish I would have known <strong>how good you had to be</strong>. When I was seventeen or eighteen, I was doing pages and submitting them to Marvel, DC, and Image, which was ridiculous. But I didn't know any better, and it didn't hurt at all—it kept me motivated and producing work.</p>

<p>Now, years later, I'm doing covers, and I still look at my work and sometimes think, <strong>I wish that was better</strong>. It's on the rack next to people like <strong>Alex Ross</strong> and <strong>Totino Tedesco</strong>, and all these great cover artists. You're competing for sales with those people.</p>

<p>You don't want to make it all about the sales, but it's part of the job. Your job is to sell comics. To me, my job is to create a good image, but for the company you're working for, it's about selling books. You have to be able to sell books, and you want to make sure you're good enough to do that.</p>

<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>My journey in comic cover art has been a long one, filled with learning and growth. I've learned the importance of specializing while staying versatile, working on fundamentals, studying a wide range of artists, and developing your own style. Embrace limitations—they can foster creativity. Always strive to be better and understand the level of skill required to succeed.</p>

<p>Remember, <strong>be yourself</strong>, work hard, and keep creating.</p>
