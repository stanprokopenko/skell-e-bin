<p>Hi everybody,</p>

<p>I'm responding to the two demos that Phil Dimitriotis did of his <strong>melted pancakes</strong> approach. Many of you seemed to really enjoy it. By now, over a thousand of you have seen it, and there have been a couple of hundred posts. While I'd love to get Phil's response, I want to take some time to share my thoughts.</p>

<p>One of you posted Ernest Watson's introduction to his approach about theory and practice in his wonderful book, <em>How to Use Creative Perspective</em>. He explained how his education unfolded:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The first day of school... we were ushered into a large studio in the center of which was a disordered pile of wooden grocery boxes of assorted shapes and sizes. We were directed to draw the boxes. That was our only instruction. We were given no perspective theory, no hint of any kind of procedure. This went on for six weeks, without any theory whatsoever. The accuracy of our observation was checked and corrected by the instructor who admonished us to use our eyes more expertly.</p>

<p>At the end of six weeks, we were finally taught the scientific facts of perspective. When I began teaching perspective at Pratt Institute, I reasoned that it would have been better had we, at the outset, been given some theory that would have warned us what to look for. I soon changed my opinion. I discovered that my own students very readily mastered the theory but still they couldn't draw. That was because they lacked the very attitude that was forced upon me by that six weeks' grind."</p>

</blockquote>

<p>There's a term for this, <strong>wicked learning</strong>. It's when students are put in a position where they have to solve problems on their own, finding new ways without direct instruction. I read Watson's introduction several times when I was in my late twenties, and it made an impression on me. Not that we should have you solving problems for six weeks without guidance, I agree with his later reflection that this might be overdoing it, but it highlighted how we learn.</p>

<p>We learn by <strong>trying to do things, failing, and figuring them out</strong>, but we also need theory. One without the other creates trouble.</p>

<h2>Balancing Theory and Practice in Our Course</h2>

<p>Let me share how our course is structured. The <strong>first half</strong> focuses on understanding how perspective works. The <strong>second half</strong> puts you through rigor to get it into your brain and hand at the same time. Even in the second half, we'll include theory about how things measure back in space and around forms.</p>

<p>In the <strong>first half</strong>, which is about theory, we're also getting you to <strong>practically figure things out on your own</strong> and get you drawing. I'm aware of the two ways of learning and I'm trying to <strong>balance</strong> them so each part has some of the other.</p>

<h2>The Melted Pancakes Exercise</h2>

<p>The <strong>melted pancake</strong> exercise is a fun project that anyone can do. It gets you having fun with form. At some point, you might say, "I'd like it to look more convincing." That's great, because it means you're ready to dive deeper.</p>

<h3>Common Issues with Ground Planes</h3>

<p>The most common problem I see is the way these pancakes <strong>lay on the ground</strong>. Let's look at some examples from your work.</p>

<h4>Johannes' Diagram</h4>

<p>Johannes gave us a wonderful diagram and did a very responsible receding layout without any dramatic warping.</p>

<h4>Dennis Yeary and Anke's Perspective</h4>

<p>Dennis Yeary's work shows dramatic warping. This pancake is quite open and close to us, while this one is supposedly up near the horizon line but still very open. Anke did similar ones that are quite open below us and become dramatically thinner as they recede.</p>

<p>By doing this, you've introduced problems, and we'll solve them in <strong>Lesson 9</strong>. But I want to point something out. The ones that are more open feel closer, as if we're looking down at them. But they also don't feel that close. If we were hovering closer, the <strong>law of diminution</strong> would make these much bigger, just a little section would fill the lower part of the frame.</p>

<h4>Bridging Open and Closed Shapes</h4>

<p>Look at the difference between this open pancake and this closed one. You might want to bridge them with a group that's somewhere in between. How exactly we'll handle that is more than we need to think about now. What's important is recognizing that <strong>as objects recede toward the horizon, they appear more closed</strong>.</p>

<h3>Understanding Perspective Changes</h3>

<p>Let's revisit Johannes' diagram showing pancakes below us, coming up toward the horizon, and going into the distance. Even though the closer pancake is more open than the one behind it, this isn't through a wide-angle lens, and we're not even that close to it. We could be many blocks away, zoomed in, which makes the differences less dramatic.</p>

<p>This concept is coming up in <strong>Lessons 11 and 12</strong>. It explores how <strong>proximity affects</strong> perception. If you really want to make something look like it's under your feet and close, <strong>open it up more</strong>.</p>

<h4>Han's Example</h4>

<p>Look at what Han did. These pancakes are below us in these vertical layouts, very open here, and as they go back, they become thinner as they approach the horizon. This effectively conveys depth on the ground plane.</p>

<h4>Rachel Dawn Owens' Work</h4>

<p>Rachel gave us examples where the pancakes are quite close to us and gradually recede toward the horizon. Thank you, Rachel. Swivel this design 90 degrees, and you'll see that the more you exaggerate with a wide-angle lens, the more these shapes change from open to closed as they go away from you.</p>

<h4>Pixel's Commitment to 3D</h4>

<p>Pixel made a full commitment, accounting for the see-through planes in 30 minutes. Couldn't ask for better.</p>

<h4>Sandra Salem's Creative World</h4>

<p>Sandra Salem developed a whole Looney Tunes, Dr. Seuss world with refined technique.</p>

<h4>Michelle Johnson's Analysis</h4>

<p>Michelle Johnson analyzed the forms separately, put them together, developed shading, and drew through the shapes, a big part of understanding form.</p>

<h4>Brandon's Gradual Thinning</h4>

<p>Brandon is developing a good eye for that <strong>gradual thinning</strong> as the pancakes recede.</p>

<h4>Ethan's Scientific Approach</h4>

<p>Ethan is turning it into a science, explaining what's going on and doing two kinds of work. One is the understanding of the forms by ghosting all the way through, and the other is the work of the environment with the horizon line in there. This is a beautiful example of opening it up underneath your feet and thinning it as it goes to the horizon.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p>That was the main lesson I wanted to offer in response to all this marvelous work. The melted pancakes exercise was meant to be fun and relatively easy, and it got you started. A good deal of mastering perspective is intuitive, even when you understand the theory. In most of your sketching, you'll rely on what looks right.</p>

<p>Phil has been very busy, and we might not be able to get him down to the studio or have him respond on camera. But I'll ask him if he can respond in the comments by looking at your work and sharing his thoughts.</p>

<p>See you soon!</p>
