<h2>Reviewing Lesson Two Materials</h2>

<p>Let's review the materials for lesson two: <strong>pencils, papers, T-squares, and triangles</strong>. I hope you've been working with them or at least playing around.</p>

<h2>Practicing with Optical Illusions</h2>

<p>What better way to practice than by trying your hand at <strong>optical illusions</strong>? Copy them as you've done or invent your own, as you did. Good show, Christian!</p>

<p>Using <strong>grid paper</strong>, you can redraw your illusions freehand before we move back into theory in our next lesson.</p>

<h2>Developing Hand Skills</h2>

<p>If you want to develop your hand skills to meet your brain skills, here's a challenge:</p>

<h3>Drawing Circles and Bisecting Lines</h3>

<ul>

<li><strong>Draw a circle</strong> with a compass.</li>

<li><strong>Bisect it through the center</strong> with a horizontal line, then a vertical line.</li>

</ul>

<p>Know this, it's not easy. If you do it badly a few hundred times but tolerate that because you want to rely less on tools, or even for personal reasons like proving your pluck, you'll gradually gain control of your lines and move beyond theory to practice.</p>

<h3>Freehand Lines at All Angles</h3>

<p>In response to Peter Hahn's demo of straight lines, students like John have asked, "Should I rotate my sketchbook at all, or am I creating a bad habit?"</p>

<p>It's not a bad habit, but if you're ambitious for freehand command, <strong>draw lines all around at all angles</strong>. Maybe we'll make it a challenge. Okay, it's a challenge!</p>

<h2>Bisecting Quadrants and Drawing Angles</h2>

<p>Now, <strong>try bisecting a quadrant by drawing a 45-degree angle</strong>. Pull it all the way through.</p>

<p>Lines in the upper left take us down into the lower right's regions of nether. And then again, as above, so below.</p>

<h2>Practice Makes Perfect</h2>

<p>I warn you: if you are new to this, you will suck at it, like I do at jokes. But if you keep trying, not settling for theory that tingles your brain but leaves your lines limp, and practice this five to ten minutes a day through this course hundreds of times, even on templates like this, your <strong>hand skills can rise to your brain skills</strong>.</p>

<p>Understanding. Freehanding. Go to it.</p>
