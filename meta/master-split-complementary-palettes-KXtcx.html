<h2>Setting Up the Canvas</h2>

<p>I'm going to create another painting of the same subject, but I want to avoid redrawing the line art. Here's a quick method to generate a line drawing from the previous study:</p>

<ol>

<li>Duplicate the layer to preserve the original</li>

<li>Go to Filter &gt; Stylize &gt; Find Edges in Photoshop</li>

<li>Optionally, go to Image &gt; Adjust &gt; Levels to refine the contrast</li>

<li>Use the level sliders to enhance whites and darks</li>

</ol>

<p>This process takes about 30 seconds and yields an identical line drawing to the first painting. It's not perfect, though, so I'll do some manual cleanup:</p>

<ul>

<li>Erase unnecessary details in the trees using white paint</li>

<li>Remove outlines of brushstrokes on the bridge</li>

<li>Eliminate outlines of light strokes on the grass</li>

</ul>

<p>Now, I'll hide the original painting layer, create a new layer on top, and fill it with white. I'll name the new line drawing layer "line drawing two" and set its blending mode to multiply.</p>

<p><strong>Pro tip:</strong> If you're working in the same PSD file, group related layers using Shift+click and Ctrl+G. Remember, backgrounds can't be grouped in Photoshop, so double-click, hit OK, then shift-select everything to group.</p>

<h2>Choosing a Color Palette</h2>

<p>For this painting, I'm introducing a third color to create a <strong>split complementary palette</strong>. This means taking one side (like warm colors) and splitting it into two colors. Mixing these two colors creates intermediary hues.</p>

<p>I've rotated the palette slightly towards green for a green monster and purple shadows. It's important to note that a split complementary shouldn't be too wide; use neighboring hues for best results.</p>

<p>To keep my colors organized, I've indicated the colors I'll be using in a lower section of the canvas. I've also rearranged my color chart for quick access during painting.</p>

<h2>Blocking in Basic Colors</h2>

<p>I start by blocking in overall temperature delineations: the foreground and character will be warmer, while the background will be cooler. Using the selection tool and hue/saturation adjustment, I darken and increase saturation in certain areas.</p>

<p>It's crucial to <strong>start with neutralized colors</strong> and build up saturation gradually. I introduce all three colors early, including mixtures. I scumble in influences of green and orange, feeding colors into each other.</p>

<p>For shadows, I use purples, working neutralized purples over neutralized warms. I encourage a sketchy approach at the beginning to foster exploration.</p>

<h2>Applying Color Theory</h2>

<p>As I work, I'm constantly thinking about color relationships. I use purples for shadows, but I make sure the green local color of the monster is present throughout. Even white objects like stones get color from various light sources hitting them.</p>

<p>I balance warm and cool colors across the painting, introducing green from the palette into grass areas. It's important to mix colors on the palette to help render different light sources realistically.</p>

<p><strong>Pro tip:</strong> Outdoor sketching is great for studying light and color effects. Carry a sketchbook or digital device for plein air painting practice.</p>

<h2>Photoshop Techniques for Painting</h2>

<p>I use various Photoshop techniques to achieve different effects:</p>

<ul>

<li>Linear dodge blending mode for lighting effects</li>

<li>Soft light blending mode for subtle color adjustments</li>

<li>Smudge tool to soften hard edges left by selections</li>

<li>Watercolor brush for glazing technique</li>

</ul>

<p>Don't be afraid to experiment with different blending modes in your studies. Each can provide unique effects that enhance your painting.</p>

<h2>Creating Depth and Atmosphere</h2>

<p>To create a sense of depth and atmosphere, I focus on lighting and environmental effects:</p>

<ul>

<li>Add skylight to the top of bricks and the monster's head</li>

<li>Use overlay brush mode with lighter colors for warm bounce light effects</li>

<li>Apply ambient light (skylight, bounce light) to create a luminous feeling</li>

<li>Use the airbrush for subtle warm light effects on the pond and grass</li>

</ul>

<p>I also fill out the sky with smaller shapes to create a forest feel. This adds depth to the background and enhances the overall atmosphere of the scene.</p>

<h2>Refining Details and Textures</h2>

<p>As I refine the painting, I pay attention to small details that add realism:</p>

<ul>

<li>Vary the darkness and shapes of brick crevices to avoid repetition</li>

<li>Add highlights to the monster's eyes</li>

<li>Break outlines to indicate imperfect surfaces for realism</li>

<li>Add minimal details like hair strands and teeth</li>

</ul>

<p>Remember, it's important to base overall decisions on reality, even if you're deviating in character design and color amount.</p>

<h2>Light and Shadow Techniques</h2>

<p>Consistent lighting is key to a believable painting. I apply the same lighting principles to different elements (stones, monster's head, eyeballs). Here are some techniques I use:</p>

<ul>

<li>Apply purple light from the sky to the shapes and stones, dropping the value slightly</li>

<li>Increase saturation of purple in shadows for temperature change effect</li>

<li>Use overlay brush for warm glow effects around light sources</li>

<li>Maintain consistent light direction for direct sunlight</li>

</ul>

<p>I also use the lasso tool to isolate the background and lighten areas around the monster for contrast. Remember, you can increase contrast in opposite areas to make something appear lighter/darker or warmer/cooler.</p>

<h2>Final Touches and Recommendations</h2>

<p>As I finish up the painting, here are some final tips:</p>

<ul>

<li>Flip the canvas regularly to catch mistakes early</li>

<li>Mix colors more freely when values are close together</li>

<li>Be specific with color choices when changing values</li>

<li>Populate the painting with all three chosen colors (split complementary palette)</li>

<li>Include micro-movements between warm and cool colors even in shadow areas</li>

</ul>

<p>Remember, color keying is a specialized field in the entertainment industry. The more you practice these techniques, the better you'll become at creating compelling, realistic digital paintings.</p>
