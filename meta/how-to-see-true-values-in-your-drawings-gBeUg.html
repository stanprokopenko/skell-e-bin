<p>Now that you understand what <strong>values</strong> are, let's explore how we actually see values in the world around us. Sometimes, you can't trust your eyes. This is important for accurately representing <strong>light, shadow, and form</strong> in your drawings.</p>

<h2>Value Relationships</h2>

<p>When drawing, it's crucial to think about the <strong>relationships between values</strong> rather than individual values in isolation. The values surrounding one value can affect how you perceive that value.</p>

<h3>The Influence of Surrounding Values</h3>

<p>For example, consider these two middle squares. The left one looks a little bit lighter than the middle value, and the right one looks a little bit darker than the middle value. But they're not different at all! They're the exact same <strong>value five</strong>. The surrounding values affect how you perceive the values on the inside.</p>

<h2>The Checkerboard Illusion</h2>

<p>One of the most powerful demonstrations of how our perception of values can fool us is the famous <strong>checkerboard illusion</strong>. Square A looks darker than square B, but only because of context.</p>

<p>Watch this: if we extend the value from A down to B, we clearly see that they're the <strong>same value</strong>. The actual value we see is the <strong>local value plus lighting conditions</strong>. The cylinder is casting a shadow over the white square B, making it darker and equal in value to the black square A that's in light.</p>

<h3>Context and Expectations</h3>

<p>So what's going on here? Are we stupid? No, but our brain is getting tricked. We expect a black square to be darker than any white square, even when a white square is in shadow. The <strong>context</strong> is influencing our expectations, which tricks our perception of the values. Even after we know what's happening, it's still hard to believe that they're the same. Context and expectations are powerful.</p>

<h2>Overriding Automatic Labeling</h2>

<p>This illusion perfectly illustrates why we can't trust our brain's <strong>automatic labeling</strong> of things. When you're drawing, you need to override your brain's tendency to say, "This is a white square, so I'm gonna make it white," or "This is a black square, so I'm gonna make it black." Instead, you need to see and draw the actual values created by the combination of <strong>local value and lighting</strong>.</p>

<h3>The White of the Eye</h3>

<p>This is a very common mistake when drawing portraits. You might make the <strong>white of the eye</strong> literally white, and it can look a little terrifying. Remember that the white of the eye is a portion of the <strong>eyeball</strong>. A ball is a 3D form that has planes facing in all directions, and the value of each plane depends on the angle of the light.</p>

<h2>Comparing Values Accurately</h2>

<p>As you draw, you need to compare values not only to their immediate neighbors but to the <strong>entire picture</strong>, especially comparing them to the <strong>darkest dark</strong> and <strong>lightest light</strong>.</p>

<p>We're going to have exercises and projects to help us get better at seeing the true values.</p>

<h2>Avoiding Tunnel Vision</h2>

<p>Try to change the way you're looking at your drawing, and get a fresh perspective. You can flip it upside down, look in the mirror, tilt your head, tilt the drawing, lean back, anything to get you out of <strong>tunnel vision</strong> and see the values accurately.</p>

<h3>What Is Tunnel Vision?</h3>

<p>Tunnel vision is when you work on an area for a while, and you get so focused on it that you can't see anything else. It's like you're looking at the world through a tunnel, you see only a small portion of the whole picture.</p>

<h3>The Problem with Tunnel Vision</h3>

<p>The problem with this is that you tend to stretch the values in that small portion to a <strong>full value range</strong> or closer to a full value range. For example, an ear that's in shadow, so all the values there are <strong>dark values</strong>. When you compare them to the lights, all the ear's values are clearly much darker.</p>

<p>But if you get tunnel vision and you're working on that ear for a while, and you forget to look at the full picture, the lightest values in the ear start to appear lighter than they actually are. Again, because in relation to everything else you're seeing within that tunnel, they are lighter. What happens often with beginner artists is that these lighter shadows end up way too light in their drawings, they're not shadows anymore, and that breaks the effect of light and shadow on form.</p>

<h3>Breaking Out of Tunnel Vision</h3>

<p>So make it a habit to constantly <strong>back up</strong> from your drawing. If you're standing, then physically walk back. If you're sitting, then lean back and <strong>squint</strong>.</p>

<h2>The Power of Squinting</h2>

<p>We squinted at our value scales to see major differences and blur similarities. Well, you can squint at a complex subject to do the same and make it easier to see the <strong>value relationships</strong>. Squinting blurs the image and reduces details. It simplifies the space into larger groups of value. This helps you identify the main shapes and the accurate value relationships of those shapes.</p>

<h3>Simplifying Complex Forms</h3>

<p>Complex things like hands can be broken down into <strong>primary, secondary, and tertiary forms</strong>. Primaries being the absolute simplest primitive volume. Secondaries are the large masses on top of those primaries, such as the big muscle groups and the bones. And tertiaries are the smaller forms like veins and wrinkles. Squinting helps you identify those primary forms and the most important secondary forms.</p>

<h3>When to Squint</h3>

<p>Squint at your reference more in the beginning of the drawing and less at the later phases when you want to see more details.</p>

<h2>Digital Squinting with Photoshop</h2>

<p>Even squinting is a learned skill, and a really useful tool that can help you understand what you're trying to achieve when you're squinting is the <strong>Median Noise Removal tool</strong> in Photoshop. This is a little better than the simple blur tool because it keeps the edges more accurate, and I find that it's closer to what I actually see when I squint.</p>

<h3>Using the Median Filter</h3>

<p>In Photoshop, go to <strong>Filter</strong> &gt; <strong>Noise</strong> &gt; <strong>Median</strong> and use the slider to determine the amount of squinting. I love this painting by Sargent, and when studying his decisions, I applied this filter. This really helps to see things clearly without the beautifully distracting paint strokes and canvas texture.</p>

<p>I love how he connected the middle values of the bottom lids to the side planes of the head, instead of making them isolated floating shapes. The strong black cast shadow from the nose is also very powerful to add depth. He reserved the full blacks on the face to mostly the nose and a few spots in the eyes and under the mustache.</p>

<h3>Training Wheels</h3>

<p>Keep in mind that digital filters like this are <strong>training wheels</strong>. Eventually, you want to get to the point where you can do this on your own. You don't want to depend on Photoshop to always solve it for you.</p>

<p>If you're drawing from life or from imagination, you need to be able to <strong>organize and see groups of values intuitively</strong>. But if you're just starting out, this is a great training tool to help you see and eventually get there on your own. Just be mindful that it doesn't become a bad habit.</p>

<h2>Stepping Away to Gain Perspective</h2>

<p>Stepping back helps you get a fresh perspective, but sometimes you might need to <strong>step away</strong>.</p>

<ol>

<li>To get some rest if your eyes are getting tired.</li>

<li>Because you might require a full day to clear your mind of memories of the values.</li>

</ol>

<p>You might do a drawing that you feel is accurate, only to come back to it the next day and see mistakes that seem so obvious.</p>

<h2>Developing the Skill of Seeing True Values</h2>

<p>This ability to see the <strong>true values</strong> rather than assumed values is a skill that develops with practice. The more you draw, the more you'll train your eyes to override your brain's <strong>preconceptions</strong> and see values as they truly are. Instead of getting tricked by your reference, you'll be tricking your viewers with your drawings.</p>
