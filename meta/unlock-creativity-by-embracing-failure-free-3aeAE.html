<h2>What's in Premium?</h2>

<p>In this lesson, we explore how academic study informs intuitive drawing, focusing on concepts like the <strong>C, S, and I line principle</strong>. We discuss embracing failure as a vital part of the creative processâ€”acknowledging that <strong>99% of drawing is failure</strong> and each misstep is an opportunity to learn. You'll learn about experimenting with new materials, like using a <strong>chisel tip calligraphy pen</strong>, to keep your art fresh and dynamic. We dive into the role of intuition and confidence when drawing from imagination, and how balancing study with personal creativity enhances your work. Finally, we offer advice for aspiring artists to <strong>just start</strong>, embrace making mistakes, and find joy in the process of creating art.</p>
