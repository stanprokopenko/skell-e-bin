<h2>Initial Setup</h2>

<p>Follow along with the process for homework. Use this as a guide to take notes and remember the steps. Focus on the <strong>shape, tilt, and jaw orientation</strong>. Consider the <strong>chin and head rotation</strong>. Be specific about the <strong>jaw shape</strong>. Gesture the neck with <strong>pinch and stretch</strong>.</p>

<h2>Proportions and Landmarks</h2>

<p>Identify the <strong>brow line, center, and proportions</strong>. Remember <strong>halves and thirds</strong>. Mark the <strong>hairline</strong>. Identify four points: <strong>temple, hairline, back of skull, base of the nose</strong>. Create a <strong>cutout for the head shape</strong>. Consider a <strong>light or thin cutout</strong>. Divide into <strong>quarters to place the ear</strong>.</p>

<h2>Facial Features</h2>

<p>Note the larger <strong>C shape from brow to nose</strong> due to aging. Outline the <strong>chin and cheek on both sides</strong>. Simplify the <strong>cheek</strong>. <strong>Ear, cheek, and jaw</strong> are step six. Think about the <strong>features and their placement</strong>. Mark the <strong>center and eye sockets</strong>. Use <strong>folding planes and the rule of three</strong>. Relate to the <strong>forehead</strong>. Create <strong>overlap of the cheek behind the brow</strong>. Consider the <strong>disc across the face</strong>. Transition the <strong>brow down into the proportion line</strong>. Identify the <strong>socket and nose</strong>. Determine the <strong>width and tip of the nose</strong>. Create a <strong>simple box for the nose</strong>. Customize the <strong>curves and shapes</strong>. Think about the <strong>volume of the eye</strong>. Recognize the <strong>rhythm and curve of the cheek</strong>. Optionally add <strong>glasses</strong>.</p>

<h2>Detailed Features</h2>

<p>Consider the <strong>denture sphere and face curvature</strong>. Identify the <strong>mandible and interruptions</strong>. Note the <strong>ear shape</strong>. Think of <strong>hair as a hat</strong>, like Barbie hair. Use <strong>wrapping lines to shape the hair</strong>. Carve the <strong>hair shape later</strong>. Separate <strong>construction stage notes for reference</strong>. Make notes <strong>minimal to avoid competition with added features</strong>. Indicate the <strong>eye's sphere and attachment</strong>. Start with the <strong>pupil and iris to direct gaze</strong>. Add the <strong>structure of the lid</strong>. Notice the <strong>brow ridge surface</strong>. Develop the <strong>brow ridge perspective</strong>. Observe the <strong>eye plate and socket recession</strong>. Identify the <strong>ribbon idea and twisting</strong>. Recognize the <strong>box shape around the eye</strong>. Note the <strong>lower lid structure and highlight</strong>. Observe the <strong>nasal fat and fat structure under the eye</strong>. Compare to other models. Identify the <strong>keystone and nasal saddle</strong>. Observe the <strong>eye structure and attachment</strong>. Note the <strong>fat and softer forms</strong>. Recognize the <strong>asymmetry between hard and soft structures</strong>. Observe the <strong>cheek plane and perspective</strong>. Consider the <strong>mouth transition</strong>. Develop awareness of the <strong>context around the face</strong>. Pinch the <strong>nasal saddle box and broaden towards the bottom</strong>. Use the <strong>center line for the nose</strong>. Adjust the <strong>width of the nose planes</strong>. Interpret the <strong>nose structure and perspective</strong>. Match the <strong>cheek and malar plane</strong>. Develop the <strong>lips with the philtrum shape</strong>. Check the <strong>proportion line of the lips</strong>. Observe the <strong>differences in lip shapes</strong>. Match the <strong>lip shape to the center of the eye</strong>. Develop the <strong>M and W shapes for the lips</strong>. Observe the <strong>light and shadow differences</strong>. Note the <strong>chin's broad and boxy shape</strong>. Identify the <strong>skin under the jaw and buckle fat</strong>. Recognize the <strong>jowl fat and its impact on aging</strong>. Design the <strong>basic ear shape and parts</strong>. Leave the <strong>other ear as a silhouette</strong>. Adjust the <strong>brow as needed</strong>.</p>

<h2>Final Adjustments</h2>

<p>Stop the drawing at this stage. Indicate the <strong>hair hat loosely</strong>. Build a sense of <strong>rhythm in the hair later</strong>. Begin <strong>lighting the drawing</strong>. For homework, establish the <strong>look of the features on the structure</strong>. Build <strong>robotic forms into lifelike qualities</strong>.</p>
