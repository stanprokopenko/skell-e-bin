<h2>Depth and Distance</h2>

<p>In drawing, <strong>the closer things are</strong>, the more the <strong>depth</strong> is exaggerated. Farther objects appear to <strong>flatten out</strong>. If you ignore this principle, you may be <strong>losing control</strong> of your spatial credibility without realizing it.</p>

<p>• <strong>Up close</strong>: Mountains can appear like entire worlds you can walk into.<br />

• <strong>Far away</strong>: Those same mountains turn into mere silhouettes.</p>

<p>Distance <strong>diminishes</strong> depth. Proximity <strong>amplifies</strong> it.</p>

<h2>Cameras and Lenses</h2>

<p>Cameras capture everything in a shot. Even if you zoom in on a subject, you still feel distant unless you change your actual position. Understanding how lenses work helps you draw <strong>different fields of view</strong> effectively.</p>

<h3>Wide vs. Long Lenses</h3>

<p>• <strong>Wide angle (short focal length)</strong> shows more of the scene. It can fit more objects from left to right and top to bottom, but it also makes distant objects look much smaller.<br />

• <strong>Long (telephoto) lenses</strong> narrow the angle and make faraway objects look bigger, cropping out more of the surroundings.</p>

<p>When you depend on a zoom lens, you crop and magnify the same space. But <strong>moving closer</strong> physically changes the relationship between objects in the space.</p>

<h2>Zooming vs. Moving</h2>

<p>• <strong>Zooming</strong>: The background and foreground remain in the same positions relative to each other. You just crop the view.<br />

• <strong>Moving in (tracking/dollying)</strong>: Objects shift and change their positions relative to each other. You feel like you’re entering the scene.</p>

<p>This difference matters if you’re telling a story in your drawings. For instance, Disney used multi-plane cameras to create a sense of <strong>truly moving in</strong>, not just zooming.</p>

<h2>Compression and Expansion of Space</h2>

<p>When something is far away and zoomed in, the foreground and background <strong>compress</strong> together. Move up close to that same subject, and the space <strong>expands</strong> so you’re more immersed. Apply this to a human face or a building, and you can create dramatic effects:</p>

<p>• <strong>Zoomed from afar</strong>: Objects look flattened, with less obvious foreshortening.<br />

• <strong>Moved up close</strong>: Diminution becomes clear. Differences in size from top to bottom or front to back become more exaggerated.</p>

<h2>Your Drawing Assignment</h2>

<p>Try experimenting with <strong>contrasting pairs</strong> of reference images, one up close, one far away. Pick a closeup view and draw it. Next, draw the <strong>far view</strong> from imagination. Then compare your second drawing to the reference photo, and see how well you captured the changes in space.</p>

<p>You can do the same exercise starting with the far shot, then <strong>imagine</strong> the close shot. Pay special attention to the <strong>foreground</strong>, <strong>background</strong>, and <strong>space in between</strong>. Notice what happens to vanishing points in two-point perspective: <strong>the closer to the object, the closer the vanishing points get</strong>. The farther away, the farther apart they go.</p>

<p>If you have a camera with multiple lenses, create your own reference sets. You’ll learn how <strong>moving</strong> vs. <strong>zooming</strong> affects spatial relationships.</p>

<h2>Field of Vision</h2>

<p>Humans have a wide, natural field of vision. Cameras depend on lenses, but you rely on <strong>eye sockets</strong>. When you want to recreate reality in a drawing with straight-line perspective, you’ll generally limit your field of view to about 60 or 90 degrees. To capture more, you use additional vanishing points or curved lines.</p>

<h2>Proximity in Action</h2>

<p>Observe how an artist shifts vantage points. For example, Winsor McCay drew one panel from far away, then another panel <strong>closer</strong> with a <strong>wider angle</strong> to see above and below. Notice how he emphasized the vertical and horizontal stretch to immerse you in the scene.</p>

<p>Proximity changes the way things look. You can use it to control how your audience views <strong>forms</strong>, <strong>depth</strong>, and <strong>spatial relationships</strong>.</p>

<h2>Looking Ahead</h2>

<p>In part two, you’ll focus on <strong>simplified forms</strong> and <strong>measuring</strong> them in space. You’ll learn to lock certain angles and ellipses in your mind so you can draw with confidence and clarity. This leads to a deeper mastery of <strong>form and space</strong>.</p>

<p>Keep practicing your <strong>proximity tricks</strong>, and remember to watch how objects expand or contract in your view. When you have an eye for it, you’ll choose the right lens, real or imagined, to communicate exactly what you want to show in your art.</p>
