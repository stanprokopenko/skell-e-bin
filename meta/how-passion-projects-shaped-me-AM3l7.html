<h2>Rediscovering Old Works</h2>

<p>While going through my old work, I found a box filled with miscellaneous projects. It included pieces from workshops with Max Turner and Glenn Vilppu, as well as some of my high school art.</p>

<h3>Max Turner's Workshop</h3>

<p>I had some drawings from Max Turner's workshop. He showed us a technique using textured papers. Here's an example of a piece I did during his class.</p>

<h3>Glenn Vilppu's Workshop</h3>

<p>I also found a big stack of gestures and other studies from Glenn Vilppu's class. These were probably from later on in my education.</p>

<h3>High School Art</h3>

<p>Underneath those, I found art from high school, even before I went to Watts Atelier. There were drawings of primitive shapes and setups my high school teacher put together. I also found a photo from my grandpa's album when he was in the Soviet army.</p>

<h2>Developing Unique Illustrations</h2>

<p>In 2002, I was working on a really weird turkey illustration. I did several layers to study different aspects:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Egg Placement</strong>: Figuring out how to place all the ovals.</li>

<li><strong>Value Study</strong>: Using four values to plan where the lightest lights would be and how the values transition throughout the piece.</li>

<li><strong>Movement and Composition</strong>: Thinking about eye tracking and how the composition guides the viewer's eye.</li>

<li><strong>Skeleton Details</strong>: Focusing on the details of the skeleton.</li>

</ul>

<p>All these studies came together into a larger drawing.</p>

<h3>Zoo Sketches and Collage</h3>

<p>I enjoyed going to the zoo and sketching animals. I tried composing these sketches into something that might look like a magazine spread or a National Geographic composition, focusing mainly on <strong>shape design</strong>.</p>

<h2>Experimenting with Mediums and Techniques</h2>

<h3>Early Paintings</h3>

<p>I found some oil paintings from high school, including caricatures of Gandhi and Lincoln from 2003 and 2004, my senior year.</p>

<p>I remembered learning a technique from a book before attending Watts Atelier. It was based entirely on using a <strong>blending stump</strong>. You'd put some tone down and then use a blending stump to soften it into shapes. Looking back, I don't like this technique anymore, but at the time, I was so proud of how the gradations turned out. It was good practice for working on subtle halftones and transitions.</p>

<h3>Still Lifes at Home</h3>

<p>I set up still lifes at home and tried painting without an instructor. One of them took me several days, but I think it came together pretty well.</p>

<h3>Advancing in Gouache</h3>

<p>Some of the gouache paintings I found were done later, maybe three years into Watts Atelier. The <strong>shape design</strong> is much better than in my previous high school paintings.</p>

<p>I did <strong>thumbnail value studies</strong> for these paintings. For example, I had a self-portrait as a kid and did little thumbnail value studies to decide on the composition and values. I experimented with different compositions, trying to figure out which one worked best.</p>

<p>Looking at these makes me really want to do more gouache paintings. Gouache is all about learning how to <strong>tile</strong>.</p>

<h3>Learning Through Mistakes</h3>

<p>Some of my early gouache paintings didn't turn out well because the tape destroyed the edges when I removed it. Later, I got the right paper, and the tape created a nice edge without ripping the paper apart.</p>

<h3>Caricatures and Experimentation</h3>

<p>I did a lot of caricatures, including one of my grandpa and one of his friends. They would meet up with friends to play checkers and cards. One day, I went with him and watched them play. When I got home, I did a caricature from memory.</p>

<p>I also did a value study from a picture of my mom's elementary school class, trying to simplify the gradation into four steps.</p>

<h2>Creating Larger Compositions</h2>

<h3>Gym Illustration</h3>

<p>I worked on a composition of a skinny guy going to the gym, looking at buff guys working out. I spent a long time on this, figuring out the composition and designing the light patterns. I even did photo shoots with a student from Watts Atelier to get reference images.</p>

<p>I exaggerated the anatomy, inventing muscles from books. This was a really useful exercise while learning anatomy in class and trying to apply it to something real and exciting.</p>

<p>I did <strong>value studies</strong> to figure out compositions, grouping values together in bigger compositions. All the quick sketches and two-value studies I did helped me understand how to group values in larger pieces.</p>

<h3>Experimenting with Charcoal on Toned Paper</h3>

<p>I experimented with different ways to apply <strong>white and black charcoal on toned paper</strong>. One approach was where the white and black never really mix, using the middle value of the paper itself. Another approach was overlapping the white and black in the lights, creating different color temperatures, the lights are cold, and the shadows are warm.</p>

<p>I applied this technique in a drawing where I chose to overlap the white and black in the lights, keeping the lights cold and the shadows warm.</p>

<h3>Self-Portraits and Studies</h3>

<p>I found a self-portrait from 2006, three years into Watts Atelier. I also had studies for the gym illustration, working on boxes to figure out perspectives and putting tones on top. There's the initial drawing, the first attempt, and then the final result, although unfinished.</p>

<h2>Weird Illustrations and Personal Explorations</h2>

<p>I came across some of my weird illustrations where I was trying to apply anatomy creatively. For example, a drawing of a skeletal person who is pregnant, trying to juxtapose <strong>life and death</strong>. Looking back, it's cringy, but at the time, I didn't care what people thought. I wish I still had that fearless mentality.</p>

<h3>Drapery Studies</h3>

<p>I did drapery studies from life on toned paper, using subtle <strong>cross contours</strong> with little highlights designed as cross-hatching lines.</p>

<h3>More Personal Projects</h3>

<p>Another illustration was of a drug addict sitting against a wall, trying to show the <strong>dark side of life</strong>. I also found a study for a painting I did later, from a trip to Ukraine with Jeff Watts. I composed several photos into a composition of men working with horses.</p>

<p>I did a study in the style of Steve Huston, either from his workshop or from studying his work online. This was a valuable exercise.</p>

<h2>The Importance of Personal Projects</h2>

<p>Many of these works were at-home projects I did outside of life drawing classes. I'd come back home and always have something I was working on. All these exercises and projects were about <strong>applying what I was learning</strong>, practicing techniques, and pursuing subjects that excited me.</p>

<p>That's all for this box of art. Let me know in the comments if you want to see more of my student work.</p>
