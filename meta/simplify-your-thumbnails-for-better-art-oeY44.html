<p>Hey everyone, welcome back! I'm going to dive into level two notan thumbnails. Last time, we did master studies, and this time, I'm looking at your still lifes. You set up your own still life and did notan thumbnails from them. Let's check them out.</p>

<h2>Jeff's Thumbnails</h2>

<h3>First Thumbnail</h3>

<p>Jeff, your first one is really nice. This is exactly correct. Here's your reference:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Lights and shadows:</strong> You have a lot of rim light on the orange and lemon.</li>

<li><strong>Table and background:</strong> Light on the table and shadow in the back.</li>

</ul>

<p>One risk with your setup is that the background might seem really light. While there are parts of it that are light, when I squint, overall it's much darker than the light on the table, and the tops of the fruits. You correctly identified the back as a dark, simplified it by removing all the detail, and just put light on the tops and shadow on these backs with a big cast shadow. Very simple composition, you did it exactly how I would have done it.</p>

<p>The only critique I have is that it's kind of large. It's not really a thumbnail. You unnecessarily spent a lot of time shading these values. While it's great practice to keep your values clean, when you're doing thumbnails and studying, it's probably better to move forward and do more of them instead of spending so much time on one. But that's a minor critique.</p>

<h3>Second Thumbnail</h3>

<p>The second one, I would have done a little differently. You grouped the entire light shape on all of these with the light of the table. What that does is two things that I think are bad:</p>

<ol>

<li><strong>You lose the outline.</strong> You lose the shape and separation between the table and some of the fruit.</li>

<li><strong>You lose the highlights.</strong> These highlights are more important than the information you're getting within the shadows.</li>

</ol>

<p>You're prioritizing the information in the shadows over the lights, and I typically would go the other way. Shadows can be grouped into one value, and the lights, the things that are illuminated, are where the eye should be focused. That's not always the case, but usually it is.</p>

<p>If you have three values, I would suggest putting one of them in the shadow, and two of them in the lights. So, I would have shifted the threshold so that the fruits are the middle value. The light on the fruit, all of this should be the middle value.</p>

<h4>Demonstration</h4>

<p>Let me try one here:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Simplify the shapes:</strong> I'm going to start really rough, fruit here, one here, and another one here.</li>

<li><strong>Background:</strong> I know this background is going to be all dark, so let's throw that in there.</li>

<li><strong>Shadows on the fruits:</strong> Identify the shadow sides.</li>

</ul>

<p>As I'm doing this, I'm trying to keep it very simple. I don't want to draw the apple, the orange, and the lemon, I want to just draw a very simple version of the shapes I'm seeing. This brings us back to the shape lessons, <strong>simplification</strong>.</p>

<p>Now, when I compare yours to this one, the darker masses of the fruit contrasted by the light surrounding them definitely make it feel like a group of fruits sitting on a table. They're a darker mass, and it brings my eye more into this area. Once I add the highlights, our eye goes to the focal point.</p>

<h2>Dave's Thumbnail</h2>

<p>Dave, this is a nice, interesting setup. You said, "I was apprehensive about setting up a still life, but it became quite fun after hunting around the house finding subject matter." It can be fun once you get into the motion. The challenge becomes fun. Sometimes, the hardest part is just getting to work. Once you start, your mind gets absorbed, and it's exciting.</p>

<h3>Critique</h3>

<p>At first, I thought you just posterized the image in Photoshop. You put so much detail into this that it does kind of look like a little bit of posterization happening there. That would be my first critique, you spent a little bit too much time on the details. This is not a thumbnail, you tried to go for a finish.</p>

<p>Make sure you know how to <strong>hold yourself back</strong> and do just a thumbnail, not a finished rendering. Thumbnails are incredibly valuable because you can explore ten different options. You're not going to be able to do that if you go this detailed.</p>

<p>Based on where you chose your thresholds, you did a very accurate job, maybe even too accurate. If you did this on your own, great, very accurate. But I want to explore another version because I think there's a case here to be made that we might want to keep our absolute lightest lights, that lightest value, for the focal areas in the composition.</p>

<h4>Alternative Approach</h4>

<p>Because you have it right now, you have a lot of noise going on in here, in this shadow, and that's really distracting. Also, the skull is kind of lost, it gets merged in with the background here, so it doesn't really stand out. So the case I want to make here is that it might be better if we,</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Shift the separation between the light and the mid.</strong> ** Bring it closer to the light family so that we have fewer lights in our composition, leaving room for just a few lights, which are the skull, the edge of the vase, and the flowers.</li>

<li><strong>Simplify the details.</strong> ** Get rid of any highlights on the platform - it's really just mids and darks.</li>

<li><strong>Focus on the focal points.</strong> Just a few indications of the flowers and stuff, and then final detail is we have these bright lights on the flowers.</li>

</ul>

<p>By pushing that background back, it allows the highlights on the skull and the vase to really pop forward. This gives more depth to the whole picture.</p>

<h2>Leva's Thumbnail</h2>

<p>Leva, you did a really nice version of this mannequin. When I squint at it, I see:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Light and dark shapes:</strong> Lots of these vertical, staggered light and dark lines.</li>

<li><strong>Diagonals:</strong> The arm cutting through diagonally on both sides.</li>

<li><strong>Additional elements:</strong> A little bit of light on the top of the cactus.</li>

</ul>

<p>Everything else is shadow, and the leg comes through. You did a good job identifying these shapes. The only difference is that this entire pot, I do see some glow in here, but when you squint, it's still all shadow. So I would have made this entire shape over here a shadow as well. But everything else looks good. I'm happy with your decisions. Good job.</p>

<h2>Theum's Thumbnail</h2>

<p>Wow. Very detailed. You put a lot of time and effort into this, probably a little bit too much for a thumbnail. Beautiful drawing though. Great job on this.</p>

<h3>Critique</h3>

<p>Again, it's a thumbnail. **Do five of them instead of one really nice one. ** You used too much gradation, you're starting to render. For these notan two-to-three-value thumbnails, I would try to force yourself to decide where the edge of that is. Even though the whole thing in the background is a gradation, I would decide what that shape is.</p>

<p>Yes, it's a very blurry edge to that dark shape in the corner, but still, what is the shape? <strong>Force yourself to give it a hard edge</strong> to determine what the shape is. Then, when you do your longer rendering, you can give it the accurate edge. But right now, focus on the shape itself.</p>

<p>I'm happy that you put this entire stack of blocks into dark. Even though I do see variations in the values here, when I squint, it's all very dark, and you did that. So, great job.</p>

<p>Just watch out for too much detail and probably too many gradations for a thumbnail.</p>

<h2>Connie's Thumbnails</h2>

<h3>Apples</h3>

<p>With the apples, I think it's the same critique that I gave at the beginning. <strong>You added three values but chose to add that separation within the shadows</strong>, and that didn't really communicate much. I would have made these little cuties a mid-value, maybe even the other fruit as well.</p>

<p>What that does is it <strong>separates them from the background</strong>. Then, when you put in your shadows, the shadows give form to the apples. There's a gradation in the background, the right side is much darker than the left, so you can decide on a shape to put in.</p>

<h3>Flowers</h3>

<p>Kind of similar. I see what you're doing, you grouped all the flowers as a light value. But when I squint, it seems more of a mid-tone. I do like your choice to bring it forward, it'll pop forward away from the background leaves. So I'm okay with this.</p>

<p>Also, when I adjusted the levels, it became a lot more clear that you put this whole background area as a mid-tone. When you shade, just make sure you have a really clean tone, no scratchy stuff. <strong>Clean value separations.</strong> **</p>

<h3>Tree</h3>

<p>In your tree, I think it's the same thing. When I first look at it, everything is so light that it's hard to see the difference between your mid-tone and your lights. <strong>Push this to a bigger range</strong> and then clean up the mids so it doesn't have a lot of the light showing through.</p>

<p>Simplify and group shapes together more. You tried to retain a little bit too much detail for a thumbnail, and you've lost a lot of that dark mass, like this is one solid tree. That's just because a lot of your detail, the sky coming through, those shapes were just too big, too light, and so it overpowered the darkness of the tree itself.</p>

<h3>Clarity</h3>

<p>Clarity, that's the big critique here. More clear shapes. When you're doing the thumbnail, just make sure you're really separating those values. Remember that you're communicating. Every picture you're doing, you're communicating something to the viewer. If that communication feels like a little bit of a whisper, there needs to be a reason why you're whispering. A whisper can be powerful, but only when it's in the right context. In some of these cases, I think you guys are whispering unintentionally, and that can get in the way of telling a more powerful story with more drama.</p>

<h2>Jayoshi and Rachel's Advice</h2>

<p>I also want to point out, so Jayoshi has this really beautiful photo. I'm not sure if you took that photo, but if you did, great job. It's a beautiful composition. Your studies lack a little bit of that clarity.</p>

<p>Rachel did a really nice tutorial for you guys. I just wanted to point it out here because it communicates what I've been saying. She gives you options:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>What do you like about this subject?</strong> Do you like the items on the plate?</li>

</ul>

<p>A lot of you have been choosing the lighting and sacrificing the objects. In her version, with two values, I can see how you can go either direction, and they are both fine. When you add that third value, you can have both, you can communicate the lighting by having a separation between the shadows and the fruits, and you can communicate the separation between the outline of the fruits and the background behind them.</p>

<p>When you only have one value separation to choose from, you have to pick either lighting or items on the plate. The mistake a lot of you have been making is that when you choose lighting as the main thing and then you add a third value, you're adding it in the shadows. Now you're not getting this other thing that is really important. Instead, you're capturing some information within the shadows that isn't that important for showing the lighting and the items on the plate.</p>

<p><strong>Every time you add a value, you can communicate the next most important thing.</strong> So you have to choose what is the most important thing to communicate, and then what is the next important thing if you get another value.</p>

<p>You have to be very clear in your decisions, communicating with simple shapes, no detail, just very big decisions of what it is.</p>

<h2>Breakfast's Thumbnails</h2>

<h3>Great Job</h3>

<p>You did a good job. With the two values, this is exactly how I would have done it as well. Wonderful.</p>

<h3>Questions</h3>

<p>You have some questions:</p>

<h4>How Much Time Should I Spend on These?</h4>

<p>I like to start with quicker thumbnails, really small, and simplify them a lot. For the first ones, they could be one minute to five minutes. It really depends. Anything longer than that, I think you're either drawing too big, or you're putting too much detail into it.</p>

<p>Then, once you go a little bit bigger, you can spend up to ten minutes. That allows you to think through your decisions a little bit more, get that shape just right, and make sure your proportions are correct. You don't want to quickly scribble it in and it's not clear.</p>

<p>Your thumbnails show that you're putting a lot of time into making sure your shapes are designed well, which is good. This is exactly what you should be spending that time on.</p>

<h4>How Do I Approach Dark Colors Within Light and Light Colors?</h4>

<p>Not sure what you mean by that. Maybe you're talking about a floating dark shape within a lot of light? If that's what you mean, then it depends on how important that floating shape is. If it's really small and not important, I just take it out, it's a detail, so you can ignore it. But if it's a floating dark shape and it's really important, like a bird flying through the sky and it's small but an important detail, I would put it in.</p>

<p>It depends on the context and what you're communicating. If you put that dark shape in, does it add to the composition or does it distract?</p>

<h4>How Much Detail Should Go Into the Shape Design?</h4>

<p>Not much, just enough to be able to figure out your value compositions. When I look at yours, it's great. You're at a great level of simplicity while still maintaining the context of what it is you're drawing. You've removed all the unnecessary details, and I can still see what it is.</p>

<h2>Shefali's Thumbnails</h2>

<h3>Fruits</h3>

<p>As for the fruits, same critique as some of the others. You added three values but chose to add that separation within the shadows, and that didn't really communicate much. I would have made these fruits the mid-value.</p>

<h3>Rocks with Sunlight</h3>

<p>This one is a little bit different. I have a similar critique. You've grouped the lights and the background behind them as the same value, and a lot of your separation is happening in this area, which I would not have emphasized.</p>

<p>I think the power in this comes from when I squint, the sun shining on the tops of these rocks. A lot of this decoration within the shadows is interesting, but when I squint, it's gone. I would capture that as subtle things within the shadows, as detail you see later, but not as the first thing you see.</p>

<p>Let me show you:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Shadow areas:</strong> The right side is mostly shadow.</li>

<li><strong>Mid-values:</strong> The grass and stuff behind the rocks is mostly mid.</li>

<li><strong>Light planes:</strong> The light planes on the rocks getting hit by light are the most important things.</li>

</ul>

<p>By prioritizing clarity here and big block shapes, I decided that the light planes of these rocks are the most important things. To really show that and highlight that, I have to make sure they separate and there's a lot of contrast between them and everything behind them.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p>Thank you, everybody. Great job on your notan studies. In the next project, we're going to go further into composition and really think about how our choices change what our pictures communicate, not just studying the value, but exploring versions of values and trying to change it. We will try to see what we can do to be artists rather than just copying. Thank you for sticking around. I'll see you in the next one.</p>
