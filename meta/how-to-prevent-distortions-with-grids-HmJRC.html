<p>Welcome to our review of your work on using grids to help with <strong>line directions</strong> while focusing on <strong>proportions</strong> from your orthos. Let's dive into the key lessons from your submissions.</p>

<h2>Grids and Line Directions</h2>

<p>Grids are meant to <strong>guide us</strong> with line directions, but some of you got creative and faced challenges. Remember, grids can <strong>restrict</strong> us, but that's the point, they help maintain accuracy.</p>

<p><strong>Tip:</strong> Always ask yourself <strong>which part is closest</strong> and <strong>which is distant</strong>, including up and down, to ensure your lines converge correctly.</p>

<h2>Common Mistakes</h2>

<p>Some of you inadvertently used the grid <strong>backward</strong>, causing lines to diverge instead of converging toward a vanishing point. If lines are going away from the closest corner, they should aim toward a vanishing point, not away.</p>

<h2>Daring to Foreshorten</h2>

<p>I encourage you to <strong>dare to foreshorten</strong>. It's challenging because it goes against what we know, but it's essential for creating dynamic drawings.</p>

<p>For example, drawing objects like <strong>wire cutters or cannons</strong> in a foreshortened position can look odd if not proportioned correctly. When an object is close to us, the parts closer should appear <strong>larger</strong>, and those further away should appear <strong>smaller</strong>. Ensure your boxes or grids reflect this to avoid distortion.</p>

<h2>Understanding Perspective and Distortion</h2>

<p>Be mindful of <strong>wide-angle perspectives</strong> and the <strong>field of vision</strong>. When vanishing points are too close or grids are too wide, distortion occurs.</p>

<p><strong>Tip:</strong> If your drawing looks distorted, check if your vanishing points are too close. Spreading them out can reduce distortion.</p>

<h2>Estimating Proportions</h2>

<p>Learning to see proportions by <strong>comparing back and forth</strong> between your drawing and ortho references is crucial. It's similar to how we learned to walk, through <strong>trial and error</strong>. Trust your intuition, if it doesn't look right, adjust it.</p>

<p><strong>Remember:</strong> You're not measuring proportions yet, you're <strong>estimating</strong> them as a preparation for measuring.</p>

<h2>Drawing Through and Rough Sketches</h2>

<p>Don't be afraid to <strong>draw through</strong> your forms. Drawing the parts that are not visible helps you understand the object's structure better. </p>

<p>Also, embrace <strong>rough sketches</strong> and preliminary lines. They are essential steps in refining your drawings.</p>

<h2>Handling Complexity</h2>

<p>If you're tackling highly developed or complex objects, know that it's a tough challenge. You might encounter more mistakes, but that's part of the learning process. Consider starting with <strong>simpler objects</strong> to build your foundational skills.</p>

<h2>Dealing with Grids</h2>

<p>Grids can be overwhelming if they have too many lines. You only need enough lines to <strong>guide you</strong>. If the grids confuse you, focus on the essential lines that help with direction.</p>

<p><strong>Tip:</strong> Ignore unnecessary grid lines initially and refer to them when you need guidance.</p>

<h2>Embracing the Learning Process</h2>

<p>Learning to draw accurately involves <strong>trial and error</strong>. Don't be discouraged by mistakes. Every attempt improves your perception and skill. Remember, even if it feels challenging now, with practice, it will become easier.</p>

<p>Thank you for your dedication and hard work. Keep experimenting, stay patient with yourself, and continue to <strong>dare to foreshorten</strong>. I'm excited to see your progress in the next lesson.</p>
