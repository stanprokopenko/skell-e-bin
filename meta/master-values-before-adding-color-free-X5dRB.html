<h2>What's in Premium?</h2>

<p>In this lesson, we'll explore how to add local colors and refine values in grayscale illustrations. We'll start by establishing local values using tools like the lasso and fill to create separate shapes for different areas like the face, hair, and eyes. You'll learn how to adjust your drawing by refining shapes and making tweaks on separate layers.</p>

<p>We'll cover the use of multiply layers to separate lights and darks, simulating lighting scenarios to enhance depth. Using clipping masks, we'll keep our painting organized and within the lines, allowing for clean edges and efficient adjustments. You'll learn to define shadow shapes with the lasso tool, focusing on natural shadows cast by features like the nose, lips, and hair.</p>

<p>We'll discuss techniques for merging and adjusting layers to make broader changes to the expression and silhouette. By focusing on gradients and values, you'll learn to suggest form and refine your grayscale work in preparation for colorization. The lesson will guide you through the process of introducing color to your piece while preserving the value structure using layer modes like Color, Multiply, and Overlay.</p>
