<h2>Getting Limber</h2>

<p>Welcome back! Let's get our hands limber and ready to draw some <strong>gestural limbs</strong>. By now, you've developed muscle memory, and we're going to use that as the <strong>genesis of everything</strong> in our drawings.</p>

<h2>Simplifying with Mnemonics</h2>

<p>I often use <strong>mnemonics</strong> to simplify complex forms. Instead of thinking about the rib cage as a complex thoracic structure with manubriums and sternums, I think of it as a <strong>tube with an egg around it</strong>. Simple shapes like the <strong>Liberty Bell</strong> for the pelvis help us remember and draw quickly.</p>

<h2>Capturing Flow Over Structure</h2>

<p>We want to <strong>shake off the shackles of structure</strong>. While structure is important, we don't want to show the mechanics overtly. Focus on the <strong>flow and gesture</strong> of the figure. Keep it <strong>long, light, and loose</strong>.</p>

<h2>Understanding Pinch and Stretch</h2>

<p>When drawing poses, observe where the body <strong>pinches</strong> and <strong>stretches</strong>. If an arm is raised and the scapula tilts, there's a pinch on one side and a stretch on the other. This awareness adds life to your drawings.</p>

<h2>The Power of Practice</h2>

<p>The key is <strong>mileage</strong>, drawing repeated patterns from different angles. The more you draw, the more these forms become second nature. Practice helps you overcome challenges, whether it's hands, forearms, or the scapula.</p>

<h2>Expressive Lines with the Underhand Grip</h2>

<p>Try using the <strong>underhand grip</strong> to create <strong>expressive marks</strong>. This allows for a range of motion and helps achieve fluidity in your lines. You can make broad strokes that aren't possible with the traditional writing grip.</p>

<h2>Incorporating Story and Emotion</h2>

<p>Ask yourself, <strong>what is the character thinking?</strong> Giving your figures a story or emotion adds depth. Themes like love, loneliness, or joy can inform your drawing and make it more engaging.</p>

<h2>Learning from Art History</h2>

<p>Reflect on the works of great artists. I was inspired by comic book artists like <strong>John Buscema</strong> and <strong>Jack Kirby</strong>. Looking back further, consider ancient art like the <strong>Venus of Willendorf</strong>. 28,000 years ago, people were creating art filled with emotion and meaning.</p>

<h2>Embracing Simplicity</h2>

<p><strong>Simplicity is the most important thing</strong>. Remove unnecessary details to let the magic shine through. It's not about showing off all the mechanics but conveying the essence of the figure.</p>

<h2>Experimenting and Enjoying the Process</h2>

<p>Don't be afraid to try different poses and <strong>explore all avenues</strong>. Even if a drawing doesn't turn out perfectly, it leads to the next, better drawing. Enjoy the journey and keep practicing.</p>
