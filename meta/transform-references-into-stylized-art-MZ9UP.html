<p>Hey, I’m Ben, and I love to draw, paint, and sculpt more stylized art. In this lesson, I’m walking through my process of using a photo reference without sticking too closely to it. My goal is to capture only the important parts of the photo, then push and pull the design to create a unique stylized character.</p>

<h2>Sketching and Basic Shapes</h2>

<p>I begin with a <strong>simple shape</strong> or silhouette that grabs my attention. I’m not tied to the reference, so I let my imagination lead. Once I have a loose shape for the head, I block in the <strong>neck, ear, and nose</strong> as more or less <em>2D shapes</em>. I find it freeing to bounce around the face, sketching the eyes, lips, and hair, while staying loose and not committing to details too early.</p>

<p>I like to <strong>flip the canvas horizontally</strong> from time to time. It helps me spot any big mistakes and keeps my shapes balanced.</p>

<h2>Thinking in 2D and 3D</h2>

<p>I often slide between <strong>2D and 3D thinking</strong>. For example, a nose can be imagined as a simple triangular or cylindrical shape. By treating forms as <strong>basic volumes</strong>, I get a better sense of how light will wrap around them. I also like to break the head into planes so I know where I’m going to place light and shadow.</p>

<h2>Line Refinement</h2>

<p>After my rough blocking, I reduce the <strong>opacity</strong> of my sketch layer and <strong>trace over</strong> it more confidently. In this stage, I make sure the face looks cohesive and that I understand the planes enough to shade. I keep my strokes more decisive, still allowing for edits like warping, liquifying, and adjusting shapes.</p>

<h2>Establishing Values</h2>

<p>Next, I lay down <strong>base values</strong> in black and white. I’ll use the lasso tool and fill areas of the hair and face with different local values. To keep each region separate, I put them on <strong>different layers</strong> (sometimes using clipping masks). Once I establish local values, I add a <strong>multiply layer</strong> on top to figure out my areas of light and shadow. </p>

<p>I like to simulate a <strong>top-down lighting scenario</strong> so the ear, upper lip, and beneath the nose will catch shadows. As I block shadows, I stop relying on the photo reference. I trust my constructed forms and let them guide my shading.</p>

<h2>Using the Filthy Plugin (Optional Speed Boost)</h2>

<p>I sometimes use a Photoshop plugin my friend and I developed called the <strong>Filthy Plugin</strong>. It speeds up tasks like lasso-filling, erasing, and adding shapes. But you can do the same things with the regular lasso, paint bucket, or brush tools. It just helps me work faster.</p>

<h2>Building Up Gradients and Adjusting Shapes</h2>

<p>I make selections with the lasso tool and use gradients or an <strong>airbrush</strong> to suggest form. I keep my edges rather hard at first, since everything is still quite rough. I check my shapes, merge layers if I want to make big changes, and then push or pull features for more attitude, expression, or appeal.</p>

<h2>Adding Color</h2>

<p>Once I’m happy with my values in grayscale, I add <strong>color layers</strong>. I set the layer mode to <strong>Color</strong> and pick a base skin color. Then I adjust saturation or hue until I like the look. I do the same for the hair, maybe experimenting with contrasting colors (warm skin, cool hair, or vice versa).</p>

<h3>Color Variation</h3>

<p>I create extra layers set to <strong>Multiply</strong> or <strong>Overlay</strong> to introduce color variation in the skin and hair. I push reds in the nose, ears, and cheeks for a more lifelike look, and sometimes cool down the shadows for a bit of contrast. A bit of <em>freckles</em> or subtle color shifts go a long way in making it interesting.</p>

<h2>Highlights and Shadows</h2>

<p>To introduce <strong>highlights</strong>, I’ll use <strong>Screen</strong> or <strong>Color Dodge</strong> layers. Light is often strongest on areas like the nose, forehead, and inner corners of the eyes. I’ll also hint at <strong>subsurface scattering</strong> by painting saturated reds in places where light might pass through the skin (like the nostrils or ears).</p>

<p>For the <strong>hair</strong>, I might add an extra top-facing highlight. I often mask out shapes to create bolder outlines or stray hair strands. The <strong>lasso and a soft brush</strong> let me define edges quickly.</p>

<h2>Final Refinements</h2>

<p>Once the main colors and lighting are in place, I merge my layers again and do normal painting on a single layer. This is where I add subtle transitions, refine lines, and tweak the mood. Sometimes I’ll:</p>

<p>• Darken the background for contrast.<br />

• Paint in stray hairs for a more natural look.<br />

• Adjust the silhouette to keep it appealing.  </p>

<p>At this point, my stylized portrait is set, and I can go as far as I want, either a finished painting or something looser.</p>

<p>I hope this breakdown helps you understand how to stylize a reference without relying too rigidly on it. The trick is balancing <strong>basic shapes, clear values, and experimental color</strong> to bring your character to life.</p>
