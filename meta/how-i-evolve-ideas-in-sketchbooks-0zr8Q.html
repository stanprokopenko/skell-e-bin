<p>Hello! I'm Faith, an artist working in animation, comics, and freelance illustration. You might know me for my fantasy artwork featuring girls with swords, that's basically my vibe. Today, I'd like to share three of my sketchbooks and how they contribute to my creative process.</p>

<h2>The Planning Sketchbook</h2>

<p>This is my actual sketchbook where I plan everything I'm going to do. I thumbnail ideas, explore compositions, and jot down new concepts. It's not the prettiest, but it's where the groundwork happens.</p>

<p>I prefer working on <strong>gridded paper</strong> in this sketchbook. The grids help me compose shots by literally counting the squares, making it easier to plan out compositions like an 11 by 17 frame. The structure also encourages me not to fuss over details, I'm down to business here.</p>

<h3>Project Development</h3>

<p>In this sketchbook, I've planned projects like:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Tarot card illustrations</strong> for a 3D Total book, where each artist illustrated one suit. The compositions stayed mostly the same when I finished them digitally.</li>

<li><strong>Mythological pieces</strong> like "The Birth of Venus," "Sleeping Beauty," and "The Little Mermaid." I explore different ways to approach these themes.</li>

<li><strong>Character designs</strong> for potential projects, like a labyrinth inspired by the Minotaur myth, or a werewolf character who's nervous and not threatening.</li>

<li><strong>Series ideas</strong>, such as seasonal illustrations of a dragon hunter, where I explore settings like tall grass with dragons passing by.</li>

</ul>

<p>Sometimes, the sketches here directly inspire finished pieces. For instance, a drawing of a woman with a hunting horn leading hounds became one of my favorite watercolor illustrations.</p>

<h2>The Relaxation Sketchbook</h2>

<p>This is my <strong>"no thoughts, head empty"</strong> sketchbook. I use a Pentel waterproof ink brush and markers, drawing whatever comes to me while sitting on the couch watching TV. It's more about stream-of-consciousness and having fun.</p>

<h3>Creative Exploration</h3>

<p>In this sketchbook, I often:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Chase ideas</strong> that intrigue me, like Daphne turning into a tree from Greek mythology.</li>

<li><strong>Develop recurring themes</strong>, such as fairies and monster girls.</li>

<li><strong>Experiment with costumes</strong> and character designs.</li>

<li><strong>Refine concepts</strong> that might inspire future works, like a harpy series representing the seasons or a mermaid piece.</li>

</ul>

<p>Some drawings here unexpectedly lead to finished works. For example, a sketch inspired a foil print series of bird girls for each season.</p>

<h2>The Travel Sketchbook</h2>

<p>I also keep <strong>travel sketchbooks</strong> filled with drawings from life or photos I've taken during trips. Drawing from life helps me remember the sensory experiences more vividly.</p>

<h3>Capturing Experiences</h3>

<p>During my trip to Japan, I sketched:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Cats at a Tokyo cat café</strong> while waiting to check into my hotel.</li>

<li><strong>Trees, bridges, and statues</strong> in Nikko and other parks.</li>

<li><strong>Food and street scenes</strong> in Yokohama and Osaka, including a Minions churro and themed café treats.</li>

<li><strong>Shrines and natural landscapes</strong>, stopping frequently to sketch while hiking.</li>

<li><strong>Gesture drawings</strong> at a unique bar, capturing poses from the staff.</li>

</ul>

<p>These sketches not only document my travels but also inspire future art. Experiencing the intense colors in nature, like the vibrant yellows of ginkgo trees, has influenced how I think about color in my work.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p>Each of my sketchbooks serves a different purpose:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Planning</strong>: For developing ideas and projects.</li>

<li><strong>Relaxation</strong>: For free-flowing creativity without pressure.</li>

<li><strong>Travel</strong>: For capturing experiences and inspirations on the go.</li>

</ul>

<p>Together, they contribute to my growth as an artist, helping me explore ideas, refine techniques, and find inspiration in everyday moments.</p>
