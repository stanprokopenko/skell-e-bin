<h2>Setting Up the Grid</h2>

<p>All right, another late night. I'm going to put this airplane in <strong>one-point perspective</strong>. I just tried it, but it's not foreshortened enough. Let's try again.</p>

<p>I started to make it in two-point perspective, but it took away part of what I wanted, to get this thing facing right at us. Since these first lines, this first grid, make all the difference in the world for how much it will be foreshortened, I'm proposing that we foreshorten it like this with a one-point grid so we can keep track of everything.</p>

<p>We'll need this to spread out further because we're going to have wings out here. It's not a bad idea to include more grid lines than one may need.</p>

<h2>Dividing the Plane into Sections</h2>

<p>Here's what we're going to do. We're going to try to estimate that the airplane is in <strong>three parts</strong>, but actually, it's not three equal parts. The first two parts are equal, and the last part is longer than the other three parts. Estimating that is no small task if you're not used to it. I'm used to it, and I think it's no small task.</p>

<p>I'm going to say that's the first third. I'm going to say that's the second third. The reason that's the second third is that <strong>last third is a long third</strong>.</p>

<p>I didn't grid in the vertical lines because I figured verticals are easy, but I'd better put them in. When you're in the grid, it can be difficult to discern. Vertical lines will help me adjust.</p>

<p>So, freehand verticals, a right-angled box in one-point perspective with a square front. We'll do the same thing we did before. We'll look at that front, compare it to the orthographic view, and say that it has about this much inset.</p>

<h2>Drawing the Front and Back Planes</h2>

<p>Before we can connect the dots, we can connect them on the front here and make sure it stays square-ish. Maybe a little vertical there. Then take the section all the way through. That's actually <strong>two squares back, two cubes back</strong>.</p>

<p>You might say it looks like a single cube. Yeah, it does. But we're going to find out when we get to wide-angle lenses that one square, two squares, three squares, four squares are all surprisingly relative.</p>

<p>Look what I've got to do. I've got to fix that line and make it converge more. That's a little better.</p>

<p>Now, the second section is the same as the first. Used to be a Herman's Hermits song, **"Second verse, same as the first." ** It's part of my childhood, it may not be important to you.</p>

<p>Two cubes, two cubes. The center of that cube, the center of those two cubes, is where the ellipse is, which I'm estimating. If you're a beginner, don't freak out. You'll learn everything you need to know in time about how to place that dome on there. In the meantime, you can just say, "One of these days."</p>

<p>Now we've got to get to the back. Let's see how we're doing if we drop that line down and run from here to here. Not too good, not too bad.</p>

<p>All right, there is a structure, rough-hewn though it may be. Now, on that back plane, we found that it was in about that. We're drawing on the back plane. Down about less than that. Down about that. Up about that. And about that shape.</p>

<p>Hey, now we can do it. I think we've learned enough where I can go in there now with a dark and precise line. Heavy enough that I'm going to have to erase over it, and I think it'll be heavy enough to tolerate the erasing.</p>

<h2>Adding the Dome</h2>

<p>Now I've got to go from that point to that point over there and make it with little guesswork. Look at how tapered the back is. Now we can go from this point. Look how confusingly it overlaps with the right-angled line over here.</p>

<p>No confusion about that. This has all been carved away and turned into open air. And this has also obviously been carved away, turned into open air. But here, as up here, we've got the same thing that could confuse. But of course, that line is over on the other side, so we don't want to darken it.</p>

<p>Then we can make our dark vertical and the other dark vertical and the horizontal contour. Since this is a very slight plane break, we'll include that line. The reason we care is that <strong>we are going to put a center to place that pointed cone out of there</strong>, and it's going to come from there. Therefore, we may want to run a vertical through the center and a horizontal through the center. Those help us orient where we are, and here's why we care.</p>

<p>From that, we'll go to a halfway point here, which is pretty easy to estimate. Whatever that is, it would be about the same. There's another way to get it, but I think that works. Then these two dots, then this dot over here and this one here, coming together rather rapidly.</p>

<p>For the dome, it would be wise to get out a template. I'm venturing into dangerous waters of distortion, but let's do the thing. Let's go to this plane, which was two squares back and two squares back again, and right there in the center would be a halfway line. Then run from the vanishing point through that center.</p>

<p>Well, it's not quite landing where we wanted it to. I'm going to go ahead and go with my first intent. I'm going to go with my instinct rather than instruments here. It would take a very discerning eye to notice that in the finished piece.</p>

<p>Notice we're not looking down on that dome as much as we were in the previous view.</p>

<p>All right, that is the body of the plane.</p>

<h2>Constructing the Tail</h2>

<p>Let's start at the back, like we did before. Let's find a center area, and look at how far forward that tail comes. It's about a third of the way, let's see, one, two, so it's way back there.</p>

<p>That's part of the wide-angle effect: <strong>things up close get really big, and things far back get really small</strong>.</p>

<p>We bring up the tail, and we know that it is significantly higher than the top of the dome. <strong>The height of that tail is diminishing. It's not as tall as it would be here, but it is not foreshortening. It is on a line that has no vanishing point.</strong></p>

<p>So let's bring it up that high, I think. And now we can run from... Oh, look how foreshortened that tail is. This has now got to go up to something less than halfway. So an extremely thin sliver of the side plane of the tail.</p>

<p>We'll do the trick where we dab at the fluff that we made use of. That line is vertical. That line is not vertical. That line is not vertical. That might need to be a little less looking down. But I don't know that we should fuss with it now. I think that could be when we're done because we want to get to this business of where to place the back wings.</p>

<h2>Adding the Stabilizing Wings</h2>

<p>Stabilizing wings run right across the top plane. So we can go back there. These were the easy ones, as you recall, because we can start at the top and figure that they are about <strong>as wide as this is tall</strong>. So I'd bring this one out to here, and I'd bring the other one out equally. It might even take a moment to see what equal is.</p>

<p>And then, if that's how far it will come out, we can run the line back, run the line forward. How far forward? Certainly not that far because the back wing will start there and run less than halfway back.</p>

<p>Let's do what we do: make it a rectangular wing to begin with, and then say let's take it back that far. Run over to the other side, take it back that far, then refine the line. I know it's getting a little messy in there, but I'm following it, and I trust you are.</p>

<p>Now we make this thickness, that thickness. That is not an X line, that is an <strong>XZ vector</strong>. And I think we have it precise enough for visual estimating.</p>

<p>Did we do it? I think we did. I still want to check the length before. Sometimes you don't trust your instruments because if it doesn't look right, if it's correct and it doesn't look correct, that is not a good thing. But sometimes we solve the problem by getting out the instruments.</p>

<p>Still feels... Oh, I think that's just the illusion of how it happens. It's feeling as if the other one is too thin. But it may be the illusion.</p>

<h2>Adding the Main Wings</h2>

<p>All right. <strong>Big wings</strong>. We know that the big wings are aiming directly back at the vanishing point. Look at how foreshortened they will get.</p>

<p>What about the one on the other side? Here's why we did this. It would be almost wise to have color coded it. The other wing, we can find its origin. It's very confusing here. But confusing or not, let's make these wings rectangular to begin with.</p>

<p>Remember, <strong>the length of the plane is the length of the wing</strong>. I thought I was going too far out here with my grid. I see now that that was wise because these are not foreshortened, or barely.</p>

<p>Let's remember we're starting from the base, not the top of the wing. And we want to take it from there all the way out to where it would go. So that is a long base. That's the back base.</p>

<p>Look at how that angle, which we would never dare to do that if we had not had a grid to tell us to. And again, from the base and from the base.</p>

<p>And if that works, we can now lift up. Lift up on the back. Lift up on the back. Here's the top. It will go directly back there to the vanishing point. It's a pure <strong>Z-line</strong>.</p>

<p>How far? We decided I think it was about halfway. So right there. Right there. And we're thinking through. The base goes from there to there. And I went a little too thick on that point, I think. But we're getting a structure. We will clean it up.</p>

<p>That point will connect to, where is it? This point. So we're trying to get this point and this one together. Sorry that they're wobbly, but the only problem with the wobble is that there's a little drunkenness between the two points. There is no ambiguity about which two points we are going from and to.</p>

<h2>Refining the Drawing</h2>

<p>Now, when we darken in this line and lighten up the ones that would not be visible, it'd be nice to get that in a single clean swoop of a line. And if I clean it up later, I'll make it a clean swoop of a line with a straight edge.</p>

<p>Graham Booth used to say that if you have to use a straight edge to make a straight line, that's fine. And there were people who had practiced their straight lines by freehand, and they were so proud of it. And when they would prove their prowess by making freehand straight lines, somebody else would come along with a ruler and say, "I can do the same thing with a ruler."</p>

<p>But it's not the same. And of course, they're right. <strong>A beautiful freehand straight line done in a single swoop has grace and elegance, and elegance separates an artist from the cheap rabble of those who rely on straight edges.</strong> But I haven't used any straight edges here, so I shouldn't feel guilty.</p>

<h2>Using Freehand vs. Instruments</h2>

<p>Notice that this square started out as the bigger square, but I was able to taper it in without losing my position. I want to make a small, maybe not that small, small circle. Trying to estimate what would happen if that comes... Now that point on the other one, the point got out here.</p>

<p>When we look at this thing from the top, I think that point is so foreshortened that it does not make it out of the surrounding ellipse of the base of that cone.</p>

<p>Man, this is dangerous to try to make an ellipse in slow motion, and it may not be a good influence on you when I tell you: <strong>Do freehand ellipses. Don't do them slow and careful.</strong> And you'll say, "I can just use an ellipse template and get it perfect." And I'll say, <strong>"It's not the same."</strong></p>

<h2>Final Touches</h2>

<p>Okay, that's going to aim down to there in a straight line. That's going to aim over to there in a straight line. And with pure cross-contours, no shading, we've defined it.</p>

<p>I think this deserves a little dessert of a straight edge. I think it needs the great big B. Oh, look how professional. <strong>My father would be proud.</strong></p>

<p>Well, we concerned ourselves first with <strong>a set of lines that let us know where up, down, left, right, front, back were</strong>. Then we concerned ourselves with <strong>proportion and how to divide up a right-angle box</strong>. And then <strong>we put our object into that box and carved away as needed</strong>.</p>

<p>And if that's looking odd, which it still is to me, I think I know why. I think I know why. When I took a ride on this line, that's what happened.</p>

<p>That's the advantage of having a very accurate grid as opposed to a loose one. But however you do it is up to you for your object. If you are doing something as tight and linear as a blocked-up airplane like this, you may want a more accurate grid. If you are doing something more like a plush toy, it's probably not that important.</p>

<p>But I hope you learned from that. Now go and do thou likewise.</p>
