<h2>Balancing Simplicity and Character</h2>

<p>I like to start by aiming for a <strong>simple structure</strong>, and I make sure it still captures <strong>essential characteristics</strong>. If we go too realistic, we risk overcomplicating, but if we make it too simple, we get a snowman-like figure. My goal is to find a <strong>balanced approach</strong> that’s quick to sketch, yet reads as a believable torso right from the start, before any rendering details.</p>

<h2>Building Blocks</h2>

<p>I begin with a <strong>basic rectangular or tubular shape</strong> for the torso. This shape should be <strong>waist-wide</strong> so I have room to adjust later. If I’m looking for slightly more nuance, I’ll define two main sections:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Rib Cage</strong>: Often about three units tall and two units wide.  </li>

<li><strong>Pelvis (hips)</strong>: About two units tall and three units wide.</li>

</ul>

<p>By separating these two sections, I keep the construction simple. It is also more characteristic. I also maintain a small gap between rib cage and pelvis for the <strong>waist</strong>, unless the figure is bending and those masses pinch together on one side.</p>

<h2>The “T” for the Torso</h2>

<p>When I face the figure head-on or from the back, I usually find it helpful to establish a “T”:</p>

<ol>

<li><strong>Shoulder line</strong> running horizontally.  </li>

<li><strong>Center line</strong> running vertically down the torso.</li>

</ol>

<p>Those lines help orient the major masses. If the pose is more dynamic, I check how the shoulders tilt and how far the center line deviates from vertical. It’s easy to overestimate these angles, so I compare them to a simple mental “grid” and adjust accordingly.</p>

<h2>Front and Back Views</h2>

<p>This approach works whether I’m drawing a front view or back view:</p>

<ul>

<li>

<p><strong>Front View</strong><br />

    I place the rib cage form, then create the slightly bulging <strong>pelvic box</strong> below. The <strong>waist</strong> area is a narrower connection between them.  </p>

</li>

<li>

<p><strong>Back View</strong><br />

    I watch carefully for the <strong>in-and-out</strong> “accordion” effect of the spine. The rib cage often arches back from the neck, then transitions to a flatter section at the waist, and bulges again at the hips if the figure is leaning. I still separate <strong>rib cage</strong> from <strong>pelvis</strong>, and then connect them with simpler lines or bulges that indicate where the spine is pushing outward or curving inward.</p>

</li>

</ul>

<h2>Adjusting Proportions</h2>

<p>I keep my lines light so I can tweak them on the fly:</p>

<ul>

<li>Start with a <strong>waist-wide tube</strong>.  </li>

<li>Decide where the <strong>rib cage ends</strong> and the <strong>hips begin</strong>.  </li>

<li>If needed, shift the center line or expand or narrow the torso before committing to darker lines or refining.</li>

</ul>

<p>By drawing lightly, I can <strong>fix mistakes</strong> simply by drawing on top. I often wait to see proportions in context before finalizing.</p>

<h2>Bending and Twisting</h2>

<p>When the figure leans to one side or twists more dramatically, I track <strong>where the shoulder line and hip line tilt</strong>. I still use the same shapes, but I allow them to:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Pinch</strong> on one side (where rib cage and pelvis come closer).  </li>

<li><strong>Stretch</strong> on the other (where there’s more space).  </li>

</ul>

<p>I rely on quick horizontal and vertical checks, asking myself, “Is that line truly horizontal or vertical?” to keep the alignment in perspective.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p>With these <strong>simplified masses</strong> for the torso, I can quickly capture a wide range of poses. By thinking of the rib cage and pelvis as separate boxes or tubes, and by paying attention to tilts or bends, I get a strong base structure. Then I can add details like <strong>shoulder girdle</strong> or <strong>muscles</strong> as needed. This approach helps me focus on <strong>clear proportions and convincing 3D form</strong> right from the start.</p>
