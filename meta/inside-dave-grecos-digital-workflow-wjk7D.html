<h2>Starting with Thumbnails</h2>

<p>I've been a concept artist for over 23 years, currently working as a senior character concept artist for <strong>World of Warcraft</strong> at Blizzard. When tackling an illustrative piece, like one I did for <strong>Magic the Gathering</strong>, I begin with thumbnails. I usually submit <strong>three to four thumbnails</strong> to the art director, aiming for compositions that read well and fit the required ratio. Once a thumbnail is approved, I enlarge it to the canvas size I want to work on.</p>

<h2>Refining the Sketch</h2>

<p>The initial sketch is often <strong>a total mess</strong>, it's loose and chaotic. To make sense of it, I start working over it with a <strong>cleaner line drawing</strong> and figure out all the moving parts. I'm not too concerned about exact anatomy or final rendering at this stage. It's about getting the <strong>perspective</strong>, the <strong>background elements</strong>, and the <strong>overall layout</strong> in place.</p>

<h2>Building Layers and Blocking In</h2>

<p>I work in <strong>small steps</strong>, layering elements even if I don't know all the colors yet. For complex pieces with many components, like crowds or effects, I use separate layers to block things in. This approach allows me to <strong>adjust elements easily</strong> and ensures I'm not wasting time rendering parts that might change later.</p>

<h2>Collaborating with Art Directors</h2>

<p>Throughout the process, I frequently send stages over to the art director. It's crucial to get feedback on the <strong>layout</strong> and <strong>placement</strong> of elements before diving into detailed rendering. This collaboration helps avoid unnecessary work on areas that may need significant adjustments.</p>

<h2>Working with Reference</h2>

<p>Getting certain elements right, especially <strong>hands</strong>, is vital. I <strong>shoot a ton of hand reference</strong> myself, my phone is filled with photos of my own hands in various poses. If something feels off, I make sure to <strong>find reference</strong> instead of trying to make it up. It's important to spend the time to get these details correct, it shows dedication and improves the overall quality of the piece.</p>

<h2>Balancing the Composition</h2>

<p>I strive to work on the <strong>entire piece simultaneously</strong>, balancing all elements as I go. I pay attention to how the viewer's eye moves around the piece, ensuring there's a good <strong>flow</strong> and that the <strong>shape design</strong> is appealing. I also look for interesting <strong>negative space</strong> and avoid awkward <strong>tangents</strong> between elements.</p>

<h2>Adding Effects Carefully</h2>

<p>When adding effects, like magical energies or environmental elements, I proceed with caution. Effects are placed on their own layers so I can adjust them without affecting the rest of the piece. It's easy to <strong>overdo effects</strong>, so I focus on enhancing the piece without losing focus on the main subjects.</p>

<h2>Final Adjustments</h2>

<p>As I near completion, I make <strong>final tweaks</strong> to enhance the piece. Using tools like <strong>Curves</strong> adjustments in Photoshop, I can punch up the values to make the image pop. I look at the overall value range to ensure there's a good spread between the darkest darks and lightest lights, without overexposing the image.</p>

<h2>The Importance of Iteration</h2>

<p>Throughout the process, if something doesn't feel right, I <strong>keep coming back to it</strong> until it does. I remind myself of artists like John Singer Sargent, who would redo a hand or finger multiple times to get it right. Stopping to fix issues, no matter how small, is a big part of achieving a successful piece.</p>

<h2>Considering Composition for Different Formats</h2>

<p>When creating art for different formats, such as card games versus large prints, I adjust my composition choices. For smaller formats like <strong>Hearthstone</strong> or <strong>Magic the Gathering</strong>, it's important that characters are instantly recognizable, with clear <strong>silhouettes</strong> and dynamic poses. For larger pieces, there's more flexibility to render characters in detailed and nuanced ways.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p>My workflow is about taking <strong>small, manageable steps</strong>, continuously refining, and not being afraid to fix what's not working. By balancing all elements, collaborating with art directors, and paying attention to details like anatomy and composition, I navigate through the challenges of creating concept art from sketch to final illustration.</p>
