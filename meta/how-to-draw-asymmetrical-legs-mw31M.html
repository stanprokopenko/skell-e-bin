<p>I like to use a <strong>simpler on the inside, more complicated on the outside</strong> approach for drawing thighs. This idea comes from the wonderful Berne Hogarth. It helps me show both the <strong>pillar of support</strong> and the <strong>propulsion</strong> in a standing pose. </p>

<h2>Simplifying with Tubes</h2>

<p>I break the thigh down into <strong>asymmetrical tubes</strong>. Whether it’s a male or female leg, I keep these key ideas in mind:<br />

- The inside of the thigh is often <strong>stiffer or straighter</strong>.<br />

- The outside of the thigh is often <strong>longer, fuller, or more fluid</strong>.<br />

- The thigh <strong>tapers</strong> toward the knee.  </p>

<h2>Vertical Moments</h2>

<p>Because the legs are the main pillars of support, I pay close attention to <strong>verticals</strong>. Even if the leg is tilted, I look for:<br />

- Any portions that lean close to vertical, because they suggest stability.<br />

- Slight shifts away from vertical, which show the hip’s angle or the body’s weight distribution.  </p>

<p>I often force near-vertical areas to be precisely vertical in my drawings. That helps me emphasize balance and an upright stance. </p>

<h2>Tapers and S-Curves</h2>

<p>As the thigh transitions into the knee and lower leg, I often use <strong>S-curves</strong> to show how the forms flow. This S-curve approach gives a <strong>lovely, more characteristic</strong> transition. If I’m going for a simpler look, I can keep it more basic. But when I want a <strong>watery, flowing</strong> design, I let that S-curve stand out more.</p>

<h2>Corners vs. Curves</h2>

<p>Sometimes I’ll mark <strong>corners</strong> where the hip meets the thigh or where the thigh meets the knee. Other times I’ll let it flow with a <strong>curve</strong>. I might break the form into more corners if I want a sharper, more muscular look. If I’m drawing a heavier model, there might be less taper, but I still focus on that <strong>inside vs. outside</strong> contrast.</p>

<p>Whether the hip and thigh blend or break apart at a <strong>corner</strong> depends on the model or the desired style. I choose to <strong>iterate</strong> and figure out how strongly I want that shape to read. </p>

<p>By combining these ideas, simpler inside, fuller outside, looking for verticals, using curves and corners, I can make the thigh feel stable, dynamic, and part of a freestanding pose.</p>
