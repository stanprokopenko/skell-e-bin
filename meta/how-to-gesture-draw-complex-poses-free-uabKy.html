<h2>What's in Premium?</h2>

<p>Learn how to adapt your gesture drawing techniques to tackle complex and foreshortened poses. This lesson shows you how to maintain the essence of a pose using lines and rhythms, even when standard proportions don't apply. You'll get practical tips on dealing with foreshortening, adjusting your approach for bent poses, and incorporating observational measurements to capture accurate proportions. The lesson also covers handling seated and crouched poses, avoiding tangents and overlaps, embracing subtlety in less dynamic poses, and staying flexible in your technique to capture any pose effectively.</p>
