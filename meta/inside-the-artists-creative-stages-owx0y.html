<h2>The Importance of <strong>Working in Stages</strong></h2>

<p>Assuming you have bought your materials, we'll begin using them right away. When creating art, it's crucial to understand the value of <strong>working in stages</strong>. I don't know Botticelli's exact approach to his paintings, but I do know that he didn't start in one corner and paint his way across, making it up as he went. He <strong>worked methodically</strong>, in stages.</p>

<h2>My Experience with Advertising Illustration</h2>

<p>In my career, I did <strong>advertising illustration</strong>, which included rendering lots of products. There were no computers to do this back then, so I <strong>airbrushed</strong> them. These projects required <strong>careful planning</strong>, especially under serious time pressure. Let me show you some examples I did for Bruce Mayo, who gave his illustrators wonderful <strong>comps</strong>.</p>

<h3>Planning and Execution</h3>

<p>Bruce gave me this <strong>comp</strong>, and I produced this <strong>finished art</strong>. But I did it in <strong>stages</strong>. First, I would create an <strong>accurate line drawing</strong>, often more than one, until it was approved by the client. Then, I would proceed to <strong>paint</strong> it. I even painted one of these overnight, not Bruce's fault. We'd start with a <strong>rough comp</strong>, then finish the art, drawing it precisely first to get approval before painting.</p>

<p>Sometimes, the products didn't even exist yet, like this water filter. Bruce comped it, I developed it, he critiqued it, and I painted it. This was actually fun when deadlines weren't deadly. So that was my process: <strong>line drawings</strong>, then <strong>paintings</strong>. Very methodical, distinct stages. One can hardly paint this way without the <strong>preliminary stages</strong>.</p>

<h2>Developing a Personal Drawing: <strong>The Mock Turtle</strong></h2>

<p>But it's not just technical illustrations that benefit from being done in stages. Let me show you a personal drawing I did of <strong>the Mock Turtle</strong> from "Alice in Wonderland."</p>

<h3>Thumbnail Sketches and Design</h3>

<p>I started with lots of <strong>thumbnail-sized drawings</strong> to find a decent design. Whether I actually found one or not is up for debate, but I decided on a design with the help of my studio friend, who told me how much it <strong>sucked</strong>. So I kept trying until he said something like, "Maybe." With that encouragement, I started to develop it.</p>

<h3>Refining the Details</h3>

<p>But there was something I didn't like about the position of his <strong>head</strong>. The angle felt wrong. I don't know why, but it seemed like his head needed to <strong>tip up more</strong>. So I did some <strong>analysis</strong>. The head was in this <strong>position</strong>, purely like that. So I redrew the head in this <strong>position</strong>, and went at it all over again. I liked it enough to <strong>finish</strong>, and I almost won over my studio friend. He complimented it the way you compliment a two-year-old when they've drawn a complete circle, even if it isn't round.</p>

<p>This was about changing the position of his head, and the change was all about that <strong>center line</strong>. Let me show you.</p>

<h2>Understanding Forms Through Perspective</h2>

<p>A <strong>ball with lines around it</strong>, three rubber bands, is probably the most useful form to master if you want to draw anything in the world. But to do that, it sure helps to know how to <strong>bend those rubber bands</strong>. I'll teach you everything you need to know about that.</p>

<h3>The Ball and Rubber Bands</h3>

<p>One thing you'll learn is that a rubber band around a ball relates to a rubber band around a box, like that, and like that, like that, and like that. These lines don't usually make it into the finished piece. It's <strong>work behind the scenes</strong>, and it comes from the <strong>perspective skill</strong> of knowing how to put a line on a ball.</p>

<p>Of course, you can build a mock turtle in 3D and not have to go through all this, but even that has its own challenges. If you want to draw, I'm showing you <strong>secret behind-the-scenes knowledge</strong> for artists.</p>

<h2>Working Behind the Scenes</h2>

<p>It often takes several stages to create an image. But not all stages need to be careful. In fact, perhaps the most important stage near the beginning is <strong>not to be careful</strong> but to throw out all sorts of <strong>options</strong> and let them be <strong>un-careful</strong>. The idea is to let <strong>spontaneity</strong> take over. Go with the flow, but don't go too slow. Pour out ideas, put <strong>time limits</strong> on it so you don't overthink things in the hope that some will come out <strong>alive</strong>. Then choose and refine.</p>

<h2>Using Vellum to Refine Your Work</h2>

<p>Even if you draw a live one and kill it, you may <strong>resurrect it</strong> by starting all over with <strong>vellum</strong>. Trace over, make another mess, do it again. <strong>Vellum</strong> makes working in stages easier. You can do this so easily with the computer now, but I like the fact that it's <strong>real cotton</strong>, tangible, made for the human touch paper. And if you like to draw on paper by hand the old way, surround yourself with it.</p>

<h2>Balancing Careful Planning and Spontaneity</h2>

<p>This separated process is one way of working, very valuable. Most artists do this, especially professionals. But I found that doing professional work for years got me so used to working in separate stages, I couldn't just sit down and draw a picture <strong>spontaneously</strong>. <strong>Spontaneous drawing</strong>, like a live improv, can sharpen your instincts and be one of the most valuable ways to draw, but many people find it difficult.</p>

<h2>Looking Ahead</h2>

<p>If you do find it difficult, in our next lesson, I'll show you how buying <strong>sketchbooks</strong> and filling them with lots of drawings can help, and how that happened with me. I'll share some lessons about <strong>taking risks</strong>.</p>
