<h2>Turning Foreshortening into an Opportunity</h2>

<p>Foreshortening can be intimidating, but it's one of the most <strong>beautiful opportunities</strong> in drawing. Instead of measuring every detail, I prefer to <strong>measure with rhythm</strong>, allowing the drawing to flow naturally. When facing a foreshortened pose, especially one exaggerated by a camera's lens, we can <strong>embrace the distortion</strong> and use it to enhance our work.</p>

<h2>Using the Mermaid's Net</h2>

<p>To tackle complex poses, I use the <strong>mermaid's net</strong>, also known as the <strong>envelope</strong>. This technique helps me establish the <strong>parameters</strong> of where all the limbs fit within the composition. I start by feeling out where the elbows, knees, and other points extend, creating a rough shape that contains the figure.</p>

<h2>Adjusting Proportions in Foreshortening</h2>

<p>In foreshortening, certain adjustments are necessary. For example, if you draw a small head, it often looks wrong. So, I make the head <strong>larger</strong> to compensate for the distortion. Similarly, I <strong>exaggerate the hips and knees</strong>, emphasizing the shapes that are closer to the viewer. Remember, camera lenses can distort reality, but as artists, we can choose how to represent these elements.</p>

<h2>Drawing with Rhythm and Anatomy</h2>

<p>I focus on capturing the <strong>rhythm</strong> of the body rather than getting caught up in precise measurements. Understanding anatomy is crucial. I pay attention to muscles like the <strong>tensor fasciae latae</strong> (think of it as a pocket you can put your hand into) and how gravity affects the <strong>compression</strong> of muscles and flesh. Recognizing these nuances adds depth and realism to the drawing.</p>

<h2>Pushing the Drawing to Its Limits</h2>

<p>I believe in the mantra <strong>"push it till it breaks."</strong> This means pushing your drawing to the edge of exaggeration and then pulling back if needed. It's about exploring the possibilities and not being afraid to make mistakes. <strong>There are no mistakes</strong>, only learning experiences. By challenging ourselves, we tap into our <strong>internal art engine</strong>, built from all our practice and mileage.</p>

<h2>Balancing Technique and Expression</h2>

<p>Art isn't just about the technical <strong>nuts and bolts</strong>, it is about <strong>expressing yourself</strong>. I encourage you to <strong>kill the ego</strong> and be fearless in your approach. Whether you're adding fantasy elements, like turning hair into flowing mermaid locks, or adjusting shadows to enhance form, make choices that please you. **Please yourself, and your audience will find you. **</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p>Foreshortening offers a chance to infuse your work with <strong>rhythm and dynamism</strong>. By embracing the challenge, understanding anatomy, and allowing yourself to experiment, you can create compelling and expressive drawings. I invite you to take these principles and <strong>finish the drawing yourself</strong>. Remember, this is about expressing yourself as an artist.</p>
