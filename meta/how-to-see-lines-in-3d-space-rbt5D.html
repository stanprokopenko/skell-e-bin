<p><strong>Now to these exciting forms.</strong> They are the <strong>"My Dog Has Fleas"</strong> for artists to play their hearts out later. They are <strong>foundations</strong> that will serve you for much more.</p>

<h2>Understanding Lines Like Scientists</h2>

<p>The purpose here is to understand <strong>straight lines not like artists but like scientists</strong>. <strong>Labeling every position in space</strong> helps you to truly understand space.</p>

<h3>The Three Sets of Lines</h3>

<p>The first ones are the easy ones. You shouldn't have trouble with these. Every line is one of <strong>three sets</strong>, and you can name them anything as long as you don't confuse their names.</p>

<p>But here's where it takes a little concentration.</p>

<h2>Perception of Width and Depth</h2>

<p>The person at the end of a table will say <strong>this is the width</strong>, and the table is <strong>deep</strong>. The person at the side of the table will say <strong>this is the width</strong>, and the table is <strong>shallow</strong>. Whatever the case, <strong>sketch it</strong>, <strong>identify the lines</strong>, <strong>spin it</strong>, <strong>sketch it again</strong>, <strong>relabel the lines</strong>, and here's the big deal: as you sketch, <strong>name the lines out loud</strong>. That digs it in.</p>

<h2>Understanding Diagonal Lines and Bevels</h2>

<p>Now for the <strong>bevels</strong>, the <strong>diagonal lines</strong>. Any line lying level but not a pure <strong>X</strong> or <strong>Z</strong> has got to be both. Any line <strong>aiming up</strong> even slightly has got to have <strong>Y</strong> in its name. If it leans <strong>front or back</strong>, <strong>YZ</strong> makes sense. If it leans <strong>side to side</strong>, <strong>XY</strong> makes sense.</p>

<h3>Three-Way Diagonals</h3>

<p>Now for the <strong>three-way diagonals</strong>. You could cheat on this one, just label every line <strong>X</strong>, <strong>Y</strong>, and <strong>Z</strong>, and you'll pass the test, but you'd <strong>miss the point of the line</strong>. Imagine this straight line, a mere angle on your flat paper, as part of this awesome illusion. What is a line but a <strong>dot that, when it moves, makes a trail</strong>? Straight lines are the simplest trail.</p>

<p>Some lines move on only one axis, <strong>X</strong>, <strong>Y</strong>, or <strong>Z</strong>. Some move on two, for example, any floor plan, wall plan, or ceiling likely has lines that move on only two axes. But some lines <strong>move on all three</strong>, which are the most complex non-curving lines. Draw, name, and <strong>imagine writing these lines</strong> left-right, up-down, front-back, and combinations.</p>

<p>If you take time to observe and <strong>label their three variations</strong>, you build your skill to <strong>imagine lines as more than just graphic elements but as directions in space</strong>.</p>

<h2>Approaching Lines in Space</h2>

<h3>See Simple First</h3>

<p>Here is a hint for how to approach it. <strong>See simple first</strong>, just like with shapes where we want to see simply. <strong>Studying forms</strong>, we keep it simple by keeping <strong>right angles</strong> in mind. In fact, <strong>draw them out</strong>. The more you can compare diagonals to right angles, the more you understand where the diagonal is leaning from.</p>

<h3>Starting with a Base or Wall</h3>

<p>Here's another hint, more advanced. If we start with a <strong>base and build up</strong>, the base helps us solve every <strong>width and depth point</strong>. Each point is sure to be on a <strong>height line above it</strong>, so travel on <strong>Y</strong>, and you may overshoot it or you may undershoot it, but you won't go off track.</p>

<p>What you learn is there is a <strong>logic to lines</strong>, and establishing a floor creates a foundation for all <strong>X</strong> and <strong>Z</strong> angles.</p>

<p>Sometimes it's best to start not with the floor, but the <strong>wall</strong>. A wall helps us solve every <strong>height</strong> and, say, <strong>depth point</strong>. <strong>Width lines</strong> in this case are easy, they just go across. <strong>Take a ride on width</strong>, and we may pass our point, but we're at least on the right track.</p>

<p>The <strong>floor</strong> or the other <strong>wall</strong> gives us a marker on depth to find the point we seek. On the width, it's just bound to that.</p>

<p>Sometimes it's best to define a <strong>floor, wall, or ceiling</strong>, and then put things on them or in them.</p>

<h2>Building Complexity from Simplicity</h2>

<p>We're doing this simply to start, in case you're a beginner. This <strong>spider</strong> was not simple, but I did it the same way. I made myself sure of the <strong>width and depth</strong>, we call that a <strong>plan</strong>. The <strong>height and depth</strong> came from a wall, we call that a <strong>side elevation</strong>. The <strong>height and width</strong> also came from a wall, another elevation, and lots of time connecting lines.</p>

<p>That's pretty much it for those of you who want more complexity. This is the <strong>secret</strong>: <strong>complex form comes from combining three simple axes</strong>. But we're getting ahead.</p>

<h2>The Importance of This Groundwork</h2>

<p>You may wonder, why all this fuss? "I just want to <strong>draw free and loose</strong>." You will. This <strong>prepares your awareness</strong> so that even in your <strong>loose sketching</strong>, you will see <strong>hidden planes</strong>. This is <strong>groundwork</strong>. It is supposed to be <strong>simple but thoughtful</strong>. Start here as you like.</p>

<h2>Starting Your Drawings</h2>

<p>Two more reminders:</p>

<ol>

<li>

<p>You don't have to begin with straight lines. You can start with <strong>blobs before getting to the straight lines</strong>.</p>

</li>

<li>

<p>Best to start <strong>lightly</strong>. <strong>Light lines</strong> will fade back as you find and correct them.</p>

</li>

</ol>

<p>However you do it, once you've got straight lines, <strong>name out the lines for the directions they move</strong>.</p>

<h2>What's Next</h2>

<p>In our next lesson, we'll see how <strong>grids for environments and objects</strong> keep us on track for line directions. Coming soon, we have a <strong>demo</strong> where I'll <strong>draw the airplane one more time</strong>, and we will work on <strong>guessing proportions on these axes</strong>. See you then.</p>
