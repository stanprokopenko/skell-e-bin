<h2>Setting Up Reference Material</h2>

<p>After opening my thumbnail sketch, I begin the process of bringing in photo reference to tighten up and bring my drawing to a more finished state. I hired a model, Yoni, whom I've worked with on several illustrations. I posed and lit him like <strong>The Thing</strong>, and also gathered stock photos of rocks to combine with my current design.</p>

<h2>Adjusting the Canvas and Starting the Drawing</h2>

<p>I start by adjusting the canvas size, widening it to use as a clipboard for my reference images. With my reference in place, I begin refining the silhouette of <strong>Ben Grimm</strong>. I might adjust the pose slightly, as I like some of the dynamics in the reference photos. Using the anatomy of the model and blending it with rock formations, I aim to create a believable version of The Thing.</p>

<h2>Focusing on the Silhouette and Big Shapes</h2>

<p>Using my modified round brush, I start painting areas out, focusing on the silhouette and carving into it. I treat this process much like I would with a real painting, starting very general and getting the two-value block-in. I don't worry about the rock formations yet, instead, I concentrate on capturing the overall figure first.</p>

<h2>Enhancing Authenticity with Reference</h2>

<p>One of the big things I look for when working with reference is <strong>authenticity</strong>, that believability that comes from combining what I see, what I know, and what I'd like to see. My teacher, Jeff Watts, often says,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Drawing is part what you see, part what you know, and part what you'd like to see."</p>

</blockquote>

<p>I use this philosophy to enhance my illustrations, striving to make the unbelievable believable.</p>

<h2>Incorporating Anatomy and Rock Formations</h2>

<p>I continue refining the big shapes, borrowing from the reference and enhancing my initial sketch. I'm mindful of the anatomy, even though The Thing is a rock man. I work on rolling the forms, adjusting edges, and ensuring the figure feels natural. Even with his rocky facade, I aim to preserve the human elements in his form.</p>

<h2>Adding Texture and Details</h2>

<p>Once I'm satisfied with the overall figure, I start sculpting the rocks. I use the anatomy as a guide, creating crags and facets that wrap around the muscles and bones. I add lighter values to create bevels, indicating where the light hits the edges of the rocks. By randomizing textures and colors, I introduce <strong>realism and variation</strong> into the rock formations.</p>

<h2>Finalizing the Drawing</h2>

<p>As I work, I keep in mind the importance of not making everything too uniform. Slight value and color fluctuations add authenticity to the piece. I adjust opacities and brush sizes to create broken color effects, much like traditional painters do.</p>

<p>Throughout this process, I periodically step back to compare the refined drawing with the original thumbnail. The silhouette remains largely the same, but now it has more character and energy. The drawing feels more authentic and believable, it feels like a man made of rock holding up a spaceship.</p>

<h2>Moving Forward to the Final Painting</h2>

<p>With the drawing finalized, I now have a solid guide for my oil painting. While I may still make changes during the painting process, this detailed drawing ensures I have a strong foundation to work from. It's all about baby steps, starting with <strong>design and composition</strong>, refining the drawing with reference, and ultimately bringing the piece to life with paint.</p>
