<h2>Losing Our Jobs and Finding Puppetry</h2>

<p>In 2020, my wife and I both lost our jobs. It was a tough time, but it also opened up an unexpected opportunity. My wife wanted to try making puppets, something she'd always been interested in. So, we decided to give it a shot.</p>

<p>We started making puppets and put them up for adoption online. We made some videos, just playing around and having fun, and we posted them. To our surprise, some of them went viral. That allowed us to keep growing, and we thought, "You know what? Let's give it a shot. Let's try it out." Now, it's our full-time 9-to-5 job.</p>

<h2>Following What You Care About Most</h2>

<p>People always want to find the thing that's going to make the most money or be the most stable career because, obviously, you need to pay the bills. But our advice is different, **don't do the most logical thing, do the thing you care about most. **</p>

<p>Do something you actually really like to do, as opposed to doing something because you think, "Oh, this will get me money." Sure, making money is important, but that approach gets tiring after a while. It's more sustainable to pursue something you genuinely enjoy.</p>

<h2>Balancing Art and Business</h2>

<p>Turning art into a business is hard, it's difficult. We still have to figure out how to make money from what we love, without losing the joy it brings us. It's about finding that balance.</p>

<p>When we hear from someone, like a kid who's now excited about puppetry because of us, it feeds us in a different way. It makes us want to keep going, because we're having an effect on somebody. **That's the more rewarding side. **</p>

<h2>Misconceptions About Success</h2>

<p>Likes and followers on Instagram don't necessarily correlate to business success. People sometimes see big numbers and think it's a big business, but it's just the two of us. We're the only ones answering emails, we're the only ones doing everything. Don't think that once you reach a certain level of followers or money everything becomes easy. It actually keeps getting harder.</p>

<h2>Just Go for It</h2>

<p>We always tell people to just do it, just go for it. You might find that what you thought you wanted isn't exactly right, and you need to adjust. You learn from whatever it is, and that's really the point. **You can never fully plan it out. ** You'll veer off and go different ways, but you'll end up finishing whatever it is.</p>

<h2>The Rewarding and Stressful Journey</h2>

<p>From our experience, this journey is <strong>the most rewarding, the most stressful.</strong> It will ask everything from you, take a lot from you, and give you a lot. That's why it goes back to really liking what you do.</p>

<p>If people stopped following you, or if you didn't have followers, would you still enjoy doing it? If the answer is yes, then just do it. Who knows, it could take off, or it might just be a fun thing you do on weekends with friends. It's similar to playing D&amp;D, or something like that. Have fun with it.</p>

<h2>Enjoying the Moments</h2>

<p>As performers, we love doing this. There are times when we'll have a convention coming up, and we have so much to do. But once we're there, setting up, doing the shows, interacting with people, it reminds us why we do this. Making people laugh and smile is what makes it all worthwhile.</p>

<p><strong>Try to take the time to realize whatever you're doing is fun and what you love.</strong> You won't always succeed at this, but try.</p>

<h2>Embracing Mistakes and Embarrassment</h2>

<p>You're probably going to embarrass yourself at some point. That's part of the process. I mean, I puppeteer, so that's my job, to embrace embarrassment.</p>

<p>We didn't go to school for puppet-making or any of this stuff. We both had different jobs before. I have an acting background, and my wife has been an artist and photographer. We decided to try something else and make it work. As it started to build, we thought, "I think we can do this, so let's jump in and see what happens." It's been worth all the highs and lows.</p>

<h2>The Ongoing Work Behind the Scenes</h2>

<p>Even when you've had something successful, there's still work to do, the post-work of taking the show down, driving everything home, and checking out of hotels. We only do local shows because it's a big build, and just the two of us.</p>

<p>The stage itself is over <strong>800 coffee stirrers glued down</strong>. It takes several hours to put together. You'll have to take a look when we set it up. It's a big show. I love the outcome, and I'm so proud of it.</p>

<p>We'd love to travel and do more. It's a dream goal to have a little more going around, and hopefully, we'll get there one day. But even if we don't, it's still fun to do any of these.</p>

<h2>Looking Forward: What's Next</h2>

<p>We're starting to get into a little mini production studio, making puppets for commercials or projects that want to put puppets in them. That's kind of where we feel we're going. We're having fun doing different projects, working on other things, evolving, and seeing where it goes.</p>

<p>I feel like media is starting to get back to that physical and tangible type of thing. I want to be a part of that, **building back to something physical that's in your hands, that you see on screen, that's real and there. **</p>

<h2>The Value of Physical Media</h2>

<p>With AI becoming a big thing, especially affecting industries like animation, I think physical media and making things that are tangible will have a premium at some point. When you go back and watch a movie with physically made props, you can see it, you can feel it, you know it. It's going to be like a renaissance or resurgence of real things, and I want to be a part of that.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p>It sounds simple, but <strong>just do it</strong>. Nike said it. Shia LaBeouf said it. All of them said it. Just do it. You are the only thing that can stop you, nobody else can. Whatever you're happy with, whatever you're passionate about, whatever it is, just do it and have fun.</p>
