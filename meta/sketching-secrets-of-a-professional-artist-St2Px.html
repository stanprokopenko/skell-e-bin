<h2>Embracing the Sketchbook</h2>

<p>I fill about a <strong>sketchbook a year</strong>, drawing without specific plans or themes. I try to <strong>carry a sketchbook everywhere</strong>, sketching whenever inspiration strikes. My sketchbooks contain a bit of everything, from studies to spontaneous sketches.</p>

<h2>Developing Drawing Habits</h2>

<p>I aim to <strong>draw daily</strong>, often at the same time to make it habitual, usually in the morning or before projects. Warming up might involve <strong>freehand drawing</strong> or <strong>testing new materials</strong>. Even one sketch satisfies my daily art practice.</p>

<h2>Using References and Video</h2>

<p>I use many references, including <strong>photos and videos</strong>. Lately, <strong>video references</strong> help me capture <strong>motion and gesture</strong>, offering a sense of drawing from life when live models aren't available. Pausing videos allows me to explore various poses and movements.</p>

<h2>Exploring Materials and Surfaces</h2>

<p>Before professional work, I <strong>test materials</strong> in my sketchbook, as different papers react differently. Some surfaces are great for smudges but not for markers. <strong>Testing</strong> helps me understand trade-offs and choose the right tools.</p>

<h2>Shape Exploration and Minimalism</h2>

<p>I enjoy <strong>exploring shapes</strong>, seeing how much I can convey with <strong>minimal lines</strong>. <strong>Simplifying shapes</strong> and grouping them creates visual interest without losing realism, a <strong>dance between realism and design</strong>. I test how far I can simplify before losing clarity.</p>

<h2>Sketching for Ideas, Not Perfection</h2>

<p>In my sketchbook, I <strong>test ideas</strong> rather than strive for perfect drawings. If a drawing isn't working, I <strong>move on</strong>. I don't draw on the back of pages to preserve each piece and prevent imprinting. Treating each drawing individually lets me <strong>experiment without pressure</strong>.</p>

<h2>Managing Multiple Sketchbooks</h2>

<p>I keep <strong>multiple sketchbooks</strong>, sometimes three at once, each with different surfaces suited for various materials. <strong>Canson paper</strong> has a nice tooth for pencils, while <strong>Moleskine sketchbooks</strong> are thicker and better for markers.</p>

<h2>Keeping Drawing Efficient</h2>

<p>I avoid getting stuck on <strong>setup or materials</strong>. If setup hinders creating, I switch to <strong>quick and easy tools</strong>. I've <strong>trimmed my tools</strong> to essentials, I can carry them anywhere. <strong>Drawing daily</strong> maintains practice, even with limited time. <strong>Creating matters more than perfect setups</strong>.</p>

<h2>Composing Overlapping Images</h2>

<p>When composing overlapping images, I start with one element and build upon it, ensuring important parts aren't lost. It's like <strong>collaging as I go</strong>. Not overthinking beforehand prevents creative blocks, allowing ideas to springboard.</p>

<h2>Deciding What to Render or Imply</h2>

<p>I decide what to render or imply based on <strong>the reference</strong> and <strong>what catches my eye</strong>, often a pose, face, or silhouette. I start there and build around it, <strong>rendering</strong> some elements fully, while <strong>implying</strong> or skipping others.</p>

<h2>Finding Inspiration Everywhere</h2>

<p>If I'm unsure what to draw, I find inspiration in <strong>videos</strong>, <strong>billboards</strong>, or <strong>ads</strong>, anything can be a reference. I'll sketch from videos of performances or people walking, pausing randomly. You would be surprised how much information you can get from <strong>random sources</strong>. Drawing solves problems on paper, especially for larger pieces or commissions.</p>
