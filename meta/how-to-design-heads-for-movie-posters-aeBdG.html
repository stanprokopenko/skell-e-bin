<p>Hi, my name is Chris Legaspi. I'm a professional movie poster artist, author, and instructor. Today, I'm going to talk about how to design heads for movie posters.</p>

<p>I've been working in the industry for several years. Some of my notable projects include <strong>Deadpool</strong>, <strong>Shaft</strong>, and <strong>Birds of Prey</strong>. You might be wondering, does this still exist? Well, I was thinking the exact same thing, and yes, it does. In fact, one of the greatest movie poster artists ever, <strong>Drew Struzan</strong>, is still alive and working today, still doing hand-drawn, hand-illustrated movie posters.</p>

<p>What's more in demand, besides the actual finished poster, is all the <strong>concept and design work</strong> that goes into every finished poster. That's what we're going to focus on today.</p>

<h2>Why Design Is Important</h2>

<p>You might be wondering, "Why design? Why is design important? I just want to draw Tom Cruise, why is design important?" Well, in this business, every movie poster has to really <strong>grab your attention</strong>, and design is the main tool to do that.</p>

<p>As artists, we're required to be not only very good at drawing faces and characters, but we also have to be very fast. It's a high-demand business, and <strong>design</strong> is the main tool to help me be fast, accurate, and get that killer likeness. Our main responsibilities as artists are to <strong>get the likeness</strong> and <strong>communicate the story and the feeling</strong> of our movie.</p>

<p>Design is simply the ability to <strong>organize shapes</strong>. When we're designing heads and faces for movie posters, there are really three main shapes that I look at:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Primary shape</strong></li>

<li><strong>Secondary shapes</strong></li>

<li><strong>Detail shapes</strong></li>

</ul>

<h2>Understanding Shapes in Head Design</h2>

<h3>Major Shapes</h3>

<p>The <strong>major shapes</strong> are things like the <strong>outline</strong>, the <strong>silhouette</strong>, and the <strong>contour</strong>. That's really important. Things like the <strong>head type</strong>, we want to make sure we get that to look and feel like our character or actor.</p>

<h3>Secondary Shapes</h3>

<p><strong>Secondary shapes</strong> are things like <strong>planar shapes</strong>, the shape of the <strong>eye socket</strong>, and maybe a little bit of the underside of the <strong>nose</strong>. The nose itself could be a big secondary shape, and also the shape of the <strong>hair</strong> relative to the shape of the face, and things like <strong>costume pieces</strong>. Those are the big secondary shapes.</p>

<h3>Detail Shapes</h3>

<p>Finally, the <strong>detail shapes</strong> are the smaller shapes, specifically shapes of <strong>value</strong> that I look for, light and dark, specifically things that tend to be very dark naturally. For example, the <strong>eyebrow</strong>, the <strong>pupil</strong>, the <strong>shadow under your nose</strong>, and the <strong>underside of your lips</strong>. All of these together can help us create the full picture of the portrait that we're trying to draw.</p>

<h2>Demonstration: Putting the Shapes Together</h2>

<p>Now I'm going to demonstrate these ideas and show you how to put all these shapes together.</p>

<p>When you're choosing references for this exercise or you're choosing actors, start with faces that have very obvious <strong>head types</strong>. You want ones that have clear, sharp rectangular shapes, or clearly round shapes. Make it easier for yourself at the beginning, and then you can get into other faces and actors and characters that have more subtle features. But in the beginning, when you're first learning and training your eye, start with head types and head shapes that are very obvious and very clear.</p>

<h3>Beginning with the Major Shape</h3>

<p>We're going to begin with the <strong>major shape</strong>, so that is the outer shape, also known as the <strong>silhouette</strong> or the <strong>contour</strong>. This will help me not only define the character or the actor, but also the <strong>2D space</strong>. Once I have the major silhouette, then I go for the <strong>head type</strong>. This is what you're seeing here. The head type is basically, in this case, a front view, so that's the general shape of his face, and his head type is quite <strong>rectangular</strong> and <strong>long</strong>.</p>

<h3>Adding the Secondary Shapes</h3>

<p>Now that I have the major shapes, I'm going to go for the <strong>secondary shapes</strong>. To me, that's some of the more major <strong>planes</strong>, like defining the <strong>side plane</strong>, the <strong>cheek</strong> there, and the planes of the <strong>eye socket</strong>. That's a really important plane for likeness and just overall structure of head drawing. Obviously, things like the <strong>nose</strong> and also the <strong>mouth</strong>. So, I've got to be mindful of the shape of the mouth, the thickness, and its planes as well.</p>

<h3>Defining the Detail Shapes</h3>

<p>The last set of shapes that I need to define are the <strong>detail shapes</strong>. To get the detail shapes, I look for the <strong>light and dark shapes</strong>, the <strong>high-contrast shapes</strong>. These are typically the <strong>eyebrow</strong>, the <strong>pupil</strong>, the <strong>shadow under your eyelid</strong> creates a dark shadow but also a unique shape that helps with the likeness, and then of course the <strong>nostrils</strong> and the small shadow shapes where the nostrils meet the face. Obviously, I can refine the shape of the <strong>lips</strong>, in this case specifically the <strong>top lip</strong> because that's also a plane, and then also some of the smaller dark shapes at the side of the lips and the <strong>underplane of the lower lip</strong>. So basically, they're features and parts of the features that create light and dark shapes as well.</p>

<h3>Bringing Up the Drawing</h3>

<p>I've got all of my important shapes defined. Now, I'm just going to continue to <strong>bring up the drawing</strong>. I'm going to start by <strong>filling in my shapes with tone</strong>. Really, I'm starting to begin the <strong>finishing process</strong>. This starts with adding <strong>light and dark shapes</strong>, filling in the dark shapes in this case, and adding the gradual things like the <strong>halftones</strong>, the <strong>transition tones</strong>. This starts to show <strong>form</strong> as well. But the most important thing, I want to start is clearly defining <strong>what's light and what's dark</strong>, a very simple light and dark value pattern at first.</p>

<p>Obviously, I also want to make sure that the detail shapes, which were the dark shapes that I called out, are clearly defined in this case.</p>

<p>Here I'm using a <strong>Prismacolor black pencil</strong>. So this is a softer pencil, so it gets a little bit darker. Most of my tones are blocked in and they're reading well. I feel pretty good about the <strong>likeness</strong>. Now I'm just going to continue to refine the <strong>lighting</strong> and the <strong>shading</strong>, really take this drawing to a nice <strong>finish</strong> and make it a sketch that could be used for a <strong>poster comp</strong>.</p>

<h2>Homework Exercises</h2>

<p>Now it's your turn. To help you improve these skills, here's some homework exercises I recommend.</p>

<h3>Warm-Ups: Sketch Head Types and Head Shapes</h3>

<p>Before you do every exercise, do some <strong>warm-ups</strong>. Just sketch some <strong>head types</strong> and <strong>head shapes</strong>, and you can exaggerate and play with them, just to get yourself warmed up.</p>

<h3>Study the Contour: The Silhouette</h3>

<p>Learn to train your eye to see the <strong>outer shape</strong>, the <strong>silhouette</strong>. Remember, that's the most important foundation of our drawing. So, <strong>study the contour</strong>. You don't have to draw any detail. You don't have to do any finished drawing. I recommend doing them fairly small so you can do a lot. You can jump on a Pinterest page or a folder of your own reference that has a bunch of faces, a bunch of actors or characters, and just start to practice and get a good head type first, and exaggerate and get the nuance and character of each one.</p>

<h3>'Poster Vision' Exercise</h3>

<p>The third exercise is what I call <strong>poster vision</strong>. This is where you start to get into the <strong>detail shapes</strong>. Once you become familiar with doing the outer shape, the outline, and the silhouette, and getting a good head type, now you want to come in and start doing the detail shapes. These will be the <strong>light and dark shapes</strong>, mostly things like the <strong>brow</strong>, the <strong>eyebrow</strong>, the little shadow under the <strong>nose</strong>. You can start to get a little bit more specific. Again, don't worry too much about the detail. Just learn to train your eye first. Make them very simple, only <strong>black and white</strong>. No need to do full-finished drawing or any shading.</p>

<h3>Share Your Work</h3>

<p>Don't forget to <strong>share your work</strong>. Use the <strong>#Proko</strong> or <strong>#headdesign</strong> hashtags. We'll be able to see your work online.</p>
