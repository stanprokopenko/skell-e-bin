<p>I visited <strong>Fullerton Community College</strong>, where I teach part-time, to catch up with my former student from decades ago, <strong>Phil Dimitriadis</strong>. Phil is now a <strong>concept artist</strong> for the entertainment industry, and we sat down to talk about his work and career.</p>

<h2>Phil's Role as a Concept Artist</h2>

<p>Phil works as a concept artist, solving problems for <strong>animated features</strong>, <strong>videos</strong>, <strong>TV shows</strong>, and various clients. When he's brought onto a project, he's often handed a <strong>script</strong> and tasked with identifying <strong>locations</strong> and <strong>challenges</strong>. He then designs and draws these elements, figuring out how the <strong>animation</strong> will look and what the <strong>environments</strong> will be.</p>

<h3>Quick Marker Comps and Photoshop Adjustments</h3>

<p>Phil showed me some <strong>quick marker comps</strong> he did. He can work extremely fast with <strong>markers</strong>, often preferring to <strong>thumbnail traditionally</strong> and then scan it into <strong>Photoshop</strong> for adjustments. These sketches take about <strong>two hours</strong> each, depending on the complexity.</p>

<h3>Working from Imagination</h3>

<p>Phil creates these designs entirely from his <strong>imagination</strong>. As a concept artist, he comes up with ideas and draws them so others can build or film them. He emphasizes the importance of <strong>critical thinking</strong> and <strong>problem-solving</strong>, especially when something in the script doesn't make sense. It's his job to figure out the <strong>director's vision</strong> and bring all that information together to provide a solution.</p>

<h2>Blending Traditional and Digital Techniques</h2>

<p>Phil often works with <strong>pen and ink</strong> enhanced with <strong>markers</strong>, adjusted in <strong>Photoshop</strong>. Some of his pieces are more complex due to subject matter and can take <strong>three to four hours</strong>. He showed me some entirely <strong>freehand drawings</strong> done with <strong>color erase blue pencils</strong> on cheap Xerox paper for projects like <strong>"Batman: The Brave and the Bold"</strong> at <strong>Warner Brothers</strong>.</p>

<h3>Using Maya for Complex Environments</h3>

<p>For more complex scenes, Phil starts with <strong>traditional thumbnails</strong> and sketches, then builds the location in <strong>Maya</strong> to solve <strong>camera</strong> and <strong>setup issues</strong>. This approach helps him figure out <strong>depth ratios</strong> and <strong>camera angles</strong>, especially for large locations or intricate environments.</p>

<h2>The Importance of Perspective Training</h2>

<p>I asked Phil about the role of <strong>perspective</strong> in his work, especially with the advent of 3D modeling tools like Maya. He believes that foundational skills in <strong>perspective training</strong> are crucial. While tools like <strong>Maya</strong> and <strong>Photoshop</strong> can speed up the process, they are just that, <strong>tools</strong>. Knowing how to <strong>draw and compose scenes by hand</strong> allows for greater adaptability, and creativity.</p>

<h3>Avoiding Reliance on Digital Shortcuts</h3>

<p>Phil discussed the risks of relying too heavily on digital tools like <strong>perspective grid brushes</strong> in Photoshop or <strong>automatic perspective tools</strong> in Sketchbook Pro. He feels that these can become <strong>crutches</strong>, limiting an artist's ability to think about scenes from a <strong>storytelling</strong> and <strong>staging</strong> point of view.</p>

<h3>Perspective as Key to Quick Ideation</h3>

<p>Phil emphasized that <strong>perspective training</strong> and "thumping it into my head" was key to being able to <strong>design and draw ideas quickly</strong>. He uses 3D tools to speed up production but doesn't let them replace the core foundational skills of <strong>draftsmanship</strong>, <strong>composition</strong>, and <strong>staging</strong>.</p>

<h2>Phil's Design Process</h2>

<p>Phil shared his multi-stage <strong>design process</strong>:</p>

<ol>

<li><strong>Traditional Thumbnails</strong>: Starting with quick sketches to map out ideas.</li>

<li><strong>Silhouette Shapes</strong>: Developing shapes and visual forms in 3D space.</li>

<li><strong>Detailed Sketches</strong>: Refining the composition and adding details.</li>

<li><strong>3D Modeling</strong>: Building the scene in <strong>Maya</strong> to solve camera angles and depth.</li>

<li><strong>Paint Overs</strong>: Doing quick renders and painting over them to establish mood and color.</li>

</ol>

<p>He showcased an example where he was inspired by a neighbor's garage and went through these stages to create a richly detailed environment.</p>

<h2>Advice for Aspiring Artists</h2>

<p>Phil believes that <strong>constant drawing practice</strong> is essential. Tools like Maya and Photoshop can be learned relatively quickly, but <strong>foundational drawing skills</strong> take years to develop. He stresses the importance of being in your <strong>sketchbook</strong>, <strong>pushing your level to a higher plateau</strong>, and continuing to <strong>take classes</strong> even when working professionally.</p>

<h3>The Value of Artistic Community</h3>

<p>We discussed how important it is to be around other <strong>artists</strong> who are also learning and growing. Phil shared how he spent time with other artists at Fullerton College, like <strong>Justin Sweet</strong> and <strong>Vance Kovacs</strong>, talking about <strong>design</strong> and <strong>anatomy</strong>. Being part of an <strong>artistic community</strong> helps everyone improve.</p>

<h2>Our History Together</h2>

<p>Phil took my <strong>perspective class</strong> at Fullerton College back in the early '90s. He was committed to developing his skills and set out to draw for a living. Over time, he leveled up his skills and became known for being a <strong>problem solver</strong> in the industry. It's been a pleasure to see him grow from a beginning art student to a professional colleague and fellow teacher.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p>Phil continues to teach at <strong>Fullerton College</strong> and shares his knowledge through platforms like <strong>ArtStation</strong> and his <strong>YouTube channel</strong>, <strong>Phil's Design Corner</strong>. His dedication to foundational skills and his willingness to adapt tools to enhance his work make him a valuable resource for students and aspiring artists.</p>
