<h2>What's in Premium?</h2>

<p>In the premium lesson, you'll learn the <strong>egg principle</strong> in painting, a technique used by masters like Rembrandt to create a glowing effect in portraits. You'll understand how to apply this principle by visualizing an egg under a light source, focusing on the transition from light to shadow. The lesson covers how to maintain the lightest point at the top of the head and gradually darken as you move down, ensuring highlights align with the light source. You'll also explore Rembrandt's meticulous use of this principle to achieve subtle transitions and a three-dimensional glow in his work.</p>
