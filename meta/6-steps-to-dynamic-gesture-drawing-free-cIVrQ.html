<h2>What's in Premium?</h2>

<p>In this premium lesson, you'll learn how to master gesture drawing by focusing on movement and rhythm. We explore what gesture is and why it's essential for creating convincing figures. The lesson covers the importance of asymmetry and how offsetting the apexes of curves generates natural rhythm and interest.</p>

<p>You'll discover a step-by-step approach to gesture drawing:</p>

<ol>

<li><strong>Starting with the head</strong> as a simple shape.</li>

<li><strong>Drawing the spine</strong> with four lines to represent the neck, upper back, front of the body, and lower back.</li>

<li><strong>Indicating the pelvis</strong>, focusing on the weight-bearing side.</li>

<li><strong>Adding limbs</strong> with 2-3 lines each, ensuring they connect smoothly.</li>

<li><strong>Using wrapping lines</strong> to show 3D form and tilt.</li>

</ol>

<p>We also provide tips on emphasizing movement using C-curves and S-curves, simplifying feet and hands, and maintaining dynamic flow in your lines. The lesson includes advice on practicing at your own pace, using line weight for depth, checking proportions, and assessing balance.</p>

<p>By the end of the lesson, you'll be encouraged to personalize your gesture drawing process, using these concepts as a framework to develop your own style.</p>
