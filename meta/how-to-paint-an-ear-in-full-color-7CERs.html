<p>Congratulations! You've made it to the final section of the ear chapter. As promised, we're going to do a full-color rendering of this beautiful ear. If you've watched the other chapters, you'll know that the first thing I like to do when approaching a painting is <strong>adding a color wash</strong>.</p>

<h2>Step 1: Adding a Color Wash</h2>

<p>I typically start with either cadmium orange or cadmium red. For this image, I'm choosing <strong>cad red orange</strong> since we have a lot of subsurface scattering and dark accents. That's where you want the canvas to come through if it does. I'll set the opacity to <strong>96%</strong>.</p>

<h2>Step 2: Rough Gesture Drawing</h2>

<p>Next, I do a rough gesture drawing. I select a line color that's still colorized by moving the color wheel into the darker range with about <strong>40% saturation</strong> of orange or red. I'll keep the drawing on its own layer. Initially, I like to keep everything on separate layers so I can quickly make corrections if needed.</p>

<p>I start by drawing the <strong>back line of the jaw and cheekbone</strong> where we'll attach the ear shape. Then, I indicate the <strong>brow line</strong>, which shows us where the top of the ear should go.</p>

<h3>Drawing the Ear Shape</h3>

<p>I begin with a <strong>bass clef shape</strong> to capture the initial gesture of the ear. Then, I break up the interior shapes:</p>

<ul>

<li>Use a large <strong>hook shape</strong> to describe the inner lines of the helix.</li>

<li>Add a smaller hook shape that feeds into the base of the larger hook.</li>

<li>Draw another small hook shape to describe the tragus, which feeds back into the anterior portion of the helix.</li>

</ul>

<p>I use <strong>straights to define the secondary shapes</strong> of the silhouette of the ear. Straights add a nice sense of structure to the sketch, and they contrast well with curves for a stronger design.</p>

<h3>Mapping Lights and Darks</h3>

<p>Since we'll spend a decent amount of time rendering this, I map out the <strong>separation of lights and darks</strong>. I fill in the <strong>concha</strong>, block in the <strong>sideburn</strong>, and tuck the <strong>hair behind the ear</strong>. I add the <strong>cast shadow at the bottom of the ear</strong> and fill it in with a rough value.</p>

<h3>Drawing the Earrings</h3>

<p>I indicate where the earrings are piercing into the ear with little dots. Then, I rough in the rings. They don't have to be perfect at this stage.</p>

<h3>Adjusting the Drawing</h3>

<p>I lighten the wash a bit so it's easier to see the line work. I check the <strong>line layer</strong> to ensure I don't have any opaque paint that would obstruct any underlying colors. It's important to keep a clean sketch.</p>

<h2>Organizing Layers in Photoshop</h2>

<p>I'm using Photoshop, and I have my <strong>line layer</strong> and my <strong>wash layer</strong>. If I want to just look at my line work, I hold down <strong>Alt</strong> and click on the eye icon of the layer. This shows me what's on that layer and nothing else. It's a handy trick to check your line work.</p>

<p>I label my layers to stay organized:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Line Layer</strong></li>

<li><strong>Wash Layer</strong></li>

<li><strong>Local Colors Layer</strong></li>

<li><strong>Lights and Darks Layer</strong></li>

</ul>

<h2>Step 3: Blocking in Flat Local Colors</h2>

<p>I create another layer between the wash and the line layers to block out <strong>flat local colors</strong>. I switch to my textured square brush and find the local color for the flesh tones. It looks like there's a bit more ochre in her skin than red, so I move the color slider up towards the <strong>oranges</strong>.</p>

<p>I adjust the color until it feels right, not too saturated or too bright. I add a little more red so it doesn't feel too chalky. I use this as my base color.</p>

<h3>Blocking in Colors</h3>

<p>I fill in the <strong>skin</strong>, the <strong>earrings</strong> (which have a gold color), and the <strong>hair</strong>. For the earrings, I make them darker so they stand out from the skin tone. For the hair, which is a dark brown or black, I lighten it up a bit so I have the liberty to accentuate the dark accents later.</p>

<p>To keep things simple and to give us less to worry about, I follow the <strong>composition or aspect ratio of the reference image</strong>. I crop out any superfluous space to focus on the ear.</p>

<h2>Step 4: Separating Lights and Darks</h2>

<p>I create a new layer between the <strong>local colors</strong> and the <strong>line</strong> layer, for the <strong>separation of lights and darks</strong>. I'm not worrying about gradients, highlights, or dark accents yet, just separating the graphic dark shapes and the graphic light shapes.</p>

<h3>Painting Shadow Shapes</h3>

<p>I start by painting the <strong>shadow shapes within the ear</strong>. These shadows are more saturated and move towards the reds because the ear has a lot of blood vessels, and the thinner skin allows more red to show through.</p>

<p>I fill in the <strong>cast shadows</strong> under the sideburns, the <strong>shadow shapes</strong> of the rings, and add the little shadow shapes from the hair strands. Even though the hair's local color is already quite dark, I can still subtly paint in the shadows.</p>

<h2>Step 5: Adding Midtones and Highlights</h2>

<p>I create another layer between the <strong>line</strong> and the <strong>lights and darks</strong> layer to start pulling out some of the <strong>highlights and midtones</strong>.</p>

<h3>Highlighting the Hair</h3>

<p>I block in the highlight on the hair. Using the <strong>lasso tool</strong>, I select the zigzag highlight we're seeing in the hair. I'll go back in and vary the shape a little bit. I'm keeping it pretty graphic still. The longer you can keep your rendering in <strong>flat graphic shapes</strong>, the better.</p>

<h3>Adjusting the Drawing Layer</h3>

<p>I colorize the drawing layer and lighten it, approximating the cad red and cad orange. I keep it dark enough to still see the underlying drawing. At this point, I can start painting on top of the line work and the other layers.</p>

<h3>Collapsing Layers</h3>

<p>I use the hotkey <strong>Shift + Ctrl + Alt + E</strong> to flatten all the layers and compile them into one layer, without destroying the previous layers. This allows me to use <strong>blender brushes</strong>.</p>

<h3>Using Blender Brushes</h3>

<p>Blender brushes are very useful. I soften edges and clean up some of the strokes using the blender brush. Even though we started with graphic shapes with clean hard edges, we can soften them up to get a more realistic feel.</p>

<h2>Step 6: Punching Dark Accents and Subsurface Scattering</h2>

<p>Now, I start punching some of the <strong>dark accents</strong>. I keep the saturation high and move further down into the darker colors. I add dark accents in areas like the <strong>inner folds of the ear</strong>, the <strong>cast shadows</strong>, and other places where the darkest darks occur.</p>

<h3>Adding Subsurface Scattering</h3>

<p>I begin to pull out the <strong>subsurface scattering</strong>. You can see some of it along the <strong>helix</strong>, the <strong>lobule</strong>, and near the <strong>cast shadows</strong>. These are the hot areas of saturation where the light is being trapped and scattered under the skin due to the many capillaries in the ear.</p>

<h2>Step 7: Adding Highlights</h2>

<p>I start to <strong>punch the highlights</strong>. I experiment with using <strong>magentas</strong>, <strong>blues</strong>, <strong>lavenders</strong>, and <strong>cyan</strong> to see how they feel. The cool colors contrast nicely with the warm shadows.</p>

<p>I adjust as needed, sometimes toning down the magentas if they aren't working. I may use the color slider to find the right hue.</p>

<h2>Enhancing the Rendering</h2>

<p>I adjust the redness of the ear to reflect the capillaries and blood flow. Ears are typically more red due to the many blood vessels. I want to make sure this is represented accurately.</p>

<h3>Cleaning Up Line Work</h3>

<p>I paint over the cast shadows to keep the area consistent. Sometimes it's faster to repaint an area than trying to paint around existing line work or brushwork.</p>

<h2>Step 8: Final Touches</h2>

<p>I push the rendering further, adding more form and depth. I add texture and highlights in the hair, giving it more life.</p>

<h3>Adding Peach Fuzz</h3>

<p>I notice a little bit of peach fuzz on the back of her neck, so I add a few marks to indicate that.</p>

<h3>Creating a Rough Border</h3>

<p>To keep this feeling sketchy, I create a rough border around the painting. It helps frame the piece and emphasizes that it's a study.</p>

<h3>Strengthening Highlights</h3>

<p>I strengthen the highlights a bit more, especially where they're the hottest. I use <strong>cyan</strong> in areas closest to the light source but avoid overdoing it.</p>

<h3>Carving Straights</h3>

<p>I carve out some of the <strong>straights</strong> to contrast with the curves. This adds structure and variety to the piece.</p>

<h2>Recap of the Process</h2>

<p>Let's review the steps we went over:</p>

<ol>

<li><strong>Wash</strong>: Started with a cad red orange color wash at 96% opacity.</li>

<li><strong>Gesture Drawing</strong>: Created a rough gesture drawing using a colorized line.</li>

<li><strong>Local Colors</strong>: Blocked out flat local colors for the skin, earrings, and hair.</li>

<li><strong>Separation of Lights and Darks</strong>: Mapped out shadows and lights on separate layers.</li>

<li><strong>Midtones and Highlights</strong>: Added midtones and highlights, focusing on the graphic shapes.</li>

<li><strong>Subsurface Scattering and Occlusion</strong>: Added subsurface scattering in areas like the helix and lobule, and dark accents in areas of occlusion.</li>

<li><strong>Final Touches</strong>: Strengthened highlights, added texture, and enhanced the overall rendering.</li>

</ol>

<h3>Areas of Occlusion</h3>

<p>The <strong>areas of occlusion</strong> include:</p>

<ul>

<li>Inside the <strong>concha</strong></li>

<li>Under the <strong>tragus</strong></li>

<li>Behind the <strong>antitragus</strong></li>

<li>At the base of the <strong>earlobe</strong></li>

</ul>

<h3>Balancing Brushwork</h3>

<p>When doing your brushwork, aim for a good balance of <strong>large, medium, and small brushstrokes</strong>. Look for opportunities to create that balance and design with big, medium, and small. Also, look for opportunities to have <strong>straights against curves</strong> where it makes sense.</p>

<h2>Anatomy Review</h2>

<p>Let's quickly review the anatomy of the ear:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Tragus</strong></li>

<li><strong>Antitragus</strong></li>

<li><strong>Earlobe (Lobule)</strong></li>

<li><strong>Concha</strong></li>

<li><strong>Helix</strong></li>

<li><strong>Antihelix</strong></li>

</ul>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p>That sums up the ear rendering. We've gone over the entire process from start to finish. Now, we'll move on to the <strong>lips chapter</strong>. I'll save this work, and I'll see you in the next chapter.</p>
