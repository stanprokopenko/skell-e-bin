<p>People often want to learn how to draw the head. There's a common interest in methods like those of Andrew Lumis, George Bridgeman, or the Riley method. These methods are useful, but it's not always necessary to follow them strictly.</p>

<h2>Flexibility in Drawing Methods</h2>

<p>There's an over-obsession with specific artists and methods. Deviating from these methods can be beneficial. You can use influences from caricature, fine art, comic book art, or artists like John Singer Sargent. The Lumis method, especially the rule of thirds, can sometimes complicate drawing. For example, a student's drawing might stick to the rule of thirds, but if the reference has a longer nose and a downward gaze, it causes deviation. Lumis is a good base, but strict adherence can lead to distortions, especially in extreme perspectives. No single strategy is universally better; different methods solve different problems.</p>

<h2>Practical Examples and Strategies</h2>

<p>For a 3/4 head drawing, I might use Lumis strategies, starting with a circle, building the jaw, and using Riley abstraction for the eyes. The goal is to get an impression, not exact accuracy. For less ideal angles, I might start with an envelope, blocking in shapes and refining them. Correct portrait drawing is about making the right decisions, not drawing fast. Practice and awareness of different strategies help solve specific problems.</p>

<h2>Importance of Practice and Application</h2>

<p>The video title suggests not relying solely on rules in art. Breaking rules can lead to cool artwork, as seen in comic art with exaggerated anatomy. Practical application of skills to creative projects is crucial. Studying specific artists is helpful but has diminishing returns. Application of knowledge defines an artist's skill. Different art focuses require different knowledge; for example, anatomy for character artists vs. environment design for 3D concept artists. Diversifying and focusing on personal artistic goals prevents wasted study time. Learning comes from practice and solving specific problems, not just studying figures.</p>

<h2>Subjectivity in Art and Personal Goals</h2>

<p>Drawing incorporates various influences from an artist's career. Art is subjective; teachers may not know exactly what works for each student. Implied anatomy and flowy lines can be used, similar to Riley abstraction and gesture methods. Understanding concepts like the rule of thirds takes years of practice. Different drawing methods are valid, depending on personal choice.</p>
