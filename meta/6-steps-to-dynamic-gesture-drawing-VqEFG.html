<h2>Understanding Gesture</h2>

<p>Sometimes it's really hard to even know what <strong>gesture</strong> is or why we should use it. Figures always feel the most convincing to me when they exhibit a type of <strong>movement</strong>. We appreciate abstraction, and <strong>asymmetry</strong> is a fantastic choice to create interest in our drawings.</p>

<p>The way I think about this is that anytime I have a curve with its apex offset to a curve below that has its apex slightly shifted, I create a natural interest in the viewer's attention. This is very different from what I almost always see people making in gesture drawings, where they might just go through the outside and draw the same thing, resulting in stiff and symmetrical figures.</p>

<h2>Asymmetry and Rhythm in Gesture Drawing</h2>

<p>I try to consciously avoid <strong>parallel forms</strong> because they create closure. Instead, I focus on <strong>asymmetry</strong> to create <strong>rhythm</strong>. It's not about drawing the outside of the leg or the back of the leg, it's about an idea of its position. Primarily, the idea is asymmetry for the creation of rhythm.</p>

<p>Everyone has something different to say about rhythm. For me, <strong>every line represents a part</strong>, and the <strong>spacing between lines represents the joint</strong> or the transition between parts. That's the most developed connection I'm making. It's not the front, it's not the back, it's not the contour. Every line equals the simplified, abstracted idea of the part, and I focus on creating movement through that offset relationship of apexes to create an experience.</p>

<p>You'll notice the difference if I were to do the same curves but pull them out a little bit. It feels like there's a lack of rhythm or a slight drop-off of rhythm. That's asking the viewer too much.</p>

<h2>My Gesture Drawing Process</h2>

<h3>Starting with the Head and Spine</h3>

<p>I like to start with the <strong>head</strong>. For me, the head is a great opportunity to begin with a natural focal point. I'll then move through the <strong>spine</strong>. I do this with four lines:</p>

<ol>

<li><strong>Cervical (neck) curve</strong></li>

<li><strong>Thoracic (upper back) curve</strong></li>

<li><strong>Stretching of the front of the body</strong></li>

<li><strong>Lumbar (lower back) curve</strong></li>

</ol>

<p>From there, I move into the <strong>weight-bearing side of the pelvis</strong>, which usually gets one line.</p>

<h3>Drawing the Limbs</h3>

<p>From the weight-bearing side of the pelvis, if possible, I go into the <strong>weight-bearing leg</strong>. Each limb for me is about <strong>two to three lines</strong>. Then I work on the <strong>supporting leg</strong>, consciously making a different emphasis on where weight is in the body. Finally, I move into the <strong>arms</strong>, which are the same, two to three lines each.</p>

<p>In total, if you feel lost or confused with your gesture, my gestures are about <strong>16 to 17 lines</strong>. Every gesture process is unique to the person using it. I think you should have a couple, and each should be a different tool to allow you to get what you want out of an image.</p>

<h2>Applying the Technique: An Example</h2>

<p>I'll try to explain why I'm making the decisions I am.</p>

<p>First, I start with the <strong>head</strong>, a simple ball for now. Then, I work into the <strong>spine</strong>, but I'm not analyzing the outside. Instead, I'm drawing my understanding of the inside, drawing the <strong>idea</strong>. I'm trying to connect with the technique.</p>

<p>What would the spine be doing? If we look at the big spatial directions, even though the head is turned, the spine would still be pushing the neck forward. Then, the thoracic spine would be going back, and then forward again, which would explain why I'm seeing the thoracic arch pushing against the skin.</p>

<p>So, the neck is doing that, the head is turning off it, and the spine is this big <strong>S-curve</strong>. I can see the tilt of the pelvis, and the lumbar region would be going a certain way. When I'm approaching a gesture drawing, this is what I'm thinking. I'm drawing the inside to make the drawing.</p>

<h3>Simplifying Parts into Lines</h3>

<p>Every line is a simplification of a <strong>part</strong>, and they connect in space at the <strong>joints</strong>. So, I'm going to say the neck goes this way, aiming to make these lines central to forms. Notice how that is an echo of that direction. The thoracic spine goes this way, so I'm starting to pick up on that movement of the body forward, just like I showed you in that little spine diagram.</p>

<p>I've done two lines so far, the cervical and thoracic curves. I like to add a third one, which is not the spine, but instead is the <strong>stretching of the front of the body</strong>. Especially if we're standing, you get this beautiful counter-curve from the taller curvature of the back to the lower pitch or peak of that curve, to the stretch.</p>

<p>So, my steps here are for me because I screw things up all the time. I can double-check and go back. If something looks stiff, I can ask why.</p>

<h3>Drawing the Pelvis and Legs</h3>

<p>Next is the <strong>pelvis</strong>. Where's the <strong>weight-bearing side</strong>? I'm always looking for the high side because if we put weight on one side of our pelvis, it shifts up. That's a great way to catch that imbalance or asymmetry of curves. It's not always the case, though.</p>

<p>Now, how would I move and maintain rhythm from that hip into the <strong>femur</strong>? The same thing, that's the part of the femur. Is that the outside of the femur or the hip? It's not the outside drawings here. So, the femur goes this way. When I have a <strong>bent leg</strong>, that's when I get closer to the <strong>three lines</strong> because I do one for the femur, maybe a little transition line for the <strong>knee</strong>, and then down into my <strong>lower leg</strong>.</p>

<h3>Drawing the Feet</h3>

<p>The basic idea of the <strong>foot</strong> is a <strong>triangle</strong>. It's a good shape because we want to have some kind of stability and contact with the ground. I always try to keep this with some type of movement or dynamism.</p>

<h4>Different Views of the Foot</h4>

<ul>

<li><strong>Front View</strong>: A simple triangle.</li>

<li><strong>Three-Quarter View</strong>: Move the triangle over, showing more of the side.</li>

<li><strong>Profile View</strong>: Same shape without the front.</li>

<li><strong>Back View</strong>: Similar principle as the three-quarter view but with the heel straight across.</li>

</ul>

<p>If I see a pose where the foot is up and arched, I know this is the model I want. I can then advance that gesture, pushing and stretching the shape as needed.</p>

<h2>Wrapping Lines and 3D Tilt</h2>

<p>What is the basic <strong>3D tilt</strong> of each part? I'm going to use <strong>wrapping lines</strong>, think of them like rubber bands wrapping around cylinders.</p>

<ul>

<li>The <strong>head</strong> might be leaned back slightly.</li>

<li>The <strong>neck</strong> comes forward.</li>

<li>The <strong>rib cage</strong> comes out.</li>

<li>The <strong>pelvis</strong> tilts a certain way.</li>

</ul>

<p>Each part now has a bit of information about the perspective. This becomes more important when I'm trying to solve for <strong>foreshortening</strong>. We can't really do that in gesture because we don't have shapes, but this is about the best we get from it.</p>

<h2>Drawing the Arms</h2>

<p>Arms are the same, <strong>two to three lines</strong>. The only thing you need to ask is how would I build off what's already there? The only thing that's important to me is that <strong>every line leads you to every other line</strong>.</p>

<p>Maybe I could build the <strong>shoulder</strong> off the neck line. I ensure that lines connect and flow into each other. For the <strong>forearm and hand</strong>, I usually make them <strong>one line</strong>. It's very rare that I would do something dramatically different because we expect that syncing of the forearm and hand.</p>

<h2>Ensuring Rhythm and Movement</h2>

<p>Throughout my drawing, I make sure that there is <strong>asymmetry</strong> in the curves and that <strong>no line is vertical or horizontal</strong>. Every curve exists on a <strong>diagonal</strong>. This helps keep the figure active and full of motion.</p>

<h2>Checking Proportions and Center of Gravity</h2>

<p>You can <strong>check your proportions</strong> by seeing if the top is the same height as the bottom, and aim for <strong>eight heads tall</strong>. The value of this stage in a drawing is that I can decide if I want to move forward or not. If this looks like something I want, great, spend your time developing it. If not, you only spent a minute, do another one and try something different.</p>

<p>One thing you can do is find the <strong>center of gravity</strong>. If you look at the <strong>pit of the neck</strong> and plumb a line down, if this center of gravity line is close to the medial ankle, that's a pretty balanced pose.</p>

<h2>Gesture Drawing Practice</h2>

<p>It's common in drawing classes to do these really quickly, usually in a minute or two. There's always this emphasis on getting it done quickly, and that's fine, but <strong>speed comes with practice</strong>. If it takes you five minutes to get here, and you feel good about it, that's awesome. There's no real emphasis or need to get time.</p>

<p>The reason I would make the time brief is to <strong>force people to repeat</strong>. So, if you do two minutes and in two minutes you get through the spine but you do it really well, that would be fantastic.</p>

<h2>Personal Style and Innovation</h2>

<p>I don't believe that your drawing needs to produce the product view of the image that you have in your mind immediately. That's amazing, but it's not really how I think of gesture.</p>

<p>I always encourage people to <strong>change and adapt their poses</strong>. Who cares if you drew what was there? Who's going to know? Nobody will ever know what the model looks like, they're only going to care if the drawing is interesting to them. If you've made a cool drawing, people will love it.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p>In this approach, I've combined prior lessons into one focused exercise, keeping us under that umbrella of <strong>16 or 17 lines</strong>. I don't have to do anything new, the same organization of lines works from just about all angles.</p>

<p>Hi, I'm <strong>Stephen Michael Hampton</strong>, and in this course, what I'm working on is trying to approach gesture in a way that students can find accessible, with a focus and emphasis on <strong>organizing your thoughts</strong> and making gesture something that doesn't have to be mysterious or ambiguous. I'm giving it some structure and some steps, but I'm also trying to keep it open enough where you can approach it from a couple of different styles and, more than anything, have an <strong>understanding of why you're doing it</strong>.</p>

<p>Sometimes it's really hard to even know what gesture is or why you should use it or what kind of role it might have in your drawing. I put a lot of emphasis in this course on trying to help you build a <strong>framework</strong> to think about what the subject of study is, even before we jump into the technical side of things.</p>

<p>In this course, you're going to learn <strong>how to pose your figures</strong>, <strong>how to think about the internal dynamics</strong> of your figures, <strong>proportion</strong>, <strong>how to think about design</strong>, and how you might want your figure to look slightly different based on what you want to prioritize in the final result of what you intend to make.</p>

<p>At the end of this course, you should come away with a couple of different approaches to think about gesture, and I hope a broad enough understanding of the subject to make your own <strong>innovations</strong> on it. I don't want you to draw exactly like me. I want you to draw in <strong>your own style</strong> but take from this course the components that might help you make that style the clearest and the most communicative that you can for the kinds of stories that you create with your figures.</p>
