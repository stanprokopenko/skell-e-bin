<h2>What's in Premium?</h2>

<p>In the premium lesson, you'll learn how organizing values into strong, connected shapes can transform your drawings. This approach improves readability, adds depth, and commands attention. We'll explore the concept of value groups as <strong>oceans, lakes, and rivers</strong> to unify your compositions.</p>

<p>You'll discover how to balance 2D composition with 3D form by thinking like a designer, ensuring every shape enhances both the arrangement and volume of your work. We'll also cover strategies for dealing with <strong>floaters</strong>—isolated shapes that can distract the viewer—and how to integrate them into your value groups for a cohesive look.</p>

<p>The lesson includes a step-by-step assignment where you'll apply these concepts by creating a portrait study using defined value ranges. This hands-on practice will help solidify your understanding and improve your ability to organize values effectively.</p>
