<h2>Deleting the Complex</h2>

<p>Welcome back. Today, we're going to delete the complex. Let's get rid of that stuff. It's no good to us. We will never draw a complex drawing. It will always be simple, built on simple, built on simple, and to the untrained eye, look very complex, but for some reason also beautiful and fluid.</p>

<p>So let's keep it that way. Let's keep that magic in our hands. The fluid idea of gesture connecting forms.</p>

<h2>The Bean Bag Analogy</h2>

<p>We'll look at the bean bag, you know it's a classic, and the bean bag folds in the middle. We're going to do a lot of folding around here and moving up on.</p>

<h2>Learning to Love Hands</h2>

<p>And of course, there's no avoiding it. And why should we? <strong>Let's learn to love hands.</strong> We'll throw some hands in between figure drawing just to shake it up a little bit and keep ourselves fresh. It's very easy to lose the power of drawing the hand from drawing lots of quick sketches where they're mostly just sticks on the end of a pad. So let's get some hands in between.</p>

<p>We'll explore anticipation, things like that. <strong>Let's get our voice into these drawings.</strong> And once again, all the minutia is there for you to explore. So let's get into it, let's have fun with it, and let's draw with the power of osmosis. Good luck!</p>

<h2>Taking It Up a Notch</h2>

<p>Alright, let's take it up a notch. We've done lots of drawings by this point, and we are well versed in the shapes and the design, <strong>Mr. T, Mrs. V</strong>, common language now, brought into the pencil, the little beanbag shapes of the Liberty Bell and the tube that becomes an egg.</p>

<p>So in goes Mrs. V. What we're going to do here is make it a little bit more complex, a little bit more of the overlapping shapes and the foreshortening that comes from those moments. We'll start simply enough. We'll think mostly about <strong>structure</strong> here of a sitting figure.</p>

<h3>Repetition and Understanding</h3>

<p>What you can do always, you're looking at the very simple here, is <strong>keep repeating this very simple thing until you understand it well enough to take it to the next level</strong> which is coming at you very shortly. And you can also, with this entire workshop, go back to scratch again and do the first lessons all over before you get to here.</p>

<p><strong>Watch, listen, draw, repeat</strong> is the way to go. It is all about <strong>mileage</strong> to get you into the flow of drawing with incredible confidence and without fear.</p>

<p>When we walk into a life draw class, for instance, everything's terrifying. We don't know what's happening. The model's not the same as before. Can't see the bones. Just see the outline of the figure. <strong>And that's plenty for us.</strong></p>

<h3>Looking for Bones First</h3>

<p>We can always see where the tenth rib is. We can always see where the hip crest is. We can see all these <strong>landmarks</strong>. So <strong>look for bones first</strong>. The head's always going to be an obvious thing because it's mostly bone. Very little flesh on the head.</p>

<h3>Dealing with Perspective</h3>

<p>And you can see here we're looking up at the figure. Now the dynamics are changing. <strong>Drawing the figure is eternal.</strong> It's never going to be the same pose, ever. Not exactly. You might say, "Oh, there's a sitting pose." But the limbs are going to be in a different position. The model is going to be a different shape. All of those things.</p>

<p>But what's always there for us is Mr. T and Mrs. V. Even in this very foreshortened view. So you notice that Mr. T, the bar, the handlebars, are very... So the clavicle furthest from us is very much in the distance.</p>

<h2>Using Value and Line</h2>

<p>So you can think of gigantic figures and treat them like that. These are massive distances in a giant's perspective. I'll put lots of distance in as far as <strong>values</strong> are concerned when I'm drawing a figure. It gives the impression that the figure is from a different world.</p>

<p>One of the big gifts we have with our what seem very limited tools is that we can make <strong>value, line and proportion</strong> do whatever we want it to do, and the camera can't. The camera only records what it sees, and that's where we see the difference.</p>

<h3>The Artist's Voice</h3>

<p><strong>The artist's voice is a different voice every time.</strong> ** The camera's voice is always the same voice. A great photographer can light things. That's why they were so prized in Hollywood. It's more the lighting. When you see a great movie, how it looks so beautiful, that's the cinematographer. Sets up the cameras and the lights.</p>

<p>So we can do the same thing. In fact, most life draw classes are very poorly lit. They're lit from every angle so that the students can see. There's chairs all the way around the model, so they need to be lit from every angle. Otherwise, the people with a back view would have just darkness to look at.</p>

<h3>Choosing Shadows</h3>

<p>So when I get that kind of thing happening where there's multiple shadows going on because there's multiple lights, <strong>I just choose one</strong>. I'll say the drop shadow here, if there's four of them, is the one I'm going to use, and I'll use that for everything and cancel out the other three shadows.</p>

<p>You might go, "I don't see all those shadows," but you will do. Some of them are more faint than others. <strong>Pick the one that's the most obviously strongest.</strong></p>

<h2>Drawing the Head at an Angle</h2>

<p>So I'll put in this head at that angle. It is a challenge. All of this drawing is a challenge now. Little droopy features on the left there was easy, wasn't it? And it's good to keep that there in mind so that when we do the next stuff on this side here, then we always have that to check back and say <strong>it's not that hard</strong>, it's really just these simple shapes, but now they're turned, and they're coming at us in different positions.</p>

<h3>Drawing Legs and Foreshortening</h3>

<p>Like the leg that's tucking under the further leg, that thigh is coming toward us, and then the calf is going away from us. Because that foot now is going to go behind that leg. There's our first tricky bit of business to deal with, apart from the head being pulled back and up.</p>

<h3>The Effect of Breath on the Figure</h3>

<p>And when someone takes a breath, like this model is doing here, then the breasts get pulled up with that breath. So underneath that chest, this is a diaphragm and lungs, and in the middle of the chest where we see the V, and that's flexible. That's all cartilage bone. We can expand our chest, and that's what's happening there.</p>

<h2>Using Broad Pencil Strokes</h2>

<p>We already have a realistic face there, and it's just based on the idea of <strong>broad pencil strokes</strong> and then <strong>thin lines</strong> for the top of the lip, for instance. Broad line for underneath the top of that lip. And you can keep the eye pretty vague. We know it gets darker in the place where the eye sits, and so it's lighter on the outskirts of that.</p>

<p>And it gives the illusion of lots going on when there's very little going on. The viewer will fill it all in for you. And once again, that is the <strong>holy grail</strong> where the artist only says enough, and then the viewer says the rest.</p>

<h3>Simplifying the Face</h3>

<p>It's very hard to do. It's hard to pull back to that because the ego will always interfere and say, "Put more in, show off." Probably leave that face like that, but let's see how much ego comes back into this.</p>

<h3>The Ulna Bone and Arm Anatomy</h3>

<p>So there goes the ulna bone. The arm is hinged, and so it is coming in toward the body again after going away from the body at the top. So we see ulna punch out. And we start to see the flexors appear on either side of the brachioradialis and the palmaris muscle side of the hand, the thumb is. So the flexors are just disappearing behind that ridge, and then the bone is in front of it, the radius bone.</p>

<p>And look at all that stuff all in just a line.</p>

<h3>Women's Legs and Calves</h3>

<p>Now <strong>women's legs are incredibly powerful</strong> at the bottom. So once they compress those calves, look how much bulge takes place there. Really sensational. I would know that was a woman's leg if I blocked out the rest of the figure. Because a man's leg does not look like that in the calf area. That is definitely a woman's lower leg.</p>

<h2>Drawing Figures from Different Angles</h2>

<p>And let's do another one. Let's really arch back that back. Remember, if we pull up with that high-waisted swimsuit idea and just drop down a touch, then we get that three-finger gap, and we can push the leg out from there.</p>

<p>Now the gluteus are being compressed onto a seat here or a block, whatever you like, and then the biceps femoris pull with gravity down below that box.</p>

<h3>Pushing the Arms Back</h3>

<p>Let's pull the arms back here for some support and push the hand onto that box. Nice! See that? In a very simple manner, nothing complicated at all. <strong>Pulling that shoulder around, and we have wider at the top and more narrow coming down to the wrist.</strong></p>

<p>And you've seen what I like to do. I like to <strong>orbit the head around what the body is doing</strong>. And so with that kind of pose, we push the neck out to get some balance there. So the balance is no longer on the weight-bearing leg. It's on that arm. So we could say both legs are relaxed now, and the arm is taking the weight of this structure all on its own.</p>

<h3>Finding Rhythms in the Body</h3>

<p>And there's the curviest part of the breast resting on the ribcage, seventh and eighth rib coming down to the tenth and eleventh. And <strong>lovely little rhythms</strong> here to find as the rest of the stuff.</p>

<p>There's the pinch of the pectoralis, and we're moving on to find the biceps there. So the biceps go underneath both those structures. So the deltoid is king, goes on top of the pectoralis, and the <strong>bicep goes underneath both</strong>, attaches to the scapula.</p>

<h3>Simplifying Hands</h3>

<p>There's a carpal ramp, and we're pushing out now for the metacarpals and down to the phalanges. They're just sticks at this point. And put the thumb in and bend the thumb in toward the hand. That shortens things off. The knuckle itself will lead us down to the webbing. So this hand is both closed and turned.</p>

<p>So you can see the <strong>power of osmosis</strong> at play here. The head is up, the ears are down, and the eyes are a broad stroke. Many times we do this.</p>

<h3>Using Broad Strokes on the Face</h3>

<p>And now the digastric plane, what's under the chin, is a broad stroke too. And within those broad strokes, it's easier to place smaller things. You can see how easily that little muzzle went in there, and those eyes.</p>

<p>So the broad stroke there represents the eye bottom and the eyebrows as well. And pulling back here for a little hairdo, and pulling the hair down for gravity.</p>

<h3>Designing Hair with Gravity</h3>

<p>So when you're <strong>designing hair</strong>, you have to think about a lot of things. You've got to think about gravity. You've got to think about the environment. If it's windy, it is going to be dramatic. I love to paint or draw a witch with her hair blowing wild in the wind, especially red hair, so dramatic, like flames.</p>

<h3>The Importance of Pencil Manipulation</h3>

<p>So coming down with this broad pencil and using the <strong>broad of the pencil</strong>, especially if you do it lightly, will give you less to worry about approximating where lines are going to be because you can fit into that broad stroke easier than tweaking around with very fine lines like I've just done there for the stomach. But at the same time, I'm able to do that.</p>

<p>You saw me go from the sacrum down to the gluteus because I've done it many times, and it was a broad stroke followed by a fine line, and that's the <strong>manipulation of the pencil</strong>, and that's why I like the pencil lead just so. That length is perfect for me. <strong>Find out what's perfect for you.</strong></p>

<h3>Drawing Both Figures on a Page</h3>

<p>Now we've got two figures on a page here, both relatively the same in proportion because I'm chasing the same model around to see what it looks like on the other side. That's a great discipline. <strong>Do not fear it.</strong> You don't have to proportionally match them. Just understand the <strong>three dimensions</strong> that we're looking at.</p>

<p>And really, if you go all the way around, you'll see every single side and understand the entire figure as a living, breathing thing, rather than this flat thing that sits on the surface of a 2D page.</p>

<h3>Drawing Through the Figure</h3>

<p>There's nothing like it because you can trace these little things around, meaning you can scope them out like the clavicles now on this figure compared to the clavicles on the other figure are very compressed in perspective.</p>

<p>And now you can see the good old brachioradialis coming up to meet the center of the humerus bone and say hello to the deltoid because they share the same plane, the side of the humerus. And where that ends is where the triceps begin. So once you've got those boundaries, you understand how things work in three dimensions, and you understand also how to use your pencil in the most expedient manner.</p>

<h2>Simplifying the Hand</h2>

<p>So here's the hand. <strong>Think of the hand as dimensional</strong> as well. So the hand is thick. It's not a thin thing. Once again, we could be duped into thinking that by drawing little stick fingers all the time.</p>

<p>So I've come in close here to show that the hand coming at us has got big metacarpal condyles on it. And then we step onto the finger, and the finger is fitting into those joints. And so each joint is one size smaller each time. So the biggest joints are the punching knuckles, and then the finger steps down to get another joint that's not so big.</p>

<p>It's hard to get your head around them, how they're working, but they're basically on a swivel. They're swiveling up and down. So they meet with the hand extended, and then we get a ridge as the fingers bend inwards, and we see the face of the knuckle now rather than just the top of it.</p>

<h3>Understanding Hands</h3>

<p><strong>Hands are so hard.</strong> Everyone acknowledges that. But the more we do of them, the more we understand them in dimension, the easier it is.</p>

<p>This hand has gone in quite quickly with those ideas, and I got that dimensional quality with a broad pencil stroke to begin with, just like we did with the eyes. And remember the <strong>webbing</strong>. The webbing is on both sides. It's mostly underneath, but you feel the pinch of flesh above that reacts like webbing. So that's the pinch on that finger that goes around the knuckles. So the knuckles fit in between those.</p>

<h3>The Thumb and Finger Proportions</h3>

<p>You've got to always think of the human body and its skin as well, especially up close like this. So I spun from the wrist all the way around the index finger and thought about the thumb separately, and that's not a bad ploy. <strong>The thumb is the trickiest thing</strong>, in my estimation.</p>

<p>So you take the thumb off and just think of the knuckle part, tire up the hand there, then the punching knuckles. You could say halfway, but from all different directions it looks different. From this position here, somewhere in that region.</p>

<p>Now that big swell I've just done there is the first interosseous muscle, and it's a big thick pad between the thumb and the index finger, and there's interosseous muscles between the fingers too. They basically put the fingers wide and the thumb as well.</p>

<h3>The Thumb is Big</h3>

<p>I've overstated the upper bones, the radius and the ulna, to show that there's more give on the ulna side than there is on the radius side. The radius is closer to your hand, and the radius is the blade shape. Turn your own hand. Try and keep your forearm straight but just move your hand and see how much you can push toward the pinky side and how little toward the thumb side.</p>

<p>Now from underneath, we have that big <strong>hypothenar eminence</strong>. Now this is a three-quarter view, but the hypothenar eminence on the little finger side is longish. It goes all the way up to the top of the knuckles, and the thenar eminence, which is the thumb, goes about halfway up, but it takes up most of the palm as far as bulk is concerned.</p>

<p>And I think about the wrist down to the first big knuckle of the thumb as half and half to the end of the thumb. So basically, the thumb right down to where the wrist starts is just a bit longer than the longest finger from the mid-knuckle. So it's quite big, by quite a bit, actually. **But just think of it as bigger, so you don't do too small a thumb. **</p>

<p>So <strong>the thumb is big</strong>. It's not quite twice as thick as the other fingers, but think of it as thicker. You certainly don't want a spindly thumb.</p>

<h3>Drawing the Fingers</h3>

<p>And get that hypothenar eminence in as long, and the thenar eminence, the thumb pad, as thicker and shorter.</p>

<p>Now you saw me put the fingernail in there. It follows that curve back, and that's on the thumb, but on the other fingers it seems to do the opposite. So keep your eye on the thumb. It's a different kind of beast. That's how it is on me anyway. I have to look at more fingers.</p>

<p>So we tend to draw our own hands generally.</p>

<h3>Simplifying the Hand's Structure</h3>

<p>There's the hypo. It's more of a <strong>metronome kind of shape</strong>, if you know what a metronome is, where it counts notes for music, has that shape to it without the tic toc, or a watchtower.</p>

<p>Try and find the mnemonic, you can remember. So I'm doing the 1, 2, 3, thumb, 2, 3, to get the longest finger, and then start coming in. So the fingers are padded underneath, and they're hard on top. And so I think like that when I'm making these strokes.</p>

<p>So I use the broad of the pencil for the underneaths usually, and then point up on top of the pencil for the tops. See that? Nice and thin. That's one-third smaller each time for each phalange.</p>

<p>There's only two phalanges in the thumb, but I treat the metacarpal of the thumb as the third phalange, and then it keeps me on the straight and narrow. I can go 1-2-3 rather than 1-2.</p>

<h3>Understanding Creases and Pads</h3>

<p>The strange thing happens under the hand. Each pad is almost the same distance. They're almost thirds, with the middle third a little bit longer. Now that's different from the top. The reason for that is we're not seeing all the way down to the knuckle. This is because of the pad of the knuckles. So we get a second crease there, which is very, very confusing. It confused the life out of me for so long.</p>

<p><strong>Think it from the knuckle, punching knuckle, down to the halfway, and then I usually do halfway again</strong>, and that's an easy way to think.</p>

<h3>Simplifying the Complicated</h3>

<p>The hands are so tricky. You've got to get some plans in place to draw them with any authority at all. And remember, nobody's taking a measuring tool to it. So <strong>think of simple first</strong>. Glenn Vilppu said it and put me at ease. He said, "People treat hands as hard." Try not to think like that. Make it too complicated. So <strong>as simple as you can</strong>, especially the most complicated thing. Whatever's most complicated, <strong>it needs to be simplified even more</strong>.</p>

<p>You've got to take on so much to make it work.</p>

<h2>The Importance of Mileage</h2>

<p>And let's get back in <strong>more mileage</strong> here. As we go along, we get more and more confident. If you start to lose the fundamentals, like forget about them, then put in some arrows to remind yourself of where the turn of the shoulder is and where the pinch is, all that kind of stuff.</p>

<h3>Drawing with Confidence</h3>

<p>Putting the head up here. Like I say, we're going to push ourselves a little bit more here. So head goes up, and I think of a mask. I think of a Halloween mask. And the strange thing with the head is it's an ovoid shape looking right at us, but as it goes back in perspective, the jaw gets wider and the head in perspective gets more narrow, and they become almost the same.</p>

<p>So you can think of a can with a bit of a swell to it, like a fizzy drink can, and you're getting closer to the truth of it in perspective. So tricky again here.</p>

<h3>Pushing the Shoulders Forward</h3>

<p>Arms behind, and that pushes the shoulders forward, and so we see the top of the shoulders more. So remember, <strong>the shoulders are not two-dimensional</strong>. You can push them forward. Think of them as a little bit like American football player pads. And do it yourself. Hunch your shoulders forward, and you can see in a mirror that you're starting to look more and more at the top of the shoulders. Then pull them back, and you'll see your clavicles lift.</p>

<p>But for now, it's a simple thing, a tube and a curve. So they become more curved as they get hunched.</p>

<h3>Drawing the Legs</h3>

<p>And then fitting those legs in. Just look to Mrs. V. She'll always help you. And then for the leg going underneath, <strong>make sure it's going underneath</strong>. Not attaching paper-thin onto Mrs. V because it's going under there. Remember, the gluteus are coming down below Mrs. V at the back.</p>

<h3>Simplifying the Hand Again</h3>

<p>Now look how easy that hand went in. So we just thought about half and half, and then half. And that's easy. So from a side profile, you can do that very easily because nothing is in perspective. So anything that's to the side horizontally or going up like a pipe straight is not in perspective. They are on the 2D plane, up and down, left and right. And that's an easy way to get your proportions.</p>

<p>That's why the standard figure is easier to measure because everything is on the 2D plane. Nothing's coming at you. That's the reason for it.</p>

<h3>Thinking Dimensionally</h3>

<p>And then you can experiment, like we're doing here, with proportion, things coming forward like the shoulders, and things going back in space like the legs. And on and on we go to <strong>bend our minds a little bit more into the space</strong> of this is all the same as the standing figure, but now you've moved the parts around a little bit. So you've got to think <strong>dimensionally</strong>. You've got to get out of that 2D world if you want to draw convincing dimensional figures.</p>

<p>Of course, you can just do graphic stuff where it's not that, you actually use that 2D idea like the Egyptians did. And it looks great! So everything's up for grabs. But if you've come here to draw characters that are dimensional, this is what we need to do. There are at least some boundaries, we need to adhere to.</p>

<p>Well, quite a lot done actually. And <strong>draw so many drawings to get there</strong>. And you can see how I like the foot in a sock idea. Anyone who's taken my live classes, we do lots of feet and hands. This is more about the big things with a little stop once in a while to get things like the hands in.</p>

<p>But you can see that toe is just a broad mark, and then a further broad turn for the other toes. So the big toe is coming at us, all the other toes are kind of crunching and curling away from us.</p>

<h3>The Foot vs. the Hand</h3>

<p>It's the <strong>dumb cousin of the hand</strong>, the foot. It's not articulate like the hand, but it can definitely flex its toes. It just can't give us any supination. It can't twist around so we see the back of the foot like the hand can. So it's pretty much looking at us all the time from the front and looking away from us all the time at the back, unless you stand on your toes.</p>

<h2>The Importance of the Process</h2>

<p>Alright, so there's a figure, a tricky figure, and I didn't render it. I'd love to, but then you would be getting less bind for your buck really, because I could just take up an hour doing the same thing over and over.</p>

<p>I want to give you <strong>lots of different poses</strong> here so you really truly understand the <strong>power of osmosis</strong>, and then we'll do that render at the end.</p>

<p>We'll do little bits of render here and there, but this is the <strong>really, really important stuff</strong>. Even if you've taken my courses on render already, you've got to come back to this because you will forget it. It'll rust right up.</p>

<p><strong>Drawing is something you have to be very aware of</strong> as something that can stop being so keen in your mind. It needs to be constantly honed if you want to retain these skills and keep them fluid.</p>

<p>But just like if you're always in good shape and then you go out of shape, you can get back in shape quicker than someone that's never been in shape. So you will come back from it.</p>

<p>I mean, I traveled all over the world into the Middle East and stuff and hardly drew anything at all. So it's very hard for me to come back after that, especially immigrating to another country. Drawing was the last thing I was doing, but it all came back.</p>

<p>And here we are, <strong>proof in the pudding</strong>.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p><strong>Remember, it's all about simplifying the complexity, enjoying the process, and putting in the mileage.</strong> Keep drawing, keep pushing yourself, and you'll see the magic happen. Happy drawing!</p>
