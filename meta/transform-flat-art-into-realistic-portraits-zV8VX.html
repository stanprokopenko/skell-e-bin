<h2>Painting Process Overview</h2>

<p>I took a break, got some water, and returned to work on the painting before bed. It was important to me to <strong>complete the painting</strong> before calling it a night. I focused on the <strong>drapery and vest details</strong> because leaving them unfinished was bothersome.</p>

<h2>Color Selection and Adjustment</h2>

<p>I had already established the colors for the scarf and green shirt. However, I needed a darker color for the vest. I decided to use black with a bit of red to warm it up, aiming for a <strong>dark brown</strong>. This process involved some <strong>trial and error</strong> to get the right color. Once the color looked close to what I wanted, I decided to go with it.</p>

<h2>Managing Unfinished Areas</h2>

<p>I considered that the background and vest might blend, which was fine with me. I adjusted the scarf to bring in the vest instead. It's crucial not to leave <strong>sour notes</strong> in a painting, as they could bother you later. Unfinished details could be the reason for disliking a painting years later. Completing these details helps others relate to the painting rather than being puzzled by unfinished areas.</p>

<h2>Adding Details and Character Identity</h2>

<p>I aimed to quickly indicate details to establish the character's identity. In my experience, collectors appreciate a <strong>complete story</strong> rather than an unfinished study. I tend to tell the whole story in my paintings, for better or worse. I questioned whether adding more details made the painting feel more complete. I wasn't doing this to draw attention but to avoid distractions from the main focus.</p>

<h2>Artistic Decisions and Techniques</h2>

<p>I took <strong>artistic license</strong> to suggest the character's head was casting a shadow on a nearby wall. I played with shadows to create lost edges and bring focus to the face. I revisited the original color mixture to maintain balance and avoid excessive deviations. I added surface texture with a <strong>palette knife</strong> for contrast with brushwork. Working over thick paint required adding more texture, enhancing the painting.</p>

<h2>Achieving Realism</h2>

<p>I discussed the principle of achieving a glowing effect through smooth transitions. I reflected on the process from starting with a graphite drawing to adding shadows and light. The initial flat, posterized look was necessary for building realism. I emphasized the importance of <strong>observation and getting proportions right</strong>. I explained the transition from flat to realistic through stages of adding halftones and edges. I used my finger to <strong>soften edges</strong>, which made a significant difference. I added color variations to flesh tones to avoid a plasticky look. I encouraged playing with edges and colors while maintaining control.</p>

<h2>Reflection and Future Plans</h2>

<p>I aimed to simplify the painting process without overwhelming with too many fundamentals. I suggested that following this process could lead to a decent painting, even without advanced drawing skills. I proposed trying the process again with a different model to reinforce learning. I concluded for the night, planning to reassess the painting in the morning and possibly add more.</p>
