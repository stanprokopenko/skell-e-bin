<h2>What's in Premium?</h2>

<p>In the premium lesson, you'll learn how to draw an anvil using three-point perspective from an up view. We'll guide you through:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Setting up a grid</strong> for the up view in three-point perspective.</li>

<li><strong>Establishing vanishing points</strong>, including placing the third vanishing point above to create the illusion of looking up at the object.</li>

<li><strong>Constructing the anvil's basic box</strong> using grid lines and finding key proportions.</li>

<li><strong>Drawing the base</strong> and adding the feet with accurate spacing and proportions.</li>

<li><strong>Shaping the horn</strong> by considering it as a series of ellipses to capture its roundness.</li>

<li><strong>Refining the drawing</strong> to enhance the three-dimensional form.</li>

</ul>
