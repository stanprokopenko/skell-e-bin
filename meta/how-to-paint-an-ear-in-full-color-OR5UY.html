<p>In this lesson, I'll walk you through painting a realistic ear from start to finish. We'll focus on essential techniques to capture the ear's forms, colors, and subtle details.</p>

<h2>Applying the Color Wash</h2>

<p>I like to start with a color wash to establish a warm base. For this ear, I chose a <strong>cadmium red orange</strong> at about 96% opacity. This sets a vibrant foundation, especially useful for capturing subsurface scattering and dark accents.</p>

<h2>Rough Gesture Drawing</h2>

<p>Using a colorized line, I begin a rough gesture drawing on a separate layer. I select a darker, moderately saturated orange or red for the lines. I sketch the back line of the jaw and cheekbone to anchor where the ear attaches. Then, I draw the basic <strong>bass clef shape</strong> of the ear, getting the initial rhythms down before refining.</p>

<h2>Defining Shapes and Structures</h2>

<p>Next, I break down the interior shapes using large hook shapes to describe the inner lines of the helix and smaller hooks for the tragus. I use straight lines to define secondary shapes, adding structure and contrasting with the curves. This balance of <strong>straights against curves</strong> enhances the design.</p>

<h2>Mapping Lights and Darks</h2>

<p>I map out the separation of lights and darks, filling in shadow areas like the concha and beneath the earlobe. This helps establish the ear's three-dimensional form early on.</p>

<h2>Blocking in Local Colors</h2>

<p>On a new layer, I block in flat local colors, starting with the skin tone. I adjust the color to match the mid-tones of the reference, aiming for a balance between ochre and red. I fill in the earrings with a darker gold to stand out against the skin, and block in the hair with a dark brown.</p>

<h2>Adding Midtones and Highlights</h2>

<p>I create another layer to add midtones and highlights. Focusing on the areas catching light, I gradually build up the lighter values, paying attention to the subtle shifts in color and value. I also adjust the color of the lines to blend with the painting.</p>

<h2>Refining with the Blender Brush</h2>

<p>At this stage, I flatten the layers (keeping backups) and use the <strong>blender brush</strong> to soften edges and merge colors seamlessly. This helps transition from the initial graphic shapes to a more painterly look.</p>

<h2>Enhancing Subsurface Scattering</h2>

<p>I emphasize the <strong>subsurface scattering</strong>, particularly where the ear is thin and light shines through, like the helix and lobule. I add warmer, more saturated reds and oranges to these areas to capture that translucent glow.</p>

<h2>Pushing Highlights and Dark Accents</h2>

<p>I intensify the <strong>dark accents</strong> in the deepest shadows and the <strong>highlights</strong> on areas most directly facing the light. This adds depth and realism, making the ear feel more three-dimensional. I experiment with cool colors like cyan for the hottest highlights.</p>

<h2>Final Touches and Details</h2>

<p>I clean up any remaining line work, add subtle textures like peach fuzz, and ensure a balance of <strong>large, medium, and small brushstrokes</strong>. I look for opportunities to place <strong>straights against curves</strong> for a stronger design.</p>

<h2>Recap of Ear Anatomy</h2>

<p>To conclude, here's a quick recap of the ear's anatomy:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Helix</strong>: the outer rim</li>

<li><strong>Antihelix</strong>: the inner curved prominence</li>

<li><strong>Tragus</strong>: the small projection in front of the ear canal</li>

<li><strong>Antitragus</strong>: opposite the tragus, above the earlobe</li>

<li><strong>Concha</strong>: the deep bowl leading to the ear canal</li>

<li><strong>Earlobe</strong>: the lower fleshy part</li>

</ul>

<p>This completes our ear painting. In the next lesson, we'll move on to the lips.</p>
