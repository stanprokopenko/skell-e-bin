<h2>Why Make Value Scales</h2>

<p>Creating value scales teaches you how to control your mediums and develops your patience. If you can't produce exact values in a simple scale, you can't expect to handle complex portrait drawings. It's beneficial to make a value scale for <strong>every medium</strong> you want to master, whether it's pencils, markers, ink, or charcoal.</p>

<h2>Level 1: Basic Value Scale</h2>

<p>Start by drawing a 1x1 inch rectangle divided into <strong>11 squares</strong>. Feel free to use a ruler, and draw the lines <strong>very lightly</strong> to avoid dark lines between squares, which can hinder value comparison.</p>

<ol>

<li><strong>Establish Your Darkest Value</strong>: Find the darkest value your pencils can produce. This is your value zero.</li>

<li><strong>Define Your Lightest Value</strong>: The white of the paper serves as your lightest value.</li>

<li><strong>Fill in the Middle Values</strong>: Gradually fill in the squares between the darkest and lightest values. You can work sequentially or start in the middle and adjust as needed.</li>

</ol>

<p>Using a range of pencils like <strong>2H, HB, 2B, 4B, and 6B</strong> makes this task easier, as each pencil has a comfortable range. If you're using fewer pencils, you'll need better control to achieve the full range of values.</p>

<h3>Tips:</h3>

<ul>

<li><strong>Err on the Side of Being Too Light</strong>: It's easier to darken values than to lighten them.</li>

<li><strong>Use a Kneaded Eraser</strong>: If you need to lighten an area, blotting with a kneaded eraser can help.</li>

<li><strong>Aim for Clean Shading</strong>: Avoid holes and inconsistent patches. Revisit and adjust squares to ensure a consistent progression without blending tools.</li>

<li><strong>Squint at Your Work</strong>: This helps you blur the values together and see where jumps are too extreme or values are too similar.</li>

</ul>

<p>If you want an easier start, create a scale with <strong>five squares</strong>. Begin with the extremes, then fill in the middle and the values between.</p>

<h2>Level 2: Blind Value Scales</h2>

<p>Challenge yourself by making a <strong>blind value scale</strong>. For this exercise:</p>

<ol>

<li><strong>Prepare Separate Squares</strong>: Cut out individual 1 or 2-inch squares. Number each one on the back.</li>

<li><strong>Shade Each Square Independently</strong>: Do each value without seeing the others. You can do them in a specific order or randomly for added difficulty.</li>

<li><strong>Line Them Up</strong>: Once finished, arrange them in order to see how smooth the gradation is.</li>

</ol>

<p>Adjust the difficulty by changing the number of squares. Doing five squares blind is much easier than doing eleven.</p>

<h2>Optional: Marker Value Scales</h2>

<p>If you're working with markers, try creating a value scale to practice even application:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Use Multiple Markers</strong>: Combine markers of different shades (e.g., cool gray 1, 3, 5, 7, and black) to create a range of values.</li>

<li><strong>Practice Consistent Strokes</strong>: Overlapping inconsistently can create striations. Apply strokes evenly to achieve smooth values.</li>

<li><strong>Layer for In-Between Values</strong>: Apply the same marker multiple times or combine markers to create intermediate values.</li>

<li><strong>Be Patient with Drying</strong>: Wait a few minutes for the markers to dry to see the true value, as wet pigment appears darker.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Final Advice</h2>

<p>Approach these exercises with patience and <strong>take pride in your work</strong>. Practicing clean and accurate values pays dividends in your drawing skills. As you progress, remember that <strong>how you light your work affects the values in your photos</strong>, so learn to take evenly lit, high-quality images of your drawings.</p>
