<h2>What's in Premium?</h2>

<p>In the premium lesson, you'll learn the "yearbook principle" for capturing the essence of a subject in art, particularly in portrait drawing. This principle emphasizes focusing on overall shapes and silhouettes rather than intricate details. Techniques like squinting are taught to help simplify and concentrate on essential shapes and contrasts. The lesson also covers the importance of accurately placing light and shadow to achieve a likeness, and how refining the drawing enhances the artwork. </p>
