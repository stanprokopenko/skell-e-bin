<p>Welcome! In this session, you're going to learn how to evaluate your own shaded spheres, identify common mistakes, and improve your understanding of light, shadow, and form. Below, you'll find a straightforward breakdown of the most frequent issues, how to fix them, and what successful shading looks like. This guide distills feedback from student submissions done under different time limits, including unlimited, 25, 10, and 5 minutes, so you get advice that applies no matter how fast you're working.</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>You’ll be critiquing your spheres for <strong>value organization</strong>, which is how you separate lights and shadows while shading. There are a handful of major mistakes that come up repeatedly. Instead of repeating feedback for each one, you’ll find efficient, grouped advice here.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p><strong>Common Mistake 1: Incorrect Placement of the Terminator</strong></p>

<p>The <strong>terminator</strong> is the edge where the form transitions from light into shadow. Most people are placing the terminator too far onto the light side. For a sphere lit by a distant light, the terminator runs right through the equator. If you put it too far over, it cuts just a small cap off the side, which only happens when the light source is very close.</p>

<ul>

<li>When the light is far away (like a lamp five feet from a two-inch ball), the incoming rays are nearly parallel. That puts the terminator, a circular ellipse, along the sphere’s equator.</li>

<li>If your ellipse is off-center, you’re suggesting that the light source is much closer. That’s not the case with the reference used here.</li>

<li>Avoid making shapes that look like slices off the sphere’s top or sides. Instead, look for that equator and draw your terminator ellipse right through the middle.</li>

<li>The <strong>core shadow</strong> sits entirely on the shadow side of this ellipse, so don’t overlap them.</li>

<li>If the form is an egg or an elongated sphere, this principle still applies: find the middle.</li>

<li>This logic is foundational for things like the Loomis head, once you can slice up and shade spheres correctly, you can start applying these ideas to more complex forms.</li>

</ul>

<p><strong>Key points:</strong></p>

<ul>

<li>The <strong>terminator = equator</strong> for distant light sources.</li>

<li>Core shadow belongs fully to the shadow side, not straddling the terminator.</li>

<li>Don’t accidentally imply a close-up light if it’s actually far away.</li>

</ul>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p><strong>Common Mistake 2: Reflected Light Value Issues</strong></p>

<p>A common problem is that <strong>reflected light</strong> on the shadow side is drawn too light, sometimes as light as the halftones on the lit side.</p>

<ul>

<li>This flattens out the effect of form, or in some cases, suggests an impossible material (like an object that is both matte and metallic at the same time).</li>

<li>If the reflected light matches or exceeds the halftone value, it’s wrong unless you’re intentionally depicting a very shiny surface, in which case the core shadow would nearly disappear.</li>

<li>You want a clear separation between core shadow, reflected light, and halftones. Don’t let values on the shadow side creep up so far they mix with the light side.</li>

<li>Review templates for value ranges: the cast shadow should be darkest, then the core shadow, then reflected light, then halftones, then highlights.</li>

</ul>

<p><strong>Key points:</strong></p>

<ul>

<li>Keep reflected light notably darker than halftones.</li>

<li>Maintain value hierarchy: core shadow and cast shadow are darkest.</li>

</ul>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p><strong>Common Mistake 3: Problems with Halftone Gradation</strong></p>

<p><strong>Too Linear Gradation</strong></p>

<ul>

<li>Many spheres have a gradation from shadow to light that’s too even and stretched out.</li>

<li>This ignores the <strong>Lambert’s cosine law</strong>: the rate of transition from shadow into light should happen quickly, mostly right at the edge of the core shadow.</li>

<li>If you drag the gradient out too slowly, the form looks flat or ambiguous.</li>

</ul>

<p><strong>Too Abrupt Transition</strong></p>

<ul>

<li>If your transition from shadow to light happens in a hard jump (just a thin line between dark and light), you get a “boxy” feel, as though you’re drawing planes, not a curved form.</li>

<li>The result is a visual sharp edge where there should be a round turning.</li>

</ul>

<p>The right approach is a balance, a transition that’s quick near the core shadow but not instantaneous.</p>

<p><strong>What to do:</strong></p>

<ul>

<li>Push most of the shift into light much closer to the core shadow.</li>

<li>Avoid dragging the dark values too far towards the center light.</li>

<li>Don’t swing to the other extreme and make all your transitions so sharp that the form loses its roundness.</li>

</ul>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p><strong>Common Mistake 4: Incorrect Cast Shadow Shape</strong></p>

<ul>

<li>The cast shadows from spheres are often not perfect ellipses, they get drawn as teardrops, pills, candy-corn shapes, or have mismatched ends.</li>

<li>For a sphere sitting on a flat surface, the cast shadow should always be a clean ellipse.</li>

<li>If you see one end thick, the other end skinny, or shapes that can’t be completed as a simple ellipse, adjust your approach.</li>

<li>On a curved surface (like an arm, leg, or banana), the cast shadow will wrap around, so the shape can vary there, but flat surfaces demand a basic ellipse.</li>

</ul>

<p><strong>What to check:</strong></p>

<ul>

<li>Both ends of the cast shadow ellipse should align and connect naturally.</li>

<li>Avoid straight-sided or lumpy shapes. Don’t let one end bulge or point unnaturally.</li>

<li>Only use artistic license where the shadow falls on a non-flat surface.</li>

</ul>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p><strong>Common Mistake 5: Spotty or Dirty Halftones</strong></p>

<ul>

<li>Random patches of light and dark in the wrong places disrupt form and make the sphere look “dirty” or stepped.</li>

<li>Darker marks near the highlight or lighter patches near the shadow destroy the sense of smoothness.</li>

<li>Some surface noise is natural, but it must “average out” into the correct value in the correct zone.</li>

<li>Problems arise when sloppy transitions start to create visible stripes, steps, or dirt-like marks.</li>

<li>Too much dark near the highlight or inconsistent patches make the form read incorrectly.</li>

</ul>

<p><strong>What to correct:</strong></p>

<ul>

<li>Major value zones (highlight, halftone, core shadow, reflected light, cast shadow) must be in the right spots.</li>

<li>Don’t accept big blotches or patches of value that aren’t justified by the shape’s geometry.</li>

<li>Value noise is only OK if the overall transitions and zones remain correct.</li>

</ul>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p><strong>What Good Examples Look Like</strong></p>

<ul>

<li>Clean transitions: smooth changes from light to shadow, with most of the transition happening close to the core shadow.</li>

<li>Correct value separation: shadow, reflected light, and halftones are clearly distinct.</li>

<li>Good cast shadow ellipses: both ends naturally connect, no odd bulges or points.</li>

<li>Confident, energetic marks: even if your drawing is rough or you’re using pen and ink in a fast sketch, if the transitions and value zones are in the proper places, the sphere will still look solid and three-dimensional.</li>

<li>In time-limited attempts, a little messiness is forgivable as long as your fundamentals are intact.</li>

</ul>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p><strong>General Advice for Practice</strong></p>

<ul>

<li>After completing a drawing, look for these five major mistakes in your own work.</li>

<li>Deliberate practice means isolating your problem, making corrections, and repeating until it becomes second nature.</li>

<li>Shading well is a science, you’re learning to represent light physics with your marks. With time, patterns become obvious, and your brain shifts from “what value do I use?” to focusing on creativity, form design, and storytelling.</li>

<li>Keep reviewing specific zones, transitions, and values until you can shade almost automatically.</li>

</ul>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>You’re making strong progress, most students share the same handful of issues, and once you’re aware of them, you can systematically fix your approach. Keep practicing shading spheres, paying close attention to these problem areas. You’ll develop both the eye and the technique for three-dimensional form.</p>

<p>Stay at it, keep drawing, and let’s get even better at shading!</p>
