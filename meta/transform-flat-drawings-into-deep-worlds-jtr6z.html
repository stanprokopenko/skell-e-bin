<p>In this course, we teach how to create depth on a flat surface using perspective. Perspective isn't just for boxes, buildings, and streets; it applies to everything. A box can represent many forms, including cylindrical shapes, and spheres are fundamental forms in the world.</p>

<h2>Importance of Perspective</h2>

<p><strong>Perspective</strong> is crucial for representing various forms, including cylindrical shapes and spheres. It's essential for drawing imagined scenes and objects from any viewpoint. Without perspective, your drawings can look flat and unrealistic.</p>

<h2>Challenges in Learning Perspective</h2>

<p>Few artists master perspective. Historically, it was hard to learn due to a lack of resources. I personally struggled to learn perspective for professional illustration. It's a common challenge, but overcoming it is rewarding.</p>

<h2>Benefits of Learning Perspective</h2>

<p>Learning perspective helps create <strong>believable scenes</strong>. It enables you to draw from imagination, making your art more dynamic and original. I've seen former students use perspective to draw from imagination successfully. Perspective allows you to create scenes where elements like trees or footprints shrink convincingly.</p>

<h2>Course Structure and Assignments</h2>

<p>Our course includes a range of assignments, from light to heavy, all aimed at developing inventive skills. Perspective problems are like puzzles; solving them can be fun. </p>

<p><strong>First Project:</strong> Collect your favorite drawings by perspective masters and identify perspective problems. Ask yourself questions like, "How do arches get smaller?" and "How do I draw from different viewpoints?"</p>

<h2>Historical Context of Perspective</h2>

<p>Perspective has a rich history, with 600 years of Renaissance knowledge behind it. While we use modern tools, we teach the old drawing skills that have stood the test of time.</p>

<h2>Practical Applications of Perspective</h2>

<p>Perspective is practical for drawing elements like shrinking trees or footprints. It helps you explore questions such as how arches get smaller and how to draw from different viewpoints. This course is designed for both beginners and professionals, with the goal of using perspective knowledge for a lifetime.</p>
