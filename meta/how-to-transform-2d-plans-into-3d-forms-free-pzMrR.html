<h2>What's in Premium?</h2>

<p>In this lesson, you'll learn to create spatial puzzles from a single plan that shows only width and depth. You'll explore how to assign heights creatively, transforming positive parts into negatives, adjusting elevations, and connecting floating sections. Using provided templates and height lines, you'll draw precise oblique and orthographic views to enhance your spatial understanding. The lesson also covers techniques like simplifying with isometric graph paper and designing your own forms based on the plan. This practice will sharpen your spatial reasoning and drawing skills.</p>
