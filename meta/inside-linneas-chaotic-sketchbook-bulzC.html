<h2>My Sketchbook and Inspirations</h2>

<p>I love my sketchbook, it's chaotic and filled to the brim with stickers. Opening it, I'm instantly met with positive vibes from stickers made by friends, images of my cats, Moomin, Kaiba, <strong>all things I love and enjoy</strong>. It inspires me to create every time I flip it open.</p>

<p>I use a Moleskine sketchbook. Though they're pricey, I don't sketch every day, so it was worth investing in quality paper. The first page is always the hardest to break into due to the pressure for it to look perfect. I'm glad once that's over and I can dive into drawing.</p>

<h2>Sketching Process and Style</h2>

<p>I adore drawing women and girls, <strong>flowing lines</strong> and <strong>thick line weights</strong> dominate my sketches. You'll notice recurring themes, cute girls, snakes, bones, and outfits I wish existed or that I'm too shy to wear. I love exaggerating anatomy, particularly <strong>girthy forearms</strong> and "marshmallow bodies" inspired by the anime Kaiba.</p>

<p>Since I'm not much of a sketcher, my sketchbook is mostly for warm-ups or quick visualizations. Sometimes, I'll create outlines to color digitally in Procreate, which is easier than dealing with traditional mediums.</p>

<h3>Experimentation and Themes</h3>

<p>Occasionally, I challenge myself by drawing non-human subjects, like centaurs or animals. I drew rats as an ode to my pets growing up, I wish I were better at drawing rodents! I'm fascinated by death and the process of decay, so I often balance dark and gory elements with an ethereal, cutesy vibe.</p>

<p>I enjoy drawing without a plan, letting the image unfold naturally. It's like a conversation between me and the paper. Sometimes, I write important notes, but later I can't decipher them. It's interesting how my emotional state affects my lines, <strong>hesitation shows when I'm stressed or forcing myself to draw</strong>.</p>

<h2>Overcoming Art Block</h2>

<p>When I'm art-blocked, I remind myself that <strong>sometimes it's okay not to challenge yourself</strong>. I return to the simplest essence of what I know, drawing super quick and easy things to rebuild my mojo. Starting is the hardest part, but once I get into the process, I become absorbed in it.</p>

<h2>Embracing Mistakes and Sharing</h2>

<p>I used to be self-conscious about my sketchbook's imperfections. But sketchbooks are visual diaries for artists, not everything needs to be polished. Letting go of that shame and allowing others into my thought process has been liberating. <strong>Don't feel bad if your sketchbook isn't super refined</strong>.</p>

<h2>Favorite and Least Favorite Parts of Drawing</h2>

<p>I hate starting to draw, the blank page is daunting. Once I get going, I enjoy the process until I lay down the base colors. These often look bad at first. But as I add details and see the illustration come together, the joy returns. It's a rollercoaster, but it's worth it.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p>At the end of the day, we're never truly bored, we can always pick up a pencil and <strong>sketch away</strong>. Embrace the chaos and creativity that comes with being an artist. Your sketchbook doesn't have to be perfect, it's a space for exploration and growth.</p>
