<h2>Setting Up the Grid</h2>

<p>We are going to make the anvil float in space. Notice that the grid is an <strong>up view</strong>, lines going away to the <strong>vanishing point on the right</strong> are going down, and lines to the <strong>vanishing point on the left</strong> are going down as well. There is <strong>no vanishing point for the vertical lines</strong>, it is in <strong>two-point perspective</strong>.</p>

<p>In fact, this is the same grid that I used for the down view, but turned upside down. Since these vertical lines are vertical, we can play with the position of the <strong>third vanishing point</strong> to redraw this and make it so that the lines going away are going slightly up.</p>

<p>I placed the third vanishing point <strong>where I could on the coffee table</strong>, allowing me the space to fit a third vanishing point way up there. This works to put it in <strong>mild three-point perspective</strong>.</p>

<h2>Building the Box</h2>

<p>Let's begin. Here's our mild up view in three-point perspective on a vellum overlay. We'll build a box, making a corner there. Going up to the <strong>vanishing point</strong> should be easy, it is right there on a grid line. Going down to the <strong>right vanishing point</strong> is also simple, it's on a grid line. Going back to the <strong>vanishing point on the left</strong> is a little less easy but manageable, it is a compromise between two grid lines.</p>

<h3>Establishing Proportions</h3>

<p>We must decide the proportions of this front face, as we have so often. I'll put it about here and then run it back to the grid line. I'll take it out this far for the front. Now I've got to decide how far back, and I'll decide right about here.</p>

<p>We can test to see whether my lines were well-chosen. When we throw back these corners on the grid, which helps keep it more accurate than if I were doing it freehand, that back plane should not get so open that it isn't credible as a rectangle of the proportion I seek. It's pretty doggone open, but let's give it a try. I think it's credible. I will accept it in spite of its lack of perfection.</p>

<p>We need one more line from this corner to this corner. Even though it doesn't hit it absolutely exactly, it's good enough. That's the box I'm seeking, with this rectangle on the right more closed, and the one on the left more open, to represent the rectangle of the whole box in which this anvil fits.</p>

<h3>Finding the Center</h3>

<p>We also want to find the <strong>center of this side plane</strong>, because that will tell us exactly the halfway point from front to back and from top to bottom. When I carry it all the way around, it will create a section that has a name. I wonder whether you've been doing your homework and you can name what section that is, the <strong>center coronal section</strong>. It is a rectangle, just like the front and the back.</p>

<h2>Constructing the Waist and Base</h2>

<p>I tried doing this by building the base. We're going to make it so that it's facing up like that, we are looking at the base. I tried building the base and then working up from there, but there were so many lines, it just turned into craziness. So I think I've got a better way to go about it.</p>

<h3>Establishing the Waist</h3>

<p>This waist, that center, is it a center? See if you can say it before I do, <strong>transverse section</strong>, horizontal section. It is this deep and this wide, which means somewhere in there we're going to find a <strong>square</strong>. If that is the half point from front to back, that square is going to be mainly behind that halfway point, and a little bit of it comes forward.</p>

<p>Now, what I'm going to do next can take some serious concentration. I'm going to try to find that center point, or something that will help me, like this center point, and then build that square.</p>

<h3>Placing the Square</h3>

<p>How high? About halfway up. It's actually just a little above halfway up. Let's find the center of the coronal section as rapidly as possible with an X, and I'm going to say that is the very center of the box. Now, a little higher than that, that was the height on the ortho, and a little in front of that, going forward on Z, will give me this front line that will go straight through on X.</p>

<p>How wide will I make it? Don't know yet. But what do we know? We know that it goes down away from us to the right vanishing point, and we've got a grid that we can see through here to keep us in the right direction.</p>

<p>That is going to be the front of the square of the transverse section that I'm seeking. How far will it go? We can see on here that it's about half of the distance. So we'll figure that if this line from there to there was divided into fourths, it would be about from there to there.</p>

<p>Ah, that's the front line of the transverse section, which is near the center of this block. Now we know that that will run back. How far? We'll figure that out. The only thing we know is that the width has been established, we did that on the X line. Now we have to establish the depth on the Z line.</p>

<h3>Estimating Squares in Perspective</h3>

<p>When you get to know squares in perspective, you can estimate it pretty well. I am going to do something I encourage you to do, even if you don't do it well the first few times, or the first many times. I'm going to say that looks like a square in perspective to me.</p>

<p>How do you know exactly? You'll learn that in the next lesson, and as this course goes on, you'll learn not to rely on measuring exactly, because if you just draw squares over and over, you'll start to see them. I think that's good. It's placed a little above and a little forward, and it looks square.</p>

<h3>Finding the Hanging End</h3>

<p>Let's see what else we need to do. We've got to find that <strong>hanging end</strong>, because it's clearly there. The first thing I think we'll do is find the width of it. We've got to locate a center, very, very light lines so that they don't confuse us later. Run that center up to find the center on that line. That will be the center of the back plane, left to right, divided into fourths. I'm going to say there's a fourth, there's a fourth, there's a fourth.</p>

<p>I think that the top back edge of the hanging end is there, and I will be able to see the height of it. But I don't want to make it too tall, because it is less tall than the feet. And the feet we're going to save.</p>

<h3>Adjusting Proportions</h3>

<p>Actually, no, I'm going to put one line in here for the feet. If I put one line in there for the feet, it's going to be confusing unless we know what they are. But let's do this. Let's take the face, which is up there on the other side where we can't see it. Let's run a line forward on Z. It's just a straight line on Z, but we know that it's coming from the right place because it's there where that edge would be.</p>

<p>And then where does it stop? It stops, I'll call it one unit in front of the halfway point. Where is the halfway point on the top? It's there and there. So if I bring it forward that much, that looks right to me. It eyeballs well. So let's darken it. And then this underhang, the throat, comes forward the same amount, which means one vertical line going up and away to vanishing point number three.</p>

<h2>Constructing the Base and Feet</h2>

<p>Well, this is starting to look hopeful. We know that the top will go straight down because we're looking up. Where will it stop? I think if we use this other side and run it out there, and then connect some dots. When things are purely left and right, up and down, front and back, it is so easy.</p>

<p>But what can be confusing here is that much of what I've drawn will disappear as we go. It will be covered up by other lines. I'm going to dab it back so that it doesn't take on too much authority.</p>

<h3>Establishing the Feet</h3>

<p>We've also got to step down slightly in. That's where we're going to take the drop that turns into a step, and it will come forward another less than a unit, and it will come forward directly like that on that line, and down like that.</p>

<p>Let's, so that we don't get too confused, dab some of the lines will disappear. We'll deal with that later. That will be a complicated area.</p>

<p>Let's do this: let's take that back hanging end and run a straight line to the waist. We'll make it a curved line later.</p>

<h3>Adding the Front and Back Feet</h3>

<p>Now, how about the base? I think it's okay to do the base because we're in this area. This whole rectangle is less foreshortened than some of the other views, like the eye-level view we did.</p>

<p>So we're taking this rectangle, and we can look at the halfway point. The <strong>front foot</strong> is in front of the halfway point, and then more than a unit forward, and then the same size foot back there with definitely more space there.</p>

<p>So the first thing we'll do is find the halfway point. That way, we know that is the halfway point and those feet touch the side of the box. I'm going to put the front foot, these don't get nearly as compressed as a previous view.</p>

<p>Higher front foot than the height of that hanging end, and I will guess that the foot in perspective will go at about that proportion. I don't feel bad about it, that's got to count for something.</p>

<p>How about the back foot? Well, the back foot, this distance and the distance behind the back foot, this distance is less than the distance behind the back foot, but it is also far back there. So it could be smaller but not that much smaller because, as I said, this is a pretty unforeshortened plane.</p>

<h3>Checking Placement</h3>

<p>But here's what I want to check before making my final decision. If I put a back foot there, I need some space between the front and back foot, and I see that another unit and another unit and a smaller unit should make that difference.</p>

<p>So if I could say about like that, about, oh, I think we should bring it forward a bit. I think I've spread the feet out too far. I'm going to be safer with that, maybe even that way.</p>

<p>Now, how will we test the placement of those? One way is to run a line on this convenient grid line and another line over here on this less convenient but helpful set of grid lines. If that's the corner analogous to that one, and that's the corner analogous to that one, and I fill in this whole diamond, that rectangle should be deeper than it is wide.</p>

<p>And it looks that way, you see, deeper than it is wide. We've got that. The other feet, which we didn't have to deal with in other views, will be visible here.</p>

<h3>Adding the Side Feet</h3>

<p>So the other foot on the other side and the other foot on the other side, just ever so slightly in front of that halfway line. Then we know that those points are safely placed in a position where we won't have to regret that we placed them there.</p>

<p>Trying to compensate for my inaccurate lines by doing them over and over is kind of a drafting stammer.</p>

<h2>Constructing the Curves</h2>

<p>How about the way these feet go in to the width of the body? Also, they go up. That's a complex plane, let's work on it.</p>

<h3>Connecting Corners</h3>

<p>Straight lines can help us get to understand it. We want from corner to corner here, and corner to corner, let's see if we can do this freehand. That's going to be the center of the bottom, and we've decided that it will go back about a fourth and another fourth, and that is where the curve is going to land.</p>

<p>I'm going to do it that way, even though there is another complexity that can come in here. This body goes down, it goes down again, and it goes out a little. So I think I may, no, I'm going to leave it where it is for simplicity's sake, otherwise we'll get too many lines.</p>

<p>Notice that it does not come to a point, it goes to an area there on the Z line. So let's take that center of this form of this plane, spread it out, spread it out, and then with straight lines, because straight lines are easier to understand, connect that corner and that one, and this corner and this one.</p>

<h3>Forming the Curve</h3>

<p>Look at how that puts us into foreshortened lines that we would never have guessed if we didn't have objective dots to force us into it. It's looking correct, it's not done. This goes up. How far does it go up? We'll know in a minute. It goes up over here too, and it goes up on the grid. So we might see a little of it.</p>

<p>How would we know? I'd go from this corner, and make a parallel line to that. When you say parallel lines, is it going off to a vanishing point? Not actually, hardly at all. I think we're safe enough to make it purely parallel with this one, then parallel with the Z lines, and then straight behind. It's right behind there, you can't see it at all.</p>

<p>And then to curve this, and it has a personality to the curve. It's not a perfect circle, so it's not a perfect ellipse, but look at how it aims there and aims there, and then it curves and pretty much straightens out and curves. So I think if we just average out this straight line to make it so that by the time it gets there, it's curved. By the time it gets to its destination, it's curved.</p>

<p>Let's emphasize that and carry it all the way through. Soften that plane break in there. Same thing will happen over here, it'll be like that.</p>

<h3>Drawing Complex Planes</h3>

<p>Here comes a difficult one, from this point to this corner, we'll start with a straight line. From this point to this corner, we'll use a straight line. From this point to this corner, first line straight. Is it a straight line? It is not.</p>

<p>How does it curve? So I look at it here, it curves by going very much down and then suddenly out. So let's see if we can take this corner, make it go very much down, and then suddenly out. This is definitely not swinging it in gesturally from the shoulder. This is plotting something deliberate.</p>

<p>Now, this will do the same thing, but we're not going to see it as dramatically. It's going to go down and then suddenly out, and this is going to go down, and then wherever that change starts to take, I can travel on X and find it over there. And I think we've got a plane foreshortened that makes enough sense.</p>

<h3>Adding the Underhang</h3>

<p>Oh, here's another one. The hanging end goes definitely forward and then meets this to go down. It's a compromise. I can even say that it's about a 35-degree angle or so as it goes down, although it's in perspective. I'm trying to aim it from here to here. Straight lines told us that. I'm trying to aim it so that when it reaches that point, it's aiming down.</p>

<p>And so I'll feel comfortable enough with a curve like that. That was the straight line that let us find it.</p>

<h3>Defining Planes</h3>

<p>What else have we got? We've got a width line at the base of that hanging end. How far in will it go? I can find out by going over to the other side, running a line down, and saying that is the back left corner. And it will reach over to there. So I can do the same thing I did before, make a straight line over to that analogous corner and then echo this line. That'll do it.</p>

<p>And to make it so that it's clear, I'll erase some of the lines on the other side and maybe put a cross-contour line or two that are X lines to help make no doubt about that plane.</p>

<h2>Constructing the Horn</h2>

<p>Notice that some of these planes, like this underhang and what happened with these curves, would be very difficult to guess. But that's where we're headed, to look at these and understand enough about them to swing them in with X, Y, and Z lines, and with ellipses.</p>

<p>Even this curve, we might have looked at it as an ellipse whose axis was going in that direction. Even though it's not perfectly circular, it would have gotten us started. We could have looked at this center section that's a square as an ellipse, and that would have helped us have something three-dimensional to grip.</p>

<h3>Placing the Horn</h3>

<p>We're going to do it now on this <strong>horn</strong>, which will go to the center top of the box. We know that from the ortho, we find the center point. We go up there, we'll say that's what the end of the horn will touch. And we know that the horn does not start from the top of the face, it starts down below and then it goes up to the top tip of the box.</p>

<p>So we've got to get this point down to something like halfway through. Here's what we've got to do. We've got to extend that step, and even though it will create confusing extra lines, if we don't do it, we'll be grasping at air.</p>

<p>So we're going to run it like that. Find the center, and then the center. Look what we did: I found the center up there on the top of the face, went down, went forward. That's going to be the center of that down step. And that is where the curve of this horn will begin.</p>

<h3>Drawing the Horn</h3>

<p>And it's going to go, as we can see on the ortho, very straightforward, and then it goes up at the final part of its journey. It's going down to a vanishing point, going up as it goes away on the grid line as much as we can do it until it says, "It is time for me to arise," and then it goes up like that. That is a <strong>center line</strong>, it is not a contour line. You'll see what I mean in a moment.</p>

<p>We see that the widest part of this, told you I was going to use an ellipse, let me put another piece of paper over this to give you an idea of what I'm getting at. I'm trying to see the roundness of this horn as an <strong>ellipse</strong>, in a position like that. Don't worry if you don't know how to do that yet, but look at how that gives me a kind of collar, out of which I can lift the form.</p>

<p>So I'm scribing onto here very lightly, trying not to be committed to it or make it too confusing. I'm trying to find very lightly how to get one as wide as this whole body onto this front plane and make it curved so that it's something like this shape, which is not circular, it's fatter left to right.</p>

<p>So I think a shape that I'm taking the pains to draw through, fearful, that is how wide it goes. That's the widest point. Run out here on Z, that's the widest point. And then run that point back and say that will be the widest point over there. And then try to keep this symmetrical on the front plane.</p>

<h3>Defining Contours</h3>

<p>Well, it got us into something that is much more complicated than anything I've taught you so far. If it makes you feel any comfort, we'll deal with it later in future lessons. And we aren't going to see this anyway.</p>

<p>Here's what I meant when I said that line is not a contour, it is a center line. What would be a contour? Well, I'll see if you can figure it out before I draw it.</p>

<p>If this base, this collar out of which the round horn is emerging, is round there, doesn't it make sense that as this thins up, it is going to meet it out there at the point? That is a contour line, I mean an outline.</p>

<h3>Shaping the Horn</h3>

<p>How about below? Well, I want to look at the curve on the ortho. We're always checking, that's almost a regular curve. It almost looks like a portion of a circle. Let's take a center line there, down there, curve it clearly, and then more suddenly. And this top center line will disappear because it is on the other side. This bottom center line will not disappear, it will be visible because the contour of the whole horn is now over there. And as it goes up, it melts with the center line.</p>

<p>So the lines I want to get rid of now are the ones we only used to make it so that this felt like it was emerging credibly from that shoulder. And then the next thing I would do would be to place a <strong>cross-contour</strong>. That's going to echo that. It's going to tell me, let me again, let me show you what I'm doing.</p>

<p>I'm thinking that if the axis is this way, for those of you who will learn ellipses later, some of you already know them, I'm trying to make that curve echo this curve, which is not an ellipse because it's not a perfect circle.</p>

<p>And watch what happens. Look at how it goes almost as if it's a straight line aiming down at the vanishing point. When it comes down here and echoes that, it almost aims down like a straight line to the right vanishing point, and the center line will be there.</p>

<h3>Refining the Drawing</h3>

<p>Okay, let's do another. And I think we'll make it more round as it gets to the end. I think that by the time it gets here, we'll start to make it more like a true ellipse. I'm not sure enough about, I've never worked with an anvil. I've been reading about them. And if you work with anvils and you can say</p>

<p>And then this one we'll make as close to an ellipse as possible. I'm guessing at the eccentricity, the openness of it. But I think that we now have something that reads for all the planes that it needs to. We can scribe an occasional line on there that conforms to the grid to tell us a little more.</p>

<p>Oh look, that can become, instead of a center line, that can become a sideline now. And I think we've got it.</p>

<h2>Finalizing the Drawing</h2>

<p>I'm going to clean this up. As messy as it was with all of this futzing around for trying to find things, you do see that on a grid where we're looking up and lines are going down, every left and right line as it goes away will go down. Every front and back line, as it goes away, will go down. And in the mild three-point perspective, we had a grid, we didn't really need it in here, but we had it to remind ourselves that if something's going up, it is going away to a vanishing point.</p>

<p>That way, I hope this was of some use. Now let's clean it up so that we can put it into presentation mode.</p>
