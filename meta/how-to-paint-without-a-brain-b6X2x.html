<p>Welcome to the course, <strong>Painting Without a Brain</strong>, led by Morgan Weiss Lane. This course is designed to take you on a journey of learning to paint by focusing on objective observation rather than relying on preconceived notions or symbols. Morgan shares her personal journey and teaching philosophy, which began with teaching her young daughter to draw by observing shapes and forms without using her brain.</p>

<h2>Teaching Objective Observation</h2>

<p>The key to this course is learning to draw without preconceived symbols. Morgan emphasizes the importance of observing shapes, both negative and positive spaces, to truly capture what you see. Techniques such as using plumb lines, horizontals, and measurements are introduced to help you observe like a robot, focusing purely on what is in front of you.</p>

<h2>Overcoming Preconceived Knowledge</h2>

<p>In art school, Morgan faced the challenge of unlearning many preconceived ideas about drawing. This course aims to help you avoid that by teaching you to observe objectively from the start. Beginners have an advantage here, as they can approach this method without the baggage of prior knowledge, making it easier to learn and apply.</p>

<h2>Simplifying the Learning Process</h2>

<p>Morgan avoids complex, advanced techniques to keep the learning process simple. Understanding the 'why' and 'how' of painting is crucial, rather than just watching someone paint. It's like watching a magic show, while entertaining, it doesn't teach you how the trick is done. This course is designed to do you good by focusing on the fundamentals.</p>

<h2>Methodical Learning Stages</h2>

<p>The learning process is broken down into stages, making it easier to follow and understand. Each stage is manageable, building your confidence as you progress. By linking these stages together, you'll find that painting isn't as hard as it seems. It's about methodically learning each part and seeing how they connect.</p>

<p>The course emphasizes simplicity and objective observation, encouraging you to follow this method to become a better artist. As a beginner, you have the opportunity to learn without preconceived notions, making this journey more effective. In the next stage, Morgan will discuss the materials needed, so stay tuned and enjoy the ride.</p>
