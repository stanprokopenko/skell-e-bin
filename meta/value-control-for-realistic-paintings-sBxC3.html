<h2>Understanding Values in Painting</h2>

<p><strong>Values</strong> refer to the <strong>lightness and darkness of a color</strong>. They are crucial for creating effective paintings. Using values correctly can enhance your artwork, while incorrect use can ruin it. Mastering values is essential for any painter.</p>

<h2>Simplifying Values with a Six-Value Chart</h2>

<p>To simplify rendering and forming a head in painting, use a <strong>six-value chart</strong>. This chart includes:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Three values in the light family</strong></li>

<li><strong>Three values in the shadow family</strong></li>

</ul>

<p>Simplifying values helps manage the complexity of painting what you see in nature. It prevents the painting process from becoming overwhelming due to the limitations of paint.</p>

<h2>The Concept of Value Families</h2>

<p>The concept of <strong>"families" in values</strong> helps maintain consistency. Keeping value families separate is crucial, much like keeping them close like a family. This prevents any value from standing out too much. Use black and white for simplicity and clarity when discussing values.</p>

<h2>Applying Values in Portrait Painting</h2>

<p>In portrait painting, focus on the <strong>local flesh color</strong> to determine the range of values. Each item in a painting has its own range, but here, the focus is on skin color. Keep light and shadow families apart to maintain the painting's integrity. Use a method of placing a dot of paint to match values by squinting to see if it disappears, indicating a match.</p>

<h2>Mixing and Adjusting Values</h2>

<p>Start mixing values with the <strong>average light</strong> and adjust for highlights and halftones. Keep halftones lighter rather than too dark to avoid ruining the painting. Halftones are part of the light family and help create the illusion of form. Highlights or crest lights represent planes facing the light source. Maintain a balance within the light family to avoid values straying into another family.</p>

<h2>Maintaining Balance and Separation</h2>

<p>Maintain balance within the light family and experiment with pushing the limits of values. See how much can be achieved with three values before they disconnect. Avoid using white on skin unless depicting a reflective surface like olive oil. Ensure light values are distinct and not too close to each other.</p>

<h2>Understanding Shadows and Reflected Light</h2>

<p>Mix an average shadow color based on your own skin tone by considering light strength and contrast. Stronger light increases contrast between light and dark areas. Shadows can vary in darkness, with reflected light affecting only shadow areas. Avoid painting opaque black shadows, aim for realistic shadow values. Ensure reflected light in shadows is distinct from light areas to avoid confusion.</p>

<h2>Exercises and Practice</h2>

<p>Practice creating a mental template for light and shadow values. Use exercises to internalize value separation in painting. Label and understand different skin tone values: average light, highlight, halftone, and average shadow. Squinting helps simplify and average values in nature. Darker values within shadows can occur due to creases or dark objects. The term "accent" refers to the darkest darks within shadows. Shadows should blend and not attract attention, allowing light areas to stand out.</p>

<h2>Transitioning to Full-Color Painting</h2>

<p>Use black and white to understand values before adding color. For full-color painting, add alizarin crimson and yellow ocher pale to black and white. Focus on understanding values and transitioning to full-color painting.</p>

<h2>Creating a Value Chart Assignment</h2>

<p>Your task is to create a chart with two families of three values. Ensure the families remain distinct and separate in the chart. Use only black and white for this assignment. This task is intended to be straightforward and not overly challenging. Proceed with the task and share your results.</p>
