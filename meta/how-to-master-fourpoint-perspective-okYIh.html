<p>I want to walk you through the idea of using <strong>four-point perspective</strong> for drawings in animation and film. It’s a perspective system that opens up <strong>wider angles</strong> and helps us move the camera in ways that simpler perspectives (like one-, two-, or three-point) cannot. I often think of four-point perspective on a <strong>spherical</strong> grid, with curved lines that converge off to various vanishing points.</p>

<h2>Why Spherical Perspective?</h2>

<p>It helps to compare this to a <strong>planet</strong> with an equator, and a prime meridian. Imagine you’re looking at the Earth, and you draw a plus sign across it, so that it’s split into four basic zones. If I frame my view on one portion of the surface, I see only that part of the sphere. From that viewpoint, I might be dealing with fewer vanishing points, maybe three. But if I shift my viewpoint, and show more of the sphere, I can get four or even five points.</p>

<p>When we set up a drawing, we place our <strong>frame</strong> (or what the camera sees) over a portion of that sphere. Whichever slice of the sphere lands in the frame determines whether we have three-, four-, or five-point perspective visible.</p>

<h2>Comparing 3-, 4-, and 5-Point Perspective</h2>

<p>• <strong>Three-Point Perspective</strong> appears when we focus on a certain section where only three vanishing points are visible (for instance, left, right, and above or below).<br />

• <strong>Four-Point Perspective</strong> appears when we see a bit more of the sphere, making both the left and right sides visible as well as the points above or below. The horizon curving across the center is clear, and we can see both sides of forms.<br />

• <strong>Five-Point Perspective</strong> is the entire sphere, where you can look around in every direction. It’s rare to see the entire five-point spread unless you draw a full panoramic world.</p>

<h2>Setting Up Four-Point Perspective</h2>

<p>If I place a frame that includes both the left and right sides of buildings, plus the verticals above or below, I end up with <strong>four vanishing points</strong>. For example:

1. One vanishing point might lie in the center (straight ahead).<br />

2. Another is far to the left, where lines converge.<br />

3. A third is far to the right, for the opposite lines.<br />

4. The fourth can be above or below, depending on whether we see upward or downward.</p>

<p>I always <strong>focus on the ground plane first</strong>. If I can see how the ground curves on my spherical grid, I can use that as a base. Everything else will radiate from that plane, including the buildings and forms on top.</p>

<h2>Camera Shots and Panning</h2>

<p>Four-point perspective also allows for more <strong>dynamic camera moves</strong>:

• <strong>Panning</strong>: We can draw a large, wide-angle scene and move the camera from left to right (or right to left) across the entire drawing.<br />

• <strong>Trucking in or out</strong>: We start with a wide frame, then move in closer to a subject, or pull out to reveal more of an environment.</p>

<p>In animation, a large four-point perspective drawing is often used for <strong>chase scenes</strong>, <strong>wide establishing shots</strong>, or any scenario where we need extra freedom to move the camera. The viewer only sees the <strong>portion of the scene</strong> inside the camera’s frame, so we can shift that frame around to follow characters, reveal hidden areas, or track across detailed cityscapes.</p>

<h2>Practical Example</h2>

<p>If I’m drawing a building from a high angle, I might see only one side, which suggests three vanishing points. But if I tilt the camera so I can see both the left and right sides, that introduces a fourth vanishing point off to the side. With a wider field of view, I can show more of that sphere, giving me room for pans or other dramatic camera moves.</p>

<p>Taking a <strong>panorama photo</strong> on a phone is a real-world example. By sweeping left to right, I effectively create a broad four- or five-point perspective image flattened onto a rectangle. The software calculates how to merge that spherical distortion into a single continuous image. In animation and concept art, we do the same thing manually with pencil lines that curve toward these invisible vanishing points.</p>

<p>Four-point perspective is powerful because it <strong>frees us from the limitations</strong> of simpler perspective constructions. By thinking of our scene on a sphere, we can place our frame to show a wider or narrower angle. Once we understand how these points work, we can design environments that allow for big, cinematic moves. That’s why four-point perspective is a favorite for <strong>storyboarding</strong>, <strong>concept art</strong>, and <strong>layout</strong> in the industry. It’s about flexibility, dynamic angles, and letting the viewer explore a wider world through the camera’s eye.</p>
