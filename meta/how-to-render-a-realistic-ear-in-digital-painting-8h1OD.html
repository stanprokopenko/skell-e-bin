<p>Congratulations on reaching the final section of the Ear Chapter! In this lesson, I'll guide you through a <strong>full color rendering of an ear</strong>. We'll work step by step, starting from a color wash and moving towards the final touches.</p>

<h2>Starting with a Color Wash</h2>

<p>I like to begin my paintings by adding a <strong>color wash</strong>. I typically choose either <strong>cadmium orange</strong> or <strong>cadmium red</strong>. For this rendering, I'll use <strong>cadmium red-orange</strong> at <strong>96% opacity</strong>. This sets a warm base for the painting.</p>

<h2>Rough Gesture Drawing</h2>

<p>Next, I create a <strong>rough gesture drawing</strong>. I select a line color that's still colorized, moving the color wheel down to a darker range with about <strong>40% saturation</strong>.</p>

<p>I start by drawing the back line of the <strong>jaw</strong> and <strong>cheekbone</strong>, where the ear attaches. Then, I sketch the <strong>base clef shape</strong> to outline the ear. I break down the interior shapes using:</p>

<ul>

<li>A large <strong>hook shape</strong> for the inner lines of the <strong>helix</strong></li>

<li>Smaller <strong>hook shapes</strong> for the <strong>antihelix</strong> and <strong>tragus</strong></li>

</ul>

<p>I use <strong>straights</strong> to define the secondary shapes of the ear's silhouette. Combining straights with curves adds a nice sense of structure to the sketch.</p>

<p>I also map out the <strong>lights and darks</strong>, filling in areas like the sideburns and cast shadows. I roughly indicate the <strong>core shadows</strong> at the base of the earlobe and sketch in the <strong>earrings</strong>.</p>

<h2>Organizing Layers</h2>

<p>I keep the drawing on its own layer. Keeping elements on separate layers allows for quick corrections. In Photoshop, you can check a single layer by holding down <strong>Alt</strong> and clicking the eye icon next to the layer.</p>

<p>I ensure my line work doesn't have any opaque paint that could obstruct underlying colors. I label my layers for better organization.</p>

<h2>Blocking in Flat Local Colors</h2>

<p>I create another layer between the wash and the line work. Using a <strong>textured square brush</strong>, I block out the <strong>flat local colors</strong>:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Skin tone</strong>: I find the local color by looking at the midtones. The skin leans more towards <strong>ochre</strong> than red, so I adjust accordingly.</li>

<li><strong>Earrings</strong>: I use a darker <strong>gold color</strong> to stand out from the skin.</li>

<li><strong>Hair</strong>: It's a dark brown, almost black. I lighten it slightly to allow room for dark accents later.</li>

</ul>

<p>To match the composition of the reference image, I adjust the canvas to remove unnecessary space.</p>

<h2>Separating Lights and Darks</h2>

<p>I create a new layer between the <strong>local colors</strong> and the <strong>line work</strong>, called <strong>Lights and Darks</strong>. Here, I focus on the <strong>graphic separation of light and shadow</strong> without worrying about gradients or highlights.</p>

<p>I start by blocking in the <strong>shadow shapes</strong> within the ear, which are more saturated and in the reds due to the many blood vessels. I fill in the cast shadows of the rings, sideburns, and strands of hair.</p>

<p>I also block in the shadows for the hair, making them slightly more saturated and dark.</p>

<h2>Adding Midtones and Highlights</h2>

<p>I create another layer and start pulling out the <strong>midtones and highlights</strong>:</p>

<ul>

<li>I use the <strong>lasso tool</strong> to select the highlights in the hair and fill them in, keeping the shapes graphic.</li>

<li>I adjust the line work by colorizing and lightening it to match the underlying colors.</li>

<li>I begin painting over the line work to make it feel more like a painting.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Refining the Edges</h2>

<p>To soften the edges and blend colors, I use a <strong>blender brush</strong>. This helps transition from the flat graphic shapes to a more rendered look. I also reintroduce some <strong>straights</strong> to define the structure of the ear.</p>

<h2>Adding Subsurface Scattering</h2>

<p>Ears have a lot of <strong>subsurface scattering</strong> due to their thinness and blood vessels. I add this effect by introducing more <strong>red and orange hues</strong> in areas where light shines through the ear:</p>

<ul>

<li>Around the <strong>helix</strong> and <strong>concha</strong></li>

<li>Near the <strong>core shadows</strong> and <strong>cast shadows</strong></li>

<li>At the base of the <strong>earlobe</strong></li>

</ul>

<p>This creates <strong>hot areas of saturation</strong> that mimic light being scattered under the skin.</p>

<h2>Adding Dark Accents and Highlights</h2>

<p>I add <strong>dark accents</strong> to deepen the shadows:</p>

<ul>

<li>In the <strong>core shadows</strong></li>

<li>Under the <strong>earlobe</strong></li>

<li>In the crevices of the ear</li>

</ul>

<p>Then, I enhance the <strong>highlights</strong>:</p>

<ul>

<li>Focusing on areas where the planes are perpendicular to the light source</li>

<li>Using cooler colors like <strong>cyans</strong> and <strong>lavenders</strong> for contrast</li>

</ul>

<h2>Final Touches</h2>

<p>I refine the painting by:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Softening edges</strong> with the blender brush</li>

<li>Adding <strong>modeling lines</strong> to create more form</li>

<li>Balancing <strong>large, medium, and small brushstrokes</strong></li>

<li>Introducing small details like <strong>peach fuzz</strong> on the back of the neck</li>

<li>Creating a rough border to keep the piece feeling sketchy, as it's a study</li>

</ul>

<h2>Summary of the Process</h2>

<p>To recap, the steps we followed are:</p>

<ol>

<li><strong>Color Wash</strong>: Applied a cadmium red-orange wash at 96% opacity.</li>

<li><strong>Gesture Drawing</strong>: Created a rough sketch with colorized lines.</li>

<li><strong>Blocking Local Colors</strong>: Added flat colors for skin, hair, and earrings.</li>

<li><strong>Separating Lights and Darks</strong>: Defined shadow shapes in the ear and hair.</li>

<li><strong>Adding Midtones and Highlights</strong>: Pulled out highlights, focusing on key areas.</li>

<li><strong>Refining Edges</strong>: Used a blender brush to soften edges and blend colors.</li>

<li><strong>Subsurface Scattering</strong>: Introduced reds and oranges to mimic light under the skin.</li>

<li><strong>Dark Accents and Highlights</strong>: Enhanced depth with darker shadows and brighter highlights.</li>

<li><strong>Final Touches</strong>: Refined edges, added details, and balanced brushwork.</li>

</ol>

<h2>Ear Anatomy Review</h2>

<p>To finish, let's revisit the parts of the ear:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Helix</strong>: The outer rim of the ear</li>

<li><strong>Antihelix</strong>: The inner ridge parallel to the helix</li>

<li><strong>Tragus</strong>: The small pointed eminence in front of the ear canal</li>

<li><strong>Antitragus</strong>: Opposite the tragus, above the earlobe</li>

<li><strong>Concha</strong>: The hollow next to the ear canal</li>

<li><strong>Earlobe</strong>: The soft lower part of the ear</li>

</ul>
