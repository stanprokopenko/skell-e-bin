<p>In this guide, I'll walk you through the process of creating a painting with a limited color palette to achieve a sense of light and color. We'll cover the initial setup, color selection, painting techniques, and final touches.</p>

<h2>Initial Setup</h2>

<p>Start by deciding the overall temperature of your light source. For my painting, I chose a <strong>warm, inviting orange</strong>. Shadows should be the opposite color, like blue. Use <strong>two colors in light and two in shadow</strong> to give a broader range without being overwhelmed.</p>

<p>Generate a line drawing using Photoshop tools:

1. Duplicate the layer.

2. Apply the filter: Stylize &gt; Find Edges.

3. Adjust levels and desaturate.</p>

<p>Clean up the line drawing manually with a brush. Focus on painting characters, not the background, which will be a spotlight color. Change the line drawing layer to multiply, rename, and lock it.</p>

<h2>Color Selection</h2>

<p>Split the warm light into two hues (orange and green) and the shadows into two hues (purple and blue). Lay in these four colors at the bottom of the canvas for easy sampling. Flood the background with a cool light to make the warm light pop. Simplify the background to pure color, using a lighter blue around the characters.</p>

<p>Lay in saturated versions of colors first, then build neutrals into them. Start with local colors:

- <strong>Green for the monster</strong>

- <strong>Peachy reddish for the girl</strong>

- <strong>Dark for her hair</strong></p>

<h2>Painting Techniques</h2>

<p>Remove all white from the canvas to avoid it looking like pure light. Determine where light and shadow are, using the chosen colors. Create a new layer in multiply mode for shadows, using desaturated blues and purples. Introduce both shadow colors early on to ensure they are present in the appropriate areas. Use cast shadows to anchor characters in perspective.</p>

<p>Switch to light colors, using overlay mode to block in light with an orangey color. Hide the line drawing to let the light define the painting. Carry colors through the painting for cohesion and color harmony. Darken the background with purple to make the monster's shadows pop. Flatten the shadow layer onto the background layer. Add an occlusion pass to the monster for ambient occlusion.</p>

<p>Build lighter and darker values, warmer and cooler colors, and adjust edges. Get the characters' eyes in early to bring them to life and guide the painting process. Sample shadow colors and introduce blues by desaturating them to bring them closer to green. Use desaturated blue for ambient light, making the environment affect the shadows. Ensure the environment influences the characters' appearance for credibility in color and light. Build the palette by bridging light and shadow colors, maintaining warm vs. cool balance.</p>

<h2>Refining the Painting</h2>

<p>Indicate the monster's teeth and find spots for purple, like rosy cheeks. Use deep purple to ensure the monster reads light over dark. <strong>Value contrast</strong> (light over dark or dark over light) is crucial for clarity. Add structure to the monster's head to suggest a skull and eye sockets.</p>

<p>Work on the child character, adding basic features like eyes, nose, and hands. Ensure a pleasing silhouette shape for her hair. Figure out the dimensions of the book she's holding. Add occlusion shadows where the book and dress meet the monster. Bring all areas of the painting up at the same time.</p>

<p>Use a smudge tool with texture to create a diffuse edge on the monster's fur. Use a multiply brush to darken the edges, creating a vignette effect. Use an overlay brush with saturated blue to push the color temperature to be colder. Maintain areas with varied color temperatures to keep the painting interesting. Add variety to the light area of the monster's belly with greens and oranges. Render tufts of fur sprouting from the monster's belly to sell the furry texture.</p>

<p>Use oranges for the lips instead of red to stay within the palette. Add occlusion to the girl's eye sockets and define her nose with reflected light. Block in the girl's fingers and create an overall shadow pass on her dress. Darken areas with ambient occlusion and ensure the monster's form feels like it's turning. Add horizontal strokes on the water to catch light and lighten it up. Warm up the water with desaturated strokes and purple hues.</p>

<p>Explore with blues, scumbling them in to fill out the color temperature range. Use the smudge tool to mix colors more like pigment, creating minute color temperature changes. Blend hairs into the monster's body and stand out only outside the silhouette. Flip the painting to ensure the reflected light is concentrated at the top. Darken and warm the monster's head as it turns away from the sky. Add highlights to give characters a boost, especially cartoony ones. Reflect the light source or the lighter surrounding environment in highlights.</p>

<p>Scumble in slightly warmer hues to balance the cool tones used earlier. Increase the saturation of purple to remind the viewer of its presence in the palette. Zoom in to refine the design and drawing of the girl character, focusing on shapes and values. Add reflected light from the environment onto her hair and consider the hair tie's shadow. Use other colors in the hair, like greens, to carry the palette through. Use the smudge tool for ambient occlusion and creating soft edges.</p>

<p>Add light to the pages of the book and use the smudge tool for fun with edges. Use desaturated orange to vary the temperature of the girl's dress. Fix hard-edged shapes that don't feel like fur by adding varied edges and textures. Work on the center light area of the monster's belly with textured strokes. Use cooler greens sparingly for temperature play. Use a soft airbrush in linear dodge mode to indicate God rays and create a nostalgic value. Add blue hue carefully to strengthen reflected light without overpowering.</p>

<p>Fix logistical issues like the book intersecting the girl's leg. Ensure proper lighting and occlusion where elements collide. Add small details like highlights and occlusion to position elements in space. Indicate text on the book abstractly to show it's a book without needing readability.</p>

<h2>Final Touches</h2>

<p>Know when a painting is finished by tweaking smaller shapes and ensuring color dispersion. Save the painting and revisit it later to determine if it's done. Adding more elements isn't always necessary for a painting to feel finished. Show the painting to someone not an artist for valuable feedback. Zoom in to have fun with color temperatures and add saturated color notes.</p>

<p>Use a dark background color to carve out the girl's face and ensure visibility. Separate the top plane of her hand from her face with cooler skin tones. Add reflections in the water using overlay mode and sampling colors from the monster. Ensure reflections include all palette colors to feel part of the painting. Add a final touch of glow to enhance the magical light effect.</p>

<p>Despite its complexity, the painting uses only four colors.</p>
