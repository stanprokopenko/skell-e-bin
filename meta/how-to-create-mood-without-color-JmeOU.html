<p>Hi, I’m Tiffany, a color key artist in the animation industry. I love exploring how <strong>value</strong> is directly linked to <strong>mood</strong>. In this lesson, I’ll demonstrate how simple value structures can create complex, compelling color and mood in a painting. We’ll look at a photo reference I took near where I live, and see how adjusting values changes the mood, even without touching color.</p>

<h2>Simplifying the Value Structure</h2>

<p>I took a photo of a cargo-like boat near sunset. At first glance, you might see separate values for the sky, water, mountains, and boat. But when I convert it to black and white, the major shapes become much simpler. For example, the sky and the mountains merge into nearly the same value, forming one large mass. The boat becomes a strong <strong>light-on-dark</strong> statement.</p>

<p>This demonstrates the core idea: even if the color scheme is complex, the <strong>value structure</strong> can remain simple and dramatic. Using only a few values (often three or four) can create a clear and effective painting.</p>

<h2>Adjusting Contrast to Affect Mood</h2>

<p>To show how value affects mood, I experiment with Photoshop adjustment layers:</p>

<ol>

<li><strong>Curves</strong>: Sliding values darker can <strong>somber</strong> the scene. Increasing contrast can make the mood feel more intense or stark.</li>

<li><strong>Levels</strong>: Shifting toward a <strong>high-key</strong> (lighter than mid-gray) or <strong>low-key</strong> (darker than mid-gray) palette changes the emotional tone. High-key can feel ghostly or serene. Low-key can feel dramatic or moody.</li>

<li><strong>Exposure</strong>: Tweaking exposure can <strong>gray out</strong> the image, creating a musty, atmospheric look. Selectively erasing portions of the adjustment layer can emphasize focal areas.</li>

</ol>

<h2>Building a New Value Structure</h2>

<p>By stacking these adjustments, I can invent a new time of day or create an alternate atmosphere. For instance, I might darken the overall scene, but keep the boat as a bright accent. Or I could lighten the background, so it feels like early morning. The key is remembering that values exist in <strong>relationships</strong>, and any extreme changes to one area must still work with the values around it.</p>

<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>

<p>• A simple <strong>light and dark structure</strong> is the backbone of a painting’s mood.<br />

• <strong>High-contrast</strong> images often appear more dramatic or intense.<br />

• <strong>Low-contrast</strong> images can feel softer or more somber.<br />

• Experimenting with <strong>adjustment layers</strong> (Curves, Levels, Exposure) is a quick way to discover how different values alter the mood of a scene.  </p>

<p>In my next steps, I’ll show how to start with a black and white reference and choose color in inventive ways, always guided by the underlying value. It’s an exciting approach that opens up countless possibilities for creating evocative, mood-driven art.</p>
