<p>Before diving into the line category of our course, I have a fun warm-up exercise to get your hand moving and practice drawing <strong>ellipses</strong>. While doodling with my son, I realized that drawing <strong>Mario mushrooms</strong> is the perfect way to make ellipse practice more engaging.</p>

<h2>The Mario Mushroom Exercise</h2>

<p>Instead of randomly drawing ellipses on a page, we'll draw Mario mushrooms, which consist of <strong>eight ellipses</strong> placed intentionally:</p>

<ol>

<li>The <strong>connecting ellipse</strong> where the head meets the body.</li>

<li>The <strong>cap</strong> of the mushroom.</li>

<li>The <strong>body</strong> ellipse.</li>

<li>and 5. The <strong>eyes</strong>.</li>

<li>The <strong>circle</strong> on the front of the cap.</li>

<li>and 8. The <strong>dots</strong> on the sides of the cap.</li>

</ol>

<p>Feel free to play with proportions, make the mushrooms taller, wider, or change the size of the cap and body. This keeps the exercise fun and ensures you're not just repeating the same shapes.</p>

<h2>Focus Points</h2>

<ul>

<li><strong>Pressure Control</strong>: Practice varying line pressure, make visible lines <strong>darker</strong> and hidden lines <strong>lighter</strong>. This adds depth to your drawings.</li>

<li><strong>Placement and Alignment</strong>: Focus on aligning the ellipses correctly. Imagine each ellipse before drawing it, and <strong>ghost</strong> the motion with your hand before putting pencil to paper.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Tips for Practice</h2>

<ul>

<li><strong>Don't Rush</strong>: Take your time. If you draw faster than you think, mistakes happen.</li>

<li><strong>Relax Your Hand</strong>: Avoid gripping the pencil too hard. If your hand hurts, shake it out and relax your grip.</li>

<li><strong>Avoid Overworking Lines</strong>: Draw each ellipse in one motion without going back to clean up.</li>

</ul>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p>Fill your page with varied mushrooms, change angles, sizes, and proportions. This not only warms up your hand, but also improves your ellipse drawing skills in a fun way. If mushrooms get boring, try other simple shapes with ellipses or curves. Enjoy the process, and feel free to share your pages with the community. We're starting the line category soon!</p>
