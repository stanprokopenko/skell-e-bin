<h2>Bulging Box Concept</h2>

<p>You can start by imagining the hand as a <strong>bulging box</strong>. This works for both the palm side and the back side. Inflate its sides or edges slightly to capture the hand’s rounded form. Keep your <strong>gesture</strong> in mind so the overall flow stays lively and natural.</p>

<h2>Palm Side Landmarks</h2>

<p>You have several important landmarks on the palm side:<br />

- <strong>Thenar eminence</strong> (the fleshy muscle at the base of the thumb).<br />

- <strong>Heel of the palm</strong> (the pad near your wrist).<br />

- A small <strong>pad</strong> protecting where the fingers meet the palm.</p>

<p>These pads create a <strong>dish-like curve</strong> in the palm that helps you hold objects (like eggs). Even in basic shapes, show this subtle cupping. The thumb connects near the wrist, separate from the four fingers.</p>

<h2>Back of the Hand</h2>

<p>On the back side of the hand, you can still imagine a <strong>bulging box</strong>, but the bulge includes knuckles and the area where the thumb meets. In this view, the <strong>hand overlaps the thumb</strong> at the base. Notice the extra width where the thumb’s structure begins near the wrist.</p>

<h2>Constructing the Thumb</h2>

<p>The thumb has three sections (like the other fingers), but it starts closer to the wrist:<br />

1. <strong>Base</strong>: Often drawn as an egg shape or a boxy form for the thenar eminence.<br />

2. <strong>Mid-section</strong>: Shorter than the base.<br />

3. <strong>Tip</strong>: Holds the thumbnail and has a slight hook.  </p>

<p>From the back, the tip can look like a <strong>spoon shape</strong>, angled differently than the fingers. From the palm side, the thumb overlaps the hand structure.</p>

<h2>Fingers and Their Proportions</h2>

<p>Each finger has three sections (joints):<br />

1. <strong>Longest section</strong> at the base, starting where the finger meets the hand.<br />

2. <strong>Second section</strong> at about two-thirds of the first.<br />

3. <strong>Third (tip) section</strong> at about two-thirds of the second.</p>

<p>Together, the middle finger is roughly the same length as the entire back of the hand. The pointer and ring fingers are usually a bit shorter, and the little finger is the smallest. Each finger’s <strong>nail</strong> often faces straight out, unlike the thumb’s angled nail.</p>

<h2>Curves and Overlaps</h2>

<p>When fingers bend, observe the <strong>gesture</strong> of each joint. Sometimes all joints show a rhythm curving in or out as they flex. The <strong>thumb</strong> often forms an <strong>S-curve</strong>, hooking at the tip. These overlapping shapes give the hand its realistic appearance.</p>

<h2>Final Tips</h2>

<p>• Use the <strong>bulging box</strong> idea to place the hand in perspective.<br />

• Identify the <strong>pads and arches</strong> that shape the palm.<br />

• Map each <strong>finger joint</strong> carefully, using the two-thirds rule.<br />

• Distinguish the <strong>thumb</strong> by starting it near the wrist and giving it its own three-part structure.<br />

• Observe <strong>overlaps</strong>. On the palm side, the thumb overlaps the hand, and on the back side, the hand overlaps the thumb.</p>

<p>Practice different poses to feel how these forms change from one angle to another. This helps you capture the <strong>gestural flow</strong> and structure of any hand pose you draw.</p>
