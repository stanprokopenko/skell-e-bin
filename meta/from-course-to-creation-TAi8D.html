<h2>Celebrate Your Progress</h2>

<p>Congratulations on reaching the end of the course! You've explored essential aspects of comic creation and made significant strides in your learning.</p>

<h2>Dive Deeper into Comic Creation</h2>

<p>Now that you have a broad understanding of the process, it's time to dive even deeper into one of those topics. Consider specializing in <strong>penciling</strong>, <strong>inking</strong>, or <strong>coloring</strong> so you have one skill to headline your art. Knowing the entire workflow allows you to account for each step of the process, no matter where you're at in the pipeline.</p>

<h2>Focus on Improvement Areas</h2>

<p>Think about what you want to improve most in your work and focus your energy there.</p>

<ul>

<li>If you want to draw better-looking characters, there are more <strong>figure drawing and anatomy</strong> courses you can dive into next.</li>

<li>If environments are more your thing, <strong>perspective and landscapes</strong> can be your focus.</li>

<li>If you found yourself struggling with the fundamentals and making basic shapes three-dimensional, then the <strong>Drawing Basics</strong> course could be where you're headed next.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Keep Making Art</h2>

<p>No course will be as important as <strong>making art</strong>. Does finishing the course mean that you're a master at comic books? Probably not, but you have the <strong>foundation</strong> that will get you there much faster. The only way to keep improving is to <strong>put your skills to use</strong>.</p>

<p>Make comics that <strong>excite</strong> or <strong>interest</strong> you. Write your own scripts, create your own characters, and <strong>have some fun</strong>.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p>I've been honored to bring you this course and work with all the amazing artists who made this possible. Now, go make some comics. See you later!</p>
