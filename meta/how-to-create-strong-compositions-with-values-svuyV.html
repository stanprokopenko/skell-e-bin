<p>Welcome back, everyone. This is the fourth and final demo for composition thumbnails. I'll be working on a piece featuring a sorcerer, or at least someone who looks like he's performing magic with a light source. I've decided to use markers again, because I really enjoyed it last time. This project is perfect for exploring markers further, so I might as well make the most of it.</p>

<h2>Choosing Materials</h2>

<p>I'm using the <strong>red-gray set of markers</strong> from the Proko gray set that we collaborated on. It comes with three different temperatures:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Cool Grays</strong>: These have a subtle hint of blue.</li>

<li><strong>Warm Grays</strong>: These lean towards a yellowish brown.</li>

<li><strong>Red Grays</strong>: These have a slight reddish brown tint.</li>

</ul>

<p>All of them are light to dark grays with muted tones, not vibrant colors. I'm using these three plus white, which gives me flexibility. I can use any two of these along with white or all three without white.</p>

<h2>Approach to Thumbnails</h2>

<p>One thing I noticed from my previous thumbnail is that I tried to stay a bit too clean. I even used a ruler, which is fine depending on your personality. But when I do thumbnails, I don't want to be too clean because it makes me uptight. I tend to avoid making mistakes and hold back, which isn't good for exploration. So, I'm going to go through this a bit more messy, not bad messy, but without being distracted by cleanliness.</p>

<h2>Analyzing the Reference</h2>

<p>The reference image has a very bright shape in the middle with a dark background. At first glance, it feels like the bottom lights are brighter than the top, but if you look closely, the light on the hat is actually a bit brighter. The warm, hot orange light at the bottom contrasts with the cold background, making it stand out more.</p>

<p>There are cold lights on top and warm lights on the bottom. While these markers would be perfect for exploring temperature differences, I don't want to get into color too much here. My focus is on <strong>values</strong>.</p>

<h2>First Thumbnail</h2>

<p>For the first thumbnail, I'm exploring without worrying about proportions, or being too clean. I quickly drew the basic shape, a person with a hat and hands outstretched. I'm not measuring, I just want to get the idea.</p>

<p>I notice a darker area at the bottom, which is a cast shadow on the wall caused by his body. In the background, there's a <strong>vignette</strong> where the corners are darker, and there's a lighter spot in the middle.</p>

<p>Within the figure, there are darks under the jaw and chin, and the shoulders are raised close to the ears because he's hunching forward. There are folds in the drapery, like a <strong>diaper fold</strong> where the fabric drapes between two points, the shoulders in this case.</p>

<p>I add mid values where needed, keeping the hands in the lighter value to make them stand out. I'm focusing on three values: the white of the paper, mid value, and dark.</p>

<h2>Second Thumbnail</h2>

<p>In the second thumbnail, I explore a <strong>fully dark background</strong>, silhouetting the figure. I map it in with the darkest marker. This creates a strong composition with a bold statement. The figure stands out clearly against the dark background.</p>

<p>I make the hands a mid value to see how that affects the composition. I ensure there's enough contrast around the hands to keep them visible.</p>

<h2>Third Thumbnail</h2>

<p>For the third thumbnail, I adjust the background by putting dark only at the top. This provides more contrast at the top of the figure and brings the viewer's eye upward. I extend the mid-value background beyond the hands, making the high contrast at the top draw more attention.</p>

<p>I like all three thumbnails, but if I had to eliminate one, it might be the first one because the other two feel a bit stronger.</p>

<h2>Fourth Thumbnail</h2>

<p>In the fourth thumbnail, I simplify further by being conservative with the darkest details. I keep the hands as <strong>pure white</strong> and minimize mid tones and darks within the figure, strengthening the silhouette.</p>

<p>I notice that having the light extend all the way up creates a more powerful silhouette. In previous thumbnails, splitting the light made the lower light stand out too much. Here, the continuous light up the figure doesn't overly emphasize any one area.</p>

<h2>Fifth Thumbnail</h2>

<p>Next, I explore the idea of having the main light source coming from the top rather than the bottom. If the light is from above, I consider putting more space above his head to represent light coming down. I place light at the top in the background, using vertical strokes to depict light descending.</p>

<p>I feel there's too much empty space above, so in a more detailed version, I might add subtle value differences or shapes in the air to fill that space.</p>

<h2>Sixth Thumbnail</h2>

<p>For the sixth thumbnail, I combine ideas from previous thumbnails. I try having a dark area at the top with a mid-value light shape, perhaps like a ray coming down. However, it doesn't feel as good as the smaller, separate light shapes in earlier thumbnails. I decide I don't like this one as much.</p>

<h2>Choosing the Best Composition</h2>

<p>Comparing the thumbnails, I find that the <strong>fourth one is the strongest</strong>. The continuous light up the figure creates a powerful silhouette without overemphasizing the lower or upper areas. While I like aspects of several thumbnails, I have to make a decision, so I choose the fourth one to develop further.</p>

<h2>Final Larger Thumbnail</h2>

<p>I prepare to do a larger version of the chosen thumbnail. With more space, I have room to add more detail and introduce additional values if needed. I'm working with four values: the white of the paper, a light mid value, a dark mid value, and black.</p>

<p>I carefully block in the background and the figure. I keep the face in shadow to maintain some mystery, but I add indications of features for more detail. I use the extra value to differentiate areas within the light, adding depth and interest.</p>

<p>I add darker accents where needed, especially around the hands and face, to enhance the focal points. The overall composition feels strong, and I'm happy with how it turned out.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p>Throughout this process, I've made many decisions about composition, values, and details. Even though the final image may resemble the reference at first glance, the thoughtful adjustments make a big difference. Thinking through the composition and experimenting helps create a more powerful final piece.</p>

<p>I hope you're getting more comfortable with values because we'll be moving on to shading with light and form, thinking about how values can make something look three-dimensional. Critiques are coming up next, and then we'll move on to lighting.</p>
