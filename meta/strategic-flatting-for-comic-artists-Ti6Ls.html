<h2>Working with Intention</h2>

<p>When I approach flatting a comic page, I always <strong>work with intention</strong>. Instead of coloring panels randomly, I plan ahead to avoid setting myself up for failure. By understanding the script and pinpointing key <strong>story beats</strong>, I can enhance the visual impact and ensure I'm not leaving anything on the table.</p>

<h2>Approaching a Page</h2>

<p>Comic scripts often come with a lot of words and complex art. To tackle this, I read the script and look for places where the <strong>tension rises</strong> or the <strong>mood changes</strong>. Even if the artwork shows similar drawings across panels, the dialogue might suggest a shift in mood, and that's an opportunity to express that change through color.</p>

<h2>Tools and Techniques</h2>

<h3>Lasso and Wand Tools</h3>

<p>I use a combination of the <strong>lasso</strong> and <strong>wand</strong> tools in Photoshop to select areas efficiently. The lasso tool is great for <strong>straight lines and precise selections</strong>, especially when using the <strong>polygonal lasso</strong>. The wand tool, with the right settings, can help select areas based on color and line art, saving time.</p>

<h3>Filling Methods</h3>

<p>I've set up actions to <strong>fill areas at different opacities</strong>. For example, I have actions to fill at <strong>100%</strong>, <strong>40%</strong>, <strong>20%</strong>, and <strong>10%</strong> opacity. This allows me to quickly lay down different colors while flatting. Assigning these actions to keyboard shortcuts or stylus buttons speeds up the process significantly.</p>

<h2>Workflow Tips</h2>

<h3>Actions and Shortcuts</h3>

<p>Efficiency is key when flatting. I assign frequently used actions to <strong>keyboard shortcuts</strong> or <strong>mouse buttons</strong>. For instance, pressing a button fills an area with the foreground color at a specific opacity. This reduces the time spent navigating menus and lets me focus on the artwork.</p>

<h3>Efficiency and Speed</h3>

<p>The goal is to <strong>flat quickly and accurately</strong>. It's about finding a balance between being <strong>neat</strong> and <strong>fast</strong>. Developing a consistent workflow and becoming familiar with the tools allows me to flat a page in about <strong>45 minutes</strong>. Spending too much time on flatting can slow down the entire coloring process.</p>

<h2>Organizing the Image</h2>

<h3>Background to Foreground</h3>

<p>I usually work from <strong>background to foreground</strong>, tackling large, easy shapes first. This method helps in managing the complexity of the page and ensures that I don't miss any areas.</p>

<h3>Separating Planes</h3>

<p>Breaking down the image into <strong>major planes</strong> is crucial. I separate the <strong>top and side planes</strong> of objects like ice or mountains to define light and shadow. This approach simplifies the coloring stage, as I can easily select these areas later.</p>

<h2>The Importance of Clean Flats</h2>

<p>Clean flats are essential. They allow for easy selection during coloring and prevent frustration later on. While speed is important, it's vital to avoid being <strong>messy</strong>. Sloppy flats can lead to more work down the line, so I strive to keep my selections precise.</p>

<h2>Time Management in Flatting</h2>

<p>When I first started, I took time to get comfortable with the tools and develop my workflow. Now, I aim to flat a typical page in <strong>45 minutes to an hour</strong>. Meeting tight deadlines means focusing on what's important and not getting bogged down by unnecessary details.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p>Flatting is about <strong>problem-solving</strong> and organizing the image to highlight the focal points. By working with intention, using efficient techniques, and managing time effectively, you can streamline the flatting process. Remember, it's all about setting yourself up for success in the coloring stage.</p>
