<h2>Using an Egg or Box for the Hips</h2>

<p>I like to think of the <strong>hips</strong> as either an <strong>egg shape</strong> or a <strong>bulging box</strong>. Either way works. Sometimes the egg includes only the hips, sometimes I’ll add the belly onto that shape too. If I use a box, it might only be the ilium (hip bone) or it might include more of the pelvic region.</p>

<p>After I decide on my main shape, I figure out the <strong>long axis</strong> of that shape. If it’s just the hips, the axis is smaller. If it’s hips plus stomach, the axis is longer. In both cases, it’s helpful to keep the connections clear. Overlaps can show how the <strong>crotch</strong> tucks behind or how the <strong>belly</strong> attaches to that hip structure.</p>

<h2>Dropping Off the Constructed Top</h2>

<p>Once I have the hip shape in place, I look for the <strong>constructed top</strong> of the hips. From there, I <strong>drop off</strong> just a bit, straight down along the direction the leg is actually heading, and then <strong>swell</strong> outward to create that beautiful <strong>S-curve</strong> of the thigh.</p>

<p>• The <strong>drop</strong> is usually about a third of the hip’s height, sometimes more, sometimes less.<br />

• After the drop, I curve outward for the thigh.<br />

• Then I bring it down to the <strong>skinny knee</strong> and continue on to the lower leg.</p>

<p>This approach creates a gentle S-curve that moves from the <strong>hip</strong> to the <strong>knee</strong>. If you think of it in upright poses, you’ll see that same drop and swell.</p>

<h3>Connecting the Second Leg</h3>

<p>In a <strong>profile</strong> view, we usually see only one side of the hips in detail. When drawing the back leg, it often helps to come off the <strong>construction</strong> at the hip and swing right back like a <strong>slingshot</strong>. This unifies both legs at the same starting point, so they don’t feel disconnected.</p>

<p>• I let the back leg follow that same S-curve idea.<br />

• I allow for overlaps, so the viewer gets a sense that everything is joined under the hips.  </p>

<p>If you try to eyeball the second leg without referencing your constructed hip area, you might end up with legs at different proportions or awkward alignments.</p>

<h2>Another Example with a Bent Torso</h2>

<p>When the <strong>torso</strong> bends forward, the hips may flatten or squish. We still use the same hip shape, but we notice how it tilts. I might start by quickly indicating the <strong>rib cage</strong> (egg shape or box form). Then I refine the curves of the belly and the hips.</p>

<p>• From the <strong>bottom</strong> of those hips, I again drop off and curve back up into the <strong>crook of the knee</strong>.<br />

• One side might be bulging or curving more, and the other side might be straighter. That’s okay. Each side can have its own contour.  </p>

<p>This process helps keep everything manageable. I’m reducing details into simpler shapes and focusing on angles, overlaps, and proportion checks. For instance, I’ll compare the distance from the <strong>rib cage</strong> to the <strong>hips</strong> or note where the <strong>breast</strong> might touch the <strong>lap</strong>. These simple checks keep everything in proportion as I add the legs.</p>

<h2>Putting It All Together</h2>

<p>When I connect the legs, I’m combining <strong>egg shapes</strong>, <strong>S-curves</strong>, and <strong>overlaps</strong> in a logical chain. It’s a straightforward system:</p>

<ol>

<li>Choose a simple shape (egg or box) for the hips.  </li>

<li>Find that <strong>constructed top</strong> and drop slightly off of it.  </li>

<li>Swell outward to create the thigh’s curve down to the knee.  </li>

<li>Repeat or mirror the process for the second leg, using the same origin point.  </li>

<li>Keep checking proportions and overlaps, adjusting as needed.</li>

</ol>

<p>Even though I say it’s “easy,” it still takes practice and awareness. We’re compressing a lot of anatomical and structural information into <strong>simple lines</strong> and <strong>2D shapes</strong>. With patience, this approach becomes more natural.</p>

<p>Hope that helps. See you next time!</p>
