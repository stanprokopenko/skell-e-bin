<h2>Coloring Within the Lines</h2>

<p>A big part of the finishing touches for me involves coloring within the lines. I start by adding a <strong>clipping mask</strong> on top of my line work. This ensures that any coloring I do remains confined within the existing lines.</p>

<p>I choose the <strong>clean inker</strong> brush for this task since I don't need much texture here. I focus on areas related to where I've placed highlights, mainly at the edges to enhance them. Initially, I might use a placeholder color to stub in the highlights, allowing me to see how it looks across various parts of the illustration before settling on the final color.</p>

<p>I apply this to my two main characters first, ensuring I cover all the spots I want highlighted. Once that's done, I adjust the color to find the one that makes sense. The initial color might be too bright or too purple, so I experiment with different hues, like orangey tones or reds. It's important to find a balance, sometimes brighter or slightly more saturated colors work better.</p>

<p>Zooming out to view the illustration as a small thumbnail helps me gauge the overall impact of the colors. I might toggle between different shades to see what works best.</p>

<h2>Adjusting Colored Lines</h2>

<p>When coloring the lines, I need to be cautious not to overuse them. There's a version where every colored line is <strong>context-sensitive</strong>, meaning I change the color to match the material it's representing. For instance, the highlight color on the skin might differ from that on the bunny outfit. If time permits, I might go back and adjust these individually.</p>

<p>Using one highlight color makes a strong stylistic statement and creates a cohesive palette. However, context-sensitive colors can give a more polished feel. For now, I proceed with a single color to see how it looks.</p>

<p>Sometimes, I extend the colored lines beyond where the highlight is. For example, on thin surfaces like leaves, the highlight implies that the edge catches light even if the form doesn't have a proper highlight. This technique can also help certain elements pop out, like adding colored lines to parts of the motorcycle or the character's hand.</p>

<p>I reserve highlights on background elements, such as buildings, since they occupy a different space and might require a different color. Keeping them on a separate layer allows me to adjust them independently.</p>

<h2>Enhancing Readability with Line Color</h2>

<p>Certain features, like the cat friend's eyebrow hairs, might read better if I keep them black while coloring the highlights on the rest of him. This contrast helps retain important details that might otherwise get obscured.</p>

<p>If needed, I might add highlights to areas without them to improve readability, like her backside. This acts almost like a hair light, emphasizing the shape.</p>

<p>After applying the colored lines, I review the illustration to ensure nothing becomes less readable. If an area looks off, I might add more coloring to complete the effect or remove it altogether. It's important to double-check these details.</p>

<h2>Adding Highlights to the Background</h2>

<p>For the background, I consider using a secondary color for the lines. I'm thinking of a <strong>pink, brighter, and more saturated</strong> color. I try applying it to the background elements and then adjust the color and darkness to ensure the shapes still read well. It's a bit of experimentation to find the right balance, possibly darkening it or adjusting the intensity.</p>

<h2>Final Touches</h2>

<h3>Eye Light Details</h3>

<p>As a finishing touch, I like to add a bit of an <strong>eye light</strong>. Using a very bright white and the <strong>2D inker</strong> brush at a smaller size, I add subtle highlights to the eyes. This is done on top of everything else, mimicking how a real eye light functions. It's not enough to just make it brighter, it needs to cover up the line work to have the desired effect.</p>

<h3>Adding a Glow Effect</h3>

<p>Next, I add a bit of <strong>glow work</strong> on top of everything. Unlike previous steps that were within the line work, this adds another layer over the geometry. I select a <strong>soft brush</strong> with a soft pink color and set the layer mode to <strong>soft light</strong> with medium opacity.</p>

<p>I apply this subtly to create a <strong>bloom effect</strong>, softening some of the line work and giving one last chance to accentuate the highlights. It's about enhancing the overall mood and adding that final touch of polish. I might adjust the opacity to get it just right.</p>

<h2>Wrapping Up the Process</h2>

<p>This concludes my full art process from start to finish in creating an illustration. To recap:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Research and Gathering References</strong>: I started by getting familiar with the subject matter I wanted to draw.</li>

<li><strong>Thumbnails</strong>: I planned out the composition and developed stories using the research, creating small sketches to explore ideas.</li>

<li><strong>Line Art</strong>: I refined the chosen thumbnail into detailed line work.</li>

<li><strong>Flats and Color</strong>: I added base colors (flats) and then worked on the colors, which involved making adjustments, adding shadows, and incorporating light.</li>

<li><strong>Finishing Touches</strong>: I focused on coloring within the lines, adjusting colored lines, adding eye lights, and applying glow effects.</li>

</ul>

<p>I encourage you to try out this process and see how it works for you. Feel free to share your results with me, Iâ€™d love to see them!</p>

<p>Thanks for joining me today. See you next time!</p>
