<p>In this project, I'm working on a panel featuring a celestial being covered in ice. My goal is to enhance the <strong>lighting</strong> on the celestial, especially his arm and the ice, to define the form and <strong>frame his face</strong>. I want to direct the viewer's attention to these important areas while letting other elements recede.</p>

<h2>Using Gradients for Highlights</h2>

<p>I'm starting by applying <strong>gradients</strong> to lay in values, colors, and contrast. Using gradients is a quick way to show how I'm thinking about the lighting. I select a desaturated teal, almost a gray, to add highlights on the ice. This color is cooler but not fully blue, and it's less saturated to avoid drawing attention to less important areas.</p>

<p>Around the focal points where I want to draw the eye, I use a more saturated teal. This adds <strong>saturation</strong> where needed without overwhelming the scene. I carefully select the areas to apply these effects, sometimes using the wand tool to isolate specific parts.</p>

<h2>Managing Saturation and Contrast</h2>

<p>By adjusting <strong>saturation</strong> and <strong>contrast</strong>, I can guide the viewer's eye. I introduce contrast by making the dark sides of the ice even darker, placing the darkest parts next to the lightest parts. This high contrast draws attention to the important features.</p>

<p>To add warmth, I might edge the color closer to purple, moving towards the warmer side of the color palette. This helps in creating depth and interest.</p>

<h2>Using Color Holds to Push Elements Back</h2>

<p>To push background elements like the mountains further back, I use <strong>color holds</strong> or knockouts. This involves changing the color of the inked lines from black to a color. I create a clipping mask to affect only the desired lines without altering the foreground elements.</p>

<p>By lightening the line art of the mountains and adjusting their colors, I reduce their contrast against the background, making them recede. This helps focus attention on the celestial and other foreground elements.</p>

<h2>Painting Highlights and Adding Texture</h2>

<p>I use brushes to add highlights and texture. For the mountain tops, I choose a warm color like yellow to suggest sunlight streaming in from the left. I prefer to build up layers of color gradually to avoid harsh, inorganic looks.</p>

<p>When the foreground and background elements lack separation, I adjust colors or add highlights to enhance the silhouette. By defining these edges, I ensure the important elements stand out.</p>

<h2>Working with Selections and the Lasso Tool</h2>

<p>Using the lasso tool, I make selections on the arm to apply highlights. This method, sometimes called <strong>cut and grad</strong>, involves selecting areas and filling them with color. I can repeat this process to build up highlights and shadows, working within the selections to control where the colors are applied.</p>

<p>This technique allows me to render specific areas efficiently, creating depth and form without overcomplicating the image.</p>

<h2>Defining Edges and Accentuating Silhouettes</h2>

<p>To accentuate the character's silhouette, I work on defining edges. For instance, I'll add light behind the hand to create contrast between the hand and the background. This makes the hand <strong>stand out</strong>.</p>

<p>By adjusting colors and contrasts, I ensure that the foreground elements have sharp edges against the background. This helps in directing the viewer's eye to where I want it.</p>

<h2>Balancing Warm and Cool Colors</h2>

<p>I balance <strong>warm and cool colors</strong> to create depth and atmosphere. For shadows on the arm, I might use cooler blues. For areas catching sunlight, I use warmer magentas. I consider the overall environment to decide on the color temperature.</p>

<p>For instance, if the scene has a lot of cool elements, I'll introduce warmer shadows to add contrast. This interplay between warm and cool tones enhances the visual interest.</p>

<h2>Maintaining Focus and Avoiding Over-Detailing</h2>

<p>I avoid <strong>over-rendering</strong> areas that aren't the focus. If the artist hasn't drawn detailed features, I don't add unnecessary detail in the coloring. For example, small background characters don't need highly detailed coloring.</p>

<p>I pay attention to the artist's lines and work with them. Adding too much detail can work against the art and distract from the main focus.</p>

<h2>Adjusting Background Elements</h2>

<p>In panels with less importance, I let elements <strong>recede</strong>. I might darken or desaturate areas to prevent them from drawing attention. For instance, I push background mountains further back by lightening their lines and reducing contrast.</p>

<p>When working on interiors, like a conference table scene, I use warm shadows to contrast with cooler floors. I brighten up areas where light hits directly and let the edges fade into darkness.</p>

<h2>Final Touches and Special Effects</h2>

<p>I add special effects like glows towards the end. To suggest sunlight streaming in, I use gradients set to <strong>hard light</strong> blending mode. I use selections to control where the effects are applied, preventing them from affecting unintended areas.</p>

<p>I might also enhance highlights on the characters to make them pop. These final touches help in <strong>directing the viewer's eye</strong> and enhancing the storytelling.</p>

<p>Throughout this process, I'm constantly assessing and adjusting. By managing lighting, contrast, saturation, and color temperature, I guide the viewer's attention and <strong>enhance the artwork</strong>. The goal is to support the narrative and the artist's intent, creating a cohesive and engaging image.</p>
