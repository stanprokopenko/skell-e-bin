<h2>What's in Premium?</h2>

<p>Learn to build a four-point perspective grid for dramatic, wide-angle down shots. We start by placing a high horizon line and using curved lines (warped in Photoshop) that converge at vanishing points on each side. Youâ€™ll see how to duplicate and transform these curves, add measuring lines for buildings, and use a flexible ruler to keep your angles consistent. We focus on proper scale, overlap, and quick scene layout, giving you full control over camera movement and composition.  </p>
