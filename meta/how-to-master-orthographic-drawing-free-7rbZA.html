<h2>What's in Premium?</h2>

<p>In this lesson, we explore the challenges of drawing objects from multiple orthographic views. You'll learn how to handle complex forms, like curved objects, by finding underlying straight lines and centers of curved planes. We discuss the use of auxiliary views for objects with oblique angles to ensure accurate representation.</p>

<p>The lesson provides practical approaches to simplify complex objects, emphasizing starting with right angles and swiveling objects to compare different views. Through examples like chairs, winged objects, and simplified cars, you'll see how to break down challenging forms into manageable parts.</p>

<p>We also cover the importance of consistent silhouettes in orthographic projections and how front and back views share the same outlines due to the lack of perspective distortion. By understanding these principles, you'll be better equipped to represent objects accurately from all angles.</p>
