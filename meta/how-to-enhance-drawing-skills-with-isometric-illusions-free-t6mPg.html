<h2>What's in Premium?</h2>

<p>In this lesson, we dive into isometric illusions and provide feedback on your assignments from the perspective course. We discuss the value of copying existing illusions to learn techniques and emphasize moving beyond copying to experiment with your own creations. You'll learn how to master tools like straightedges and triangles, understanding that precision is key in creating effective illusions.</p>

<p>We highlight the importance of starting with rough sketches to conceptualize your ideas before committing to precise lines. We'll address common challenges, such as maintaining consistency in line angles and proportions, and share insights on how to overcome them. The lesson also explores how "cheating" or manipulating perspectives is a legitimate approach in crafting optical illusions.</p>

<p>Finally, we discuss how working on these illusions enhances your ability to perceive and manipulate space, preparing you for more advanced topics like orthographics and plan projections.</p>
