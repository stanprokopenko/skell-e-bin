<h2>Early Struggles with Airbrush Illustration</h2>

<p>At 18, my first attempt at airbrush, a rose, was a disaster due to water-soluble paints and inexperience. Despite hating the complexity, I persevered. At 19, I tried again with an album cover for my brother's band. After initial failure and near despair, I told myself, **"I can do it again." ** I succeeded, creating a piece I was proud of. This taught me the value of perseverance.</p>

<h2>Learning from Others</h2>

<p>Later, a friend needed an album cover featuring molten gold lettering. My studio buddy, John Dickinson, and I spent a week figuring out how to make gold look like gold. John discovered that <strong>reflections were key.</strong> Together, we achieved it. Collaborating with someone smarter highlighted the importance of learning from others.</p>

<h2>Breaking into the Industry</h2>

<p>In my 20s, I improved with airbrush and created portfolio pieces showcasing my skills. Clients began hiring me for technical illustrations of machines. Doing good work led to more opportunities. I became known as the <strong>illustrator/photo retoucher</strong> of machines.</p>

<h2>Diversifying Skills and Styles</h2>

<p>Art director <strong>Bonnie Toth</strong> gave me a significant break. When her regular illustrators were unavailable, she hired me for a complex oxygenator illustration. She was pleased and began assigning me various styles. She once asked if I could emulate an <strong>Old Master style.</strong> I was thrilled and produced samples inspired by da Vinci. The agency loved it, expanding my range and opportunities.</p>

<h2>Adapting to Technological Changes</h2>

<p>After completing an airbrush project, I saw Photoshop in action. The ability to create perfect gradations digitally was revolutionary. I soon transitioned to <strong>digital illustration</strong>, investing in a powerful computer. Photoshop allowed total control and new creative possibilities. Despite the initial cost, embracing digital was essential to stay relevant.</p>

<h2>The Unchanging Importance of Deadlines</h2>

<p>Regardless of tools, <strong>deadlines remained critical.</strong> Clients expected timely delivery and high standards. Missing deadlines could be costly and damage reputations. Some projects were grueling, affecting my health. Out of over 750 jobs, a few were so demanding the injuries lingered long after the money was gone.</p>

<h2>Reflections on a Changing Landscape</h2>

<p>The industry shifted from a few high-paying clients to many clients paying less. Whether working for clients or fans, expectations didn't change. Meeting deadlines and delivering quality work were essential.</p>

<p>Despite technological advances, <strong>core principles endure</strong>: perseverance, continuous learning, and adapting to new challenges. While tools evolve, the dedication required to succeed as an illustrator remains the same.</p>
