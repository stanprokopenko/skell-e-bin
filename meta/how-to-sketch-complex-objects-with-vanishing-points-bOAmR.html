<h2>Setting Up the Grid</h2>

<p>I'm going to make the anvil float by using an <strong>up view</strong> in <strong>three-point perspective</strong>. I start with a grid where lines going away to the right vanishing point <strong>go down</strong>, and lines to the left vanishing point also <strong>go down</strong>. The vertical lines are slightly angled due to the third vanishing point placed high above. This setup creates the illusion that we're looking <strong>up</strong> at the anvil.</p>

<h2>Establishing Vanishing Points</h2>

<p>To create a mild three-point perspective, I placed the third vanishing point way up on my coffee table. This allows the lines going away to the vanishing points to <strong>go slightly up</strong>, giving depth to the drawing. By adjusting the position of the third point, we control the degree of the up view.</p>

<h2>Constructing the Box</h2>

<p>I begin by building a box for the anvil using the grid lines:</p>

<ul>

<li>I decide on the proportion of the front face.</li>

<li>I run lines back to the vanishing points to establish depth.</li>

<li>I find the centers of the side planes using diagonals.</li>

</ul>

<p>This helps me locate the <strong>center coronal section</strong>, the halfway point from front to back and top to bottom.</p>

<h2>Finding Key Proportions</h2>

<p>Focusing on the <strong>transverse section</strong>, I:</p>

<ul>

<li>Determine it's slightly above halfway up the box.</li>

<li>Use the center lines to establish a square in perspective.</li>

<li>Estimate the square by eye, knowing practice improves accuracy.</li>

</ul>

<p>This square represents the waist of the anvil and is crucial for the overall proportions.</p>

<h2>Drawing the Base</h2>

<p>To draw the base:</p>

<ul>

<li>I find the halfway point of the front face.</li>

<li>Place the front foot slightly in front of this line.</li>

<li>Position the back foot appropriately to maintain credible proportions.</li>

</ul>

<p>Using the grid, I ensure the spacing and sizes of the feet are accurate. The rectangle formed by the feet should be <strong>deeper than it is wide</strong>, matching the anvil's proportions.</p>

<h2>Adding the Feet</h2>

<p>I draw the feet by:</p>

<ul>

<li>Connecting the corners to create the base rectangle.</li>

<li>Ensuring the other feet are slightly in front of the halfway line.</li>

<li>Checking placement with grid lines to maintain accuracy.</li>

</ul>

<p>This step brings solidity to the anvil's base and grounds it within the perspective grid.</p>

<h2>Shaping the Horn</h2>

<p>To draw the horn:</p>

<ul>

<li>I find the center top of the box.</li>

<li>Mark where the horn touches, starting below the top face.</li>

<li>Use a center line and consider the horn as a series of <strong>ellipses</strong> to capture its roundness.</li>

</ul>

<p>I draw cross-contour lines to define the form and ensure the widest part of the horn aligns with the anvil's body.</p>

<h2>Final Touches</h2>

<p>I refine the curves and planes:</p>

<ul>

<li>Emphasize key contours and clean up extra lines.</li>

<li>Ensure all lines follow the grid and perspective rules.</li>

<li>Add cross-contour lines to enhance the three-dimensional form.</li>

</ul>

<p>By understanding the planes and using the grid, I make the anvil appear credible and three-dimensional. This method, while complex, becomes intuitive with practice and helps in drawing objects convincingly in perspective.</p>
