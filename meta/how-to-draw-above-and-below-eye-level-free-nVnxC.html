<h2>What's in Premium?</h2>

<p>In this lesson, you'll learn how to draw objects from above and below using perspective techniques. We'll cover how to set your <strong>eye level</strong> (the <strong>horizon line</strong>) and how it influences all other lines in your drawing. You'll understand how receding lines behave when looking up or down:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Looking down</strong>, receding lines <strong>aim up</strong>.</li>

<li><strong>Looking up</strong>, receding lines <strong>aim down</strong>.</li>

</ul>

<p>We'll explore <strong>one-point</strong>, <strong>two-point</strong>, and <strong>three-point perspective</strong>, focusing on how lines converge toward vanishing points and how vertical lines behave. The importance of the <strong>three spatial axes</strong>—width, height, and depth—will be emphasized to help you accurately depict forms.</p>

<p>You'll learn about <strong>foreshortening</strong> and how angles change as objects approach your eye level. Through practice exercises, such as drawing rooms from different eye levels and quick sketching, you'll reinforce these concepts.</p>

<p>By the end of the lesson, you'll have a solid understanding of perspective drawing from various viewpoints and how to apply these principles to create realistic scenes.</p>
