<p>Greg shared an amazing quote on Twitter today: <strong>"The most unstoppable person on the planet right now is someone who knows how to create videos that the algorithm loves and someone who knows the new LLM tools like Claude v0 and Cursor."</strong> This resonates with me because I've become a <strong>creator composer</strong> over the last four years.</p>

<h2>The Creator Composer Concept</h2>

<p>I've been creating content mainly on TikTok and Instagram, where I almost have 1 million followers. I've gotten good at explaining my ideas across platforms. But composing isn't just about content creation, it's about using language to instruct AI tools. The most important language to learn is <strong>English</strong> to create apps.</p>

<h2>Leveraging AI Tools</h2>

<p>I've been using a stack of tools: <strong>v0</strong>, <strong>Cursor</strong>, <strong>Replit</strong>, and <strong>Firebase</strong>.</p>

<h3>v0</h3>

<p>I use v0 to design sites. By typing in English, it designs the site for me, just like that.</p>

<h3>Cursor</h3>

<p>Cursor allows me to generate and edit many code files in one prompt using its <strong>Composer</strong> feature. It's the best software feature I've ever used.</p>

<h3>Replit</h3>

<p>After generating the code, I use Replit to <strong>deploy</strong> it. Deploying is harder than it looks, but Replit makes it easier. It's like putting your app on the web.</p>

<h3>Firebase</h3>

<p>Every app needs a database. I use Firebase to store data like text posts and photos, just like how Twitter stores tweets and images.</p>

<h2>Building and Deploying Apps Quickly</h2>

<p>These tools make it easier than ever to go from an idea to a deployed app. Four months ago, I didn't know how to do this. But now, with these tools, it's possible to build full apps quickly. We've even created a free template that over 6,000 people have used to build an app.</p>

<h2>The Importance of Storytelling</h2>

<p>Many people can write software, but not all can get users. That's because <strong>storytelling</strong> is crucial. Software is becoming so easy and fun to make that it's becoming an extension of your content.</p>

<h2>Learning in Public</h2>

<p>I'm trying a new strategy called <strong>learn in public</strong>. It's about picking something new to learn, sharing your progress, and creating content about it. If you're exploring new possibilities, you'll be more valuable because others haven't caught up yet.</p>

<h2>Our First App: VoicePower</h2>

<p>We're building an app called <strong>VoicePower</strong>. It uses voice to extract ideas and turn them into good content. It prompts you with ideas, helps you get your thoughts out, and structures them into something polished and consistent.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p>I'll be diving into these tools in future videos, showing you how to create apps and build an audience by sharing your story. I believe this economy is going to be dominated by the <strong>creator composer</strong>. This is vlog number one, and I hope you'll join me on this journey.</p>
