<h2>Materials I’m Using</h2>

<ul>

<li>Strathmore 500 paper  </li>

<li>Conte 2B stick, assorted charcoal pencils/sticks  </li>

<li>Kneaded eraser (dirty is fine) and a firm plastic eraser  </li>

<li>Blending stump, sanding pad, soft brush  </li>

<li>Fingers or a paper towel for scrubbing  </li>

</ul>

<p>Use whatever brand you like, the ideas stay the same.</p>

<h2>Two Pillars: Gesture + Structure</h2>

<p>I think of every figure as a duet of <strong>energy (gesture)</strong> and <strong>mass (structure)</strong>.  </p>

<ul>

<li>Gesture = the <strong>long-axis curve</strong> that runs through a part and links it to the next part. It’s watery, alive, always moving.  </li>

<li>Structure = the form’s <strong>volume</strong> and <strong>planar turns</strong>. It shows how light and shadow travel <strong>over</strong> the surface.  </li>

</ul>

<p>Curves flow, corners break. Everything I do, in line or tone, is just a dance between those two shapes.</p>

<h2>Construction: Lines First</h2>

<ol>

<li><strong>Start flat.</strong> Block a clear 2-D silhouette for head, rib cage, waist, and hips.  </li>

<li>**Add volume. ** Wrap simple tubes, boxes, or eggs around those shapes. Draw one side, the other side, then the end, that end tells the viewer it’s 3-D.</li>

<li><strong>Ride the long axis.</strong> Let a single S-curve run from rib cage into waist, then into hips. Stack each form end-to-end so every structure <strong>begins</strong> the next gesture.  </li>

<li>**Use curves and corners. ** A curve means forms flow, a corner means they stop and a new gesture begins. Straight edges are OK, but too many make the pose wooden.</li>

</ol>

<h2>Shading: Tones on Top</h2>

<p>I shade with the same logic I draw.  </p>

<ol>

<li><strong>Find the core shadow.</strong> Draw it right on the long-axis curve. That line is both gesture <strong>and</strong> the corner where light turns to shadow.  </li>

<li><strong>Fill the shadow.</strong> Scrub pigment from the core into the body of the shadow. Squint: shadow must stay darker than every halftone.  </li>

<li><strong>Gradate over the form.</strong> Zig-zag strokes soften the edge and roll the form. Blend <strong>side-to-side</strong>, then <strong>top-to-bottom</strong> if the light drops off.  </li>

<li><strong>Cast shadows = hard corners.</strong> Where one form abruptly interrupts another, lay a firm edge and drop the value.  </li>

<li><strong>Highlights and reflected light.</strong> Pull with a hard eraser at the hottest spot, then let it soften naturally into the halftone.  </li>

</ol>

<p>Shadow shows the <strong>corner</strong>, gradation shows the <strong>curve</strong>. Same story, different tool.</p>

<h2>Working Order</h2>

<ol>

<li>Big gesture and big structure.  </li>

<li>Broad shadow shapes and main gradations.  </li>

<li>Secondary forms (ribs, shoulder blade, small muscles). Change their spacing, size, and rhythm so nothing repeats mechanically.  </li>

<li>Final accents, sharp edges where you need snap, lost edges where you need calm.</li>

</ol>

<p>At any point I can erase, push darker or even move a line. Wrong lines often add motion, so I leave some in, multiple spines feel like time-lapse action.</p>

<h2>Simplify, Then Refine</h2>

<p>When in doubt, I drop detail and keep the big egg. I only add smaller structures <strong>after</strong> the main gesture reads. Enough structure to find the next gesture, that's the rule.</p>

<h2>Mindset</h2>

<p>I’m not chasing engineering diagrams, I’m composing connections. Line, tone, anatomy, even “mistakes” are just ways to bind parts into a greater whole. Keep squinting, keep curves alive and let corners signal new ideas. Everything else is style.</p>
