<p><strong>Environmental Conditions and Painting</strong></p>

<p>It's really hot where I am, even at 9:00 at night, it's still around 90 degrees. The heat seems to have burned off the moisture, even though it's dark outside. I always test my work to ensure it's not going to move, using a fixative. This is crucial for stability in my paintings.</p>

<p><strong>Tools and Materials</strong></p>

<p>I use a gray-toned board to help in assessing mixtures accurately. A white or warm-toned board would make it difficult to judge mixtures. For beginners, I recommend using neutral gray toning to see colors against a neutral background. Testing mixtures on a gray palette ensures no surprises in color appearance.</p>

<p><strong>Painting Techniques</strong></p>

<p>I test by mixing lighter lights to establish contrasts quickly. Highlights on the head and nose are important for contrast. I like the average color and find it easy to lighten. I protect my mixtures to avoid accidentally mixing them into something else. I use a mixture of camp saw and orchid walnut oil, which lasts for a day or two. A rubber lid helps prevent the mixture from drying out.</p>

<p><strong>Paint Thickness and Texture</strong></p>

<p>It's important to keep dark areas thinner in oil painting. Thicker lights in lighter areas create interesting texture contrasts. Thick and thin paint is a tool in the painting toolbox. I avoid making dark areas thick to prevent unwanted highlights. Thick paint in dark areas can create ridges that catch light, altering perceived value. Shadows should feel airy and transparent, not opaque or plastic-like. Thick shadows can make a painting feel less realistic.</p>

<p><strong>Focus and Detail Work</strong></p>

<p>I focus on the eye of the painting, ensuring color and shape accuracy. Using the right brush size is crucial for detail work. I switch to a smaller brush for smaller areas to maintain control. Squinting helps me focus on dark shapes.</p>

<p><strong>Personal Experiences and Reflections</strong></p>

<p>Filming alone is a new experience, I'm used to having someone to interact with. I feel less crazy talking to a camera, without feedback. I usually try to make people laugh, but it's different without an audience. Reviewing footage, I noticed I seemed tired, which was disappointing. I was painting late into the night, feeling tired, but still enjoying the process. I worried my tired appearance might affect others' experiences, but I was genuinely having fun. Painting alone, I imagined others were with me. I hoped someone would follow along. My family was away, leaving me alone with the dog and cat, which made me feel a bit isolated.</p>

<p><strong>Past Experiences and Techniques</strong></p>

<p>In art school, I learned to draw from imagination, practicing Loomis heads extensively. This practice became instinctual, but it can interfere with observing a model accurately. I aim to paint specific human variations, not just generic Loomis heads. In the past, as a movie poster illustrator, I often had to create images from imagination without references. The lack of resources like Google made it necessary to rely on basic form knowledge for sketches. I used a dark shadow mix for painting eyes and hair, which was prepared the previous day. I rushed the gesso application on the board, resulting in more texture than preferred.</p>

<p><strong>Observations and Adjustments</strong></p>

<p>The light hitting the model's eye was significant, requiring careful attention to values. I use rags from Costco for painting, discarding them after use. Keeping paint thin initially allows for easier adjustments and layering. The model's dark eyes required a darker paint mix, despite the general lightness of the shadows. Squinting helps determine the relative darkness of features, guiding painting decisions.</p>

<p><strong>Humorous References and Realizations</strong></p>

<p>Richard Schmid's "The Secret Squint" video humorously highlights the importance of squinting in art. The speaker references a video or performance featuring a young individual at the start of their career, possibly available on YouTube. The performance is described as hilarious and involves a "secret square." I realized the time-consuming nature of my work and acknowledged that I had switched to a smaller brush, which contributed to the delay. I decided that a smaller brush is unnecessary unless working on detailed areas like the eyes.</p>
