<h2>What's in Premium?</h2>

<p>In this premium lesson, you'll learn how to reach "render heaven" by understanding the underlying shapes and structures in figure drawing. We'll explore using charcoal as an extension of your hand for fluid and expressive lines. You'll tackle foreshortened poses, focusing on building the figure from the hips and using gesture to add flow. The lesson emphasizes practicing foundational forms, embracing abstraction, and knowing when to refine or finish your drawing.</p>
