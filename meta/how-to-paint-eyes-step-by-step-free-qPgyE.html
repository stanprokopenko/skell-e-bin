<h2>What's in Premium?</h2>

<p>In the full lesson on <strong>Painting Realistic Eyes in Color</strong>, we guide you step-by-step through creating a lifelike rendering of eyes. You'll learn how to start with a solid <strong>lay-in</strong>, focusing on key shapes like the keystone between the eyebrows and the underlying spheres of the eyeballs. We cover essential <strong>eye anatomy</strong> to inform your drawing, such as how the cornea affects the shape of the eyelids.</p>

<p>The lesson walks you through <strong>blocking in eyelashes and eyebrows</strong> as graphic shapes, and organizing your <strong>Photoshop layers</strong> for an efficient workflow. You'll learn to establish <strong>local colors</strong>, separate <strong>lights and shadows</strong>, and create smooth gradients using blending tools.</p>

<p>We dive into adding <strong>highlights and dark accents</strong> to enhance depth and realism, and show you how to refine details to bring your painting to life. Throughout, we emphasize balancing warm and cool tones, hard and soft edges, and building up the painting with careful layering and attention to detail.</p>
