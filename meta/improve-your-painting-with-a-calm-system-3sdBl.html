<p>Painting can be a calming experience, especially when you feel confident about your initial drawing. Starting with a solid foundation allows you to move forward with ease, knowing that any corrections needed are minor. This sets the stage for adding darks and progressing through the painting process.</p>

<h2>Managing Anxiety in Art</h2>

<p>Even with over 40 years of experience, I still feel nervous during demonstrations. Anxiety can stem from various factors, like choosing the wrong model or being mentally unprepared. My mantra in these situations is "draw, Morgan, draw," which helps me focus and overcome problems. Nervousness can lead to unnecessary details, so I remind myself to concentrate on the drawing.</p>

<h2>Importance of a Solid Foundation</h2>

<p>A solid drawing foundation brings a sense of calm. The paint itself isn't scary, but losing control is. Despite the heat in my studio, I feel calm because the system I'm demonstrating is working. This foundation is crucial for reducing stress and ensuring a successful painting process.</p>

<h2>Methodical Painting Process</h2>

<p>Following a methodical system in stages reduces anxiety. Unlike "tightrope painting," which can be stressful, especially for beginners, this approach involves:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Putting in shadows</strong></li>

<li><strong>Adding average light</strong></li>

<li><strong>Premixing colors</strong></li>

</ul>

<p>This methodical approach ensures that I don't move forward until I'm satisfied with each stage, making the process logical and less stressful.</p>

<h2>Technical Aspects of Painting</h2>

<p>Using pre-mixed darks from the previous day is helpful for the current lighting situation. Here are some techniques I use:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Adding alizarin to the ear area</strong> for warmth and drawing more with the paint for accuracy.</li>

<li><strong>Using a number two brush</strong> for precision, feeling like I'm drawing with a pencil.</li>

<li><strong>Switching to a bigger brush</strong> for areas like chunky hair, allowing for quicker coverage.</li>

</ul>

<p>I use rare mongoose brushes, which are illegal now, joking about potential trouble with the law. Squinting helps me decide what details to omit, making painting less of a burden. Painting can be challenging, especially with tight deadlines, but squinting aids in decision-making.</p>

<h2>Personal Reflections and Teaching</h2>

<p>I enjoy watching Ethan Becker videos for his humorous approach, though I'm not a social media star. I spent most of my day preparing for this session, starting late at night. I used to paint directly from a blank canvas for demos, but it wasn't useful for teaching. The current method is more beneficial for students, breaking down the process into manageable stages.</p>

<h2>Challenges and Adjustments</h2>

<p>The photo chosen has many details, making it challenging for a beginner head painting course. I decide to focus on the head, leaving other details for later, and begin cleaning the painting to see the effect. I accidentally started painting the hat, but I return to focusing on the darks. I use a mongoose brush out of necessity, noting its floppiness compared to my usual brushes.</p>

<p>My teacher used to say, "If you're having fun, you're doing it wrong," emphasizing the effort required for quality work. Serious effort in drawing often means not having a big smile, but it shows in the quality of the work. I hope viewers find the method simple, as it should be if followed correctly. The method involves setting up the painting in stages, ensuring predictability and ease.</p>
