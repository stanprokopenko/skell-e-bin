<p>In this lesson, we'll explore how to inject <strong>motion into structured drawings</strong>. We all know how stiff a drawing can be when there's too much focus on structure. Let's see if we can put some motion into that structure. <strong>Gesture is important</strong>, and so is <strong>structure</strong>. If it's gesture only, it's wobbly. If it's structure only, it's stiff. It's awful when it's stiff.</p>

<h2>Combining Gesture and Structure</h2>

<p>Let's see if we can get that motion into that stiffness by running the <strong>gesture over the forms</strong>, between the forms, and right through those forms to create something magical and alive.</p>

<h2>Overcoming the Fear of Drawing Hands</h2>

<p>On the way, we're going to meet some terror: <strong>the hands</strong>. They can't be avoided. Let's get into it and <strong>draw a hand</strong>. Move its fingers around until you get comfortable with it. Once you get to love something that's been terrifying, it's no longer, obviously, terrifying. So let's do that. Let's bring some love into the hand.</p>

<h2>Embracing Mistakes</h2>

<p>Let's find the <strong>holy grail of art</strong>, which is drawing <strong>without any fear at all</strong>. And with great confidence, we can do this. I'm not afraid to show mistakes, and I'll do a big clanger in this. See if you can see it before it happens. Before I announce it, see if you can find out what that is. And I leave it in. I don't want to be this teacher that only shows the very best. I think that's an error with a lot of instruction. It leaves out what's important, and that's <strong>errors</strong>, how to fix them, how to recognize them, and how to just live with them sometimes as a learning experience.</p>

<h2>Drawing an Impossible Pose</h2>

<p>We'll also do an <strong>impossible pose</strong>. There's lots to do in this one, and I wish you the best of luck with it. So draw along, listen along, rewind if you get lost, start again. The time is your time. Never try to keep up if it's going too fast. Don't be afraid to skip back and forth either. These lessons belong to you. Do what you will to get where you need to go with them.</p>

<h2>Starting the Drawing</h2>

<h3>Ghosting in the Start</h3>

<p>Okay, the pencil is getting shorter, the drawings are getting more fluid. And as I say that, I hit a little bit of grit onto the paper. What you can do is check underneath each sheet. By the way, these newsprint sheets, I usually put, let's say, 25 of them in a bunch, and that way the wood panel that they sit on doesn't show the grain. So you're looking at quite a bunch of sheets there. But sometimes you get grit in between them. So I'm wiping back with the back of my hand, and that gives me a nice little quick <strong>ghosted start</strong> to this.</p>

<h3>Drawing the Egg</h3>

<p>So, finding the broad end of that <strong>egg</strong> and thinking about the <strong>halves</strong> and <strong>quarters</strong>. Now, this is a back view, so a strange thing happens. The bottom of that sacrum equates to the top of the pubic bone on the other side. So what I've marked there is the drop down for the iliac crest.</p>

<h3>Mapping the Landmarks</h3>

<p>Now I put in the shoulders here and connecting them to the side of that sacrum onto the crest, and they're now representing the latissimus. Now coming down to midway down there again, generally to position where the legs would be. We're just coming down from that belt line as usual, and midway down is a fair indication of where we are if we don't see any other structures there.</p>

<h3>Using Curves and Sticks</h3>

<p>I like to go for a <strong>curve</strong> and use <strong>sticks</strong> where things are very structural. I like the fingers and the metacarpals of the fingers. On the palm of our hand, on the flat side, the face of the hand that we always see, both big bones, you can rub your thumb across and feel all the ridges of those bones. They're the <strong>metacarpals</strong>. <strong>Meta</strong> means beyond, and beyond the carpals are those bones.</p>

<h3>Indicating Feminine Features</h3>

<p>I like to put a little bob on the top of the head there just to denote right away that it's a <strong>feminine pose</strong>. A man can have that hairstyle, but that's how I remember what I'm doing, and also a height to the back of the head is always very feminine.</p>

<h2>Keeping the Gesture Alive</h2>

<p>All our osmosis in full flight here. See, I move that arm slightly to one side. Every once in a while, I'll fall a little bit in the remembrance of all these fundamentals and put in too hard a line there to find the second arm position. So <strong>long, light, and loose</strong> was broken there for a second, and so I was very conscious of it and kept those basics under control.</p>

<p>Now I'm going back in again with a softer line each time and a broader line. Another good way to think about drawing is use the broad of the pencil first, like I'm doing here, and use it lightly. It will represent, in a smaller, more microscopic way, a piece of charcoal that is blunt and big. I start a lot of my big drawings with a charcoal piece like that.</p>

<h2>Indicating Muscles and Forms</h2>

<p>There's the bite of the <strong>gluteal band</strong>, so there's a bit of a band in there, and when the weight-bearing hip is compressed by the biceps of the leg, you get that shortening. Now, as we saw before, that's the same almost as sitting down. So you can see how much longer the gluteus becomes when they're not compressed.</p>

<p>The <strong>gluteus maximus</strong> actually attaches to the side of the leg, strangely. And you can see that on a businesswoman in a pencil skirt. You can see that shadow going long down to the side of the leg. That will help you with that if you can't see the leg. You'll understand what that shape is.</p>

<h2>From Gesture to Sketch</h2>

<p>We have basically the <strong>ghost of render</strong> in that drawing, and you would call that, in the traditional sense, a <strong>sketch</strong> rather than a <strong>gestural drawing</strong> because we've sketched in hard lines, indications of tone, all of that stuff. And so it becomes what we normally think of as a sketch.</p>

<h2>Drawing Hands</h2>

<p>When we're doing all these short drawings, we don't have much time for the hands. So let's every once in a while take a moment to <strong>draw a hand</strong>.</p>

<h3>Simplifying the Hand</h3>

<p>You can see here that I'm plotting the dot in the simplest way. It's not coming at us too much. So we can say from the wrist, the carpals, down to the longest finger, it's <strong>half and half to the middle knuckle</strong>. And from there, we can work anything off. I like to get the little finger in because it goes off at such an angle. And you can see the <strong>hypothenar eminence</strong> behind it. Remember, behind.</p>

<p>It's very easy to think of hands as not dimensional if we're not careful, because we're used to, begin with anyway, most of us see comic book art rather than gallery art. And there's been a lot of stuff taken out to expedite drawing lots and lots of characters. So it's very easy to think of the hands as flat.</p>

<h3>Proportions of the Fingers</h3>

<p>I just drew in one little knuckle there, and I want to show this moment of stepping down to the little finger quite sharply from the middle finger, and not so sharply from the other side. And when the fingers are extended like this, I think of them as just <strong>half and half</strong>. Half from the knuckle down to the middle, and then down again. Even though there's three phalanges and they get one-third shorter each time, I think of half and halves at this point. Then you can articulate it as much as you like after that.</p>

<p>So I'll use the <strong>1-2-3 method</strong>. The second finger is a whole phalange longer than the little finger, and then the two fingers next to the longest finger are one fingernail shorter than the middle finger. And those two fingers can vary in sizes. But knowing that <strong>step down quality</strong> of it is really important to find what we need as a rhythm.</p>

<h3>Capturing the Movement</h3>

<p>When you bend the fingers, the little finger will bend a lot quicker and more than the other fingers. And they usually go in a rhythm where one finger bends the most, the next one not so much. It's the way we close our hand, like a flower. So each of these should be less curled than the first one. See that rhythm? How beautiful it is? As I pull these off one at a time.</p>

<h3>Understanding Perspective</h3>

<p>Also, we've got to remember <strong>perspective</strong>. These fingers are in front of each other. When you learn to draw a hand from the front, it's like a baseball mitt, and you might well forget this dimensional quality of them. Comic book artists kind of made us believe that a little bit because they had to. When you're drawing a realistic hand, you really need to know all these drop-downs.</p>

<h3>Playing with Poses</h3>

<p>I can play with this idea of bending those fingers forever and see how much I can do it until it breaks. Can I push it out this far? It's getting close to broken, but I'll give it a go. It feels a little broken to me, a little crushed and crowded in there. But try it, try everything, and see what you get. You'll soon find what the limits are.</p>

<p>So pushing out like that, I'm going to have to make some changes to how it inserts. So there we go, a little example of playing around and understanding how those digits work.</p>

<h3>Overcoming Fear of Hands</h3>

<p>Do a hand every once in a while to get into the flow of not ignoring them for so long that you can no longer remember how they work, or worse still, <strong>fear them</strong>. I went to a student gallery show once, and every single drawing the hands were behind the back or in the pockets. And you'll be surprised how common that is. That's hiding the hands. You don't have to, because once you learn how to do them and learn how to play with them like I just did, you'll learn to <strong>love them</strong>.</p>

<h2>Developing Your Own Style</h2>

<h3>Learning from Others</h3>

<p>I took a Jeff Watts class a while back and was very influenced by the teachers there, especially a younger teacher. He was really fluid. So I'm picking up a little bit of his vibe here. And he was called <strong>Ben Young</strong>. His name suited his actual character. So Ben Young does very <strong>long fluid lines</strong>, and they are just fabulous. So I'm picking a little bit of that up, but I'm very, very careful <strong>not to be a copy of anyone</strong>, not of Ben Young or Frazetta.</p>

<h3>Avoiding Copying</h3>

<p>Jeff Watts is very good at doing exactly the same thing where he'll go in and he'll repaint or redraw Frazetta, for instance, and see how much he picks up and puts in his own subconscious. Always with the caveat that we don't want to end up looking exactly like that. But I was really enjoying that class and seeing the elongated figures and having fun with it.</p>

<p>So I'll jump in there and feel a little bit of that vibe and pick some up and throw some away and go back into my style again. And that's what's great about also hanging out with artists. You're going to pick up something from everyone, and that big stew of taking what you like and throwing what you don't like away is very useful. Just make sure that at the end of the day, you're the boss, and you say, "Do I want to be like this person, or do I want to be like me?" And my answer is very clear: <strong>I want to be like me</strong>.</p>

<h3>Emphasizing Shape Design</h3>

<p>I was really enjoying that class and seeing the elongated figures and having fun with it. So I'll jump in there and feel a little bit of that vibe and pick some up and throw some away and go back into my style again. But it's a wonderful way to get into the mind of another artist and see how that goes.</p>

<p>Shape design is what it is. So if everyone has a <strong>shape design mindset</strong>, then your shapes are going to determine how people see your work and call it <strong>stylish</strong> or <strong>copy</strong>. And so we want to be stylish.</p>

<h3>The Anatomy of Style</h3>

<p>I think my first book, <strong>The Anatomy of Style</strong>, was misrepresented a little bit in that people expected to see weird style, non-realism, abstract to the point of just big slashing marks. But what I really mean by The Anatomy of Style is you learn your anatomy, and you <strong>stylize each line to fit your aesthetic</strong>. I like that boxy knee to be followed by a quick curve. So those kinds of things. It's still, that's what nature is. But the way you lay down every line is the reason why there is style.</p>

<h2>Handling Foreshortening and Impossible Poses</h2>

<h3>Adjusting Proportions in Foreshortened Views</h3>

<p>When you're working on the fly like this, you're going to need a little bit of subconscious art engine guidance to get you back on the straight and narrow, especially if you're going wild like this. What I'm doing here is known as <strong>automatic drawing</strong>. Move your way down from what you know, like from the upper arm, and then add stuff to it. For me, it's the most dangerous way to draw because nearly everything gets out of proportion. I like to have at least some proportional elements, like the torso there, and it makes it easier for me to put that arm in because I know that I can just glance over to the midpoint and know that that's where the elbow is going to swing out from.</p>

<h3>Drawing the Impossible Pose</h3>

<p>This is one of the hardest things actually, coming in for these ghosted views of someone sitting, because remember the gluteus are lower than Mrs. V, and on this occasion here, they're being compressed as well by the floor. Very, very tricky, difficult pose.</p>

<p>I call this the <strong>impossible pose</strong> because we see the front and the back at the same time. But think of how simple you can make it. A <strong>mushroom</strong> is always a good call. This is a female figure, of course, because that's what we're drawing all the way through. And we have some foreshortening on the thigh there as well. So I'm grouping big groups. You see something like this every once in a while, a model will challenge you. I have some fantastic models, and every once in a while, they will do something like this. Of course, it's a gasp from the audience, "I can't draw that!" And that's why it's known as the impossible pose. But we can. Please simplify it.</p>

<h3>Simplifying Complex Poses</h3>

<p>So there's a big mushroom shape, and we can see the crest of the hip there as it transforms into the rib cage at the obliques. We can understand that, right? So we leave it at that. Keep it simple until we understand what the other thing is doing. As long as we have those two shapes the same as basic volumes. And then find out where the shoulders are at this point. We're looking up at the figure in a foreshortened manner, so we're going to see the top of the shoulders.</p>

<p>This is probably the trickiest part: these arms being pulled back away from the body and then coming forward at us. And little Spider-Man hands. So a <strong>carpal ramp</strong> tells a big story.</p>

<h3>Adjusting for Foreshortening</h3>

<p>Now, the impossible is possible because everything in there is fine. Now, the reason I erased there is because, and this is very common, we expect the head to be what it always is, which is a certain dimension. However, when we're foreshortened like this, it's better to <strong>draw the head bigger</strong> because it will look very tiny on a foreshortened pose if we don't. So this is one of the few times where you go, the bigger the head, the better. Usually, the smaller the head is better, it's more majestic. But not on this occasion. You don't want a little pea head.</p>

<p>Even though I've made that head much bigger, it still feels short to me, it feels small. So I am going to keep on adjusting that to make it bigger. If you've done a lot of stuff in the head already and it's too much work and the clock is ticking, just add more hair to it, and the world automatically sees the head as much bigger.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p><strong>Drawing</strong>, there's nothing like it. There's nothing more relaxing than how lucky we are to do it and how really lucky we are if we can make it our life. But it doesn't have to be a profession. The greatest reward is you make it a <strong>lifestyle</strong>. You've always got drawing in your life. And of course, that's where we end up, isn't it? My idea for retirement isn't to continue working but to draw for the pleasure of it.</p>
