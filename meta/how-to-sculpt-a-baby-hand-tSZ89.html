<p>Welcome to this guided demo. In this demo, you'll be sculpting a baby hand.</p>

<h2>Building the Wire Armature</h2>

<p>First, build a wire armature using 12 gauge aluminum wire. Twist two wires together, then do the same with another two wires. Weave them together down the forearm and twist tightly to secure. Add a fifth wire in the middle for the thumb, twisting it tightly up to the wrist. Use pliers with wire cutters to secure the thumb wire.</p>

<h2>Ensuring Baby Proportions</h2>

<p>Ensure the hand has <strong>baby proportions</strong>: fingers spread out, middle finger longest, thumb on the side. Use reference images of baby hands for accuracy.</p>

<h2>Covering the Armature with Clay</h2>

<p>Use a waxy, fairly soft clay. Warm the clay in your hand to soften it. Press pieces of clay onto the armature, focusing on a rounded, oval shape for the forearm. Reference an eight-month-old baby hand for proportions.</p>

<h2>Building Out the Palm and Thumb</h2>

<p>Build out the palm, keeping it wide and thick. Add mass to represent the teardrop-shaped muscle on the pinky side and the thenar eminence on the thumb side. Cover the thumb wire armature with clay, wrapping and pressing it into the surface.</p>

<h2>Shaping the Fingers</h2>

<p>Shape the fingers into a conical form, starting with a claw-like shape. Continue to build out the forms, adding more clay to the forearm. Study the reference images frequently.</p>

<h2>Adding Details and Refining the Sculpture</h2>

<p>Pay attention to where baby fat accumulates, usually between the joints. Add clay to the palm, focusing on the pinky side teardrop shape and the padded area below the fingers. Be thoughtful about where to add clay to best resemble the reference. Take your time, turning the sculpture and comparing it to the reference. Pay attention to creases and transitions between forms. Add clay to soften the back of the hand, ensuring it looks rounded and chubby. Understand the differences between baby hands and older hands. Add fat pads on the front side, separating the fingers. Shape the fingers from the side view. Consider the gesture of the hand; this one is reaching for something. Add clay to the back of the hand, focusing on the fat areas between the knuckles. Smooth things out with tools, cleaning up transitions between pieces of clay. Use a butter knife to round things up and clean creases between fat rolls. Add clay to the tips of the fingers and remove some clay where the fingernails will be. Recognize the subtle presence of fingernails.</p>

<p>Finish the study of the baby's hand. Grab some clay and start sculpting your baby hand sculpture study. Doing the assignments will help you master the techniques discussed. Stay creative and productive.</p>
