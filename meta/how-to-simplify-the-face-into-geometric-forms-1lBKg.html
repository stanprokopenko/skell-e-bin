<p>Welcome to the head drawing and construction course. Today, we'll be talking about a step-by-step approach to understanding the proportions of the face, breaking down the features, and adding some light and shadow.</p>

<h2>Basic Head Structure</h2>

<p>Start with a <strong>basic sphere</strong>. Consider the <strong>tilt</strong>, the <strong>jaw</strong>, and the <strong>chin</strong>. Think about the <strong>orientation of the rotation of the head</strong>. Gesture the <strong>neck</strong>, noting the <strong>pinch and stretch</strong>.</p>

<h2>Proportions</h2>

<p>Mark the <strong>brow line</strong> and find the <strong>center</strong>. Remember the proportions: <strong>halves and thirds</strong>. The <strong>hairline</strong> is at the top third. Mark the <strong>four points</strong> for the sides, creating <strong>quarters</strong>. Place the <strong>ear</strong> in one of these quarters. From there, draw the <strong>jaw to the chin</strong>.</p>

<h2>Feature Placement</h2>

<p>Add the <strong>sockets</strong> and relate them to the <strong>forehead</strong>. Start to think of how the <strong>cheek</strong> might go behind, creating an <strong>overlap</strong> with the brow. Next, add the <strong>keystone</strong>. Draw the <strong>socket line</strong> and find the <strong>nose</strong>. Use the <strong>proportion line</strong> to create a <strong>simple box</strong> for the nose. This can give you the <strong>corner of the eye</strong>. Sometimes, the rhythm of the face can be misleading, so observe carefully.</p>

<p>Add the <strong>denture sphere</strong> for the mouth area.</p>

<h2>Adding Hair</h2>

<p>If you're interested in adding <strong>hair</strong>, think of it as a <strong>hat</strong>. Use <strong>wrapping lines</strong> to bring a shape and connect it around the head. Address it like <strong>Barbie hair</strong>. It is one plastic mold that's rested on top of the head.</p>

<h2>Developing the Features</h2>

<p>Now we'll start to add and play around with some of the features.</p>

<h3>Eyes</h3>

<p>You can start by putting the <strong>pupil and iris</strong> first, then put the <strong>structure of the lid</strong> on top. Observe the <strong>development of the brow ridge</strong>. The inside of the socket may feel more recessed. For the <strong>lower lid</strong>, think of the structure of a box. You can even start to make small observations about the <strong>structure of the fat underneath the eye</strong> and how to transition from a <strong>hard form to a softer form</strong>. Always keep it as simple forms: a <strong>ball</strong>, a <strong>stretched cylinder</strong>, or a <strong>curved box</strong>.</p>

<p>On the other side, you might need to <strong>narrow the keystone</strong> a bit. Look at the <strong>structure of the eye</strong>, the <strong>attachment</strong> that has that box, how it hits the ball of the eye, comes up, and goes across. You might see a little bit of the fat back there, a softer form over that harder form.</p>

<h3>Nose</h3>

<p>For the <strong>nose</strong>, you might pinch the box up because the <strong>nasal saddle</strong> looks to be really narrow and thin. Find the <strong>centerline</strong> of the nose. You don't have to draw it as if it's in profile, but think about the <strong>planes of your box</strong> and adjust them to be larger or more slender as needed. Note how it drops back and comes forward, then down again. This could be the <strong>bell</strong> of the nose.</p>

<p>Each little form is an opportunity to pause and think about one thing at a time, the <strong>structure</strong> and the <strong>perspective</strong>.</p>

<h3>Lips</h3>

<p>For the <strong>lips</strong>, you can start by bringing down the <strong>philtrum shape</strong>. If you're comfortable with the proportion line of your lips, you can bring that down to the denture sphere. Remember the <strong>M and W</strong> shapes, the process is to get the <strong>M and W wrapped across that center line</strong>. The lips here might be really thin, so you adjust accordingly. Echo around, matching the planes with the different turns and contours of the lips.</p>

<h3>Chin and Buccal Fat</h3>

<p>The <strong>chin</strong> might be really broad. You could adjust by lifting it some. Think about the <strong>buccal fat</strong>, surrounding the face.</p>

<h2>Adding Light and Shadow</h2>

<p>Now we've worked through a simple construction development and have a breakdown of the features. We're ready to start adding some <strong>light and shadow</strong>.</p>

<h3>Considering the Edges</h3>

<p>To bridge the linear into the tonal, consider the <strong>edges</strong> when you see the fall of light and shadow on a specific surface.</p>

<ul>

<li>Use <strong>soft edges</strong> for <strong>spheres</strong>.</li>

<li>Use <strong>firm edges</strong> for <strong>cylinders</strong>.</li>

<li>Use <strong>hard edges</strong> for <strong>boxes</strong>.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Form Shadow and Cast Shadow</h3>

<p>When thinking about lighting, consider the <strong>form shadow</strong>, the darkest part of the shadow caused by light hitting the form from a specific angle. Also, look at the <strong>cast shadows</strong>.</p>

<h3>Questions About Lighting</h3>

<p>It's sometimes good to ask questions like:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>What type of light?</strong> Is it sun, candle, or something else?</li>

<li><strong>What's the direction?</strong> Is it coming from the top or bottom?</li>

</ul>

<p>This helps build more story and gesture in your drawing.</p>

<h3>Value Compositions</h3>

<p>In concept art or film, you can reduce lighting down to about five different <strong>value compositions</strong>:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>High key</strong></li>

<li><strong>Low key</strong></li>

<li><strong>High contrast</strong></li>

<li><strong>Mid-range</strong></li>

</ul>

<p>Associating light and its position with one of these value compositions can give you a lot of gesture and storytelling from simple steps.</p>

<h3>Finding the Core Shadow</h3>

<p>When thinking more about the face, focus on the <strong>core shadow</strong>, the part of the shadow that's describing the form and its turn. Look at that in contrast to the areas that are more <strong>cast shadows</strong>. Focus on where the core shadow is and the quality of the <strong>halftone</strong> and <strong>edge</strong> that comes off of that.</p>

<h2>Mapping Edges to Replace Lines</h2>

<p>When you think of lighting, don't try to manufacture a copy of what is in front of you. Think about <strong>timing</strong>, timing the viewer's eye as it tracks across the surface.</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>No lines in nature, just edges.</strong></li>

<li>Replace lines with edges.</li>

<li>Understand the parts of the face as simple forms.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Lighting the Big Forms First</h2>

<p>Always <strong>light the big ideas first</strong>, whether it's the big graphic separation and edges or the forms themselves. Don't get caught up in rendering small details like the pupil and iris before considering the overall lighting.</p>

<h2>Applying Light and Shadow to Features</h2>

<h3>Forehead</h3>

<p>Consider what kind of surface your <strong>forehead</strong> is, a sphere, cylinder, or box. Your first line will track where the difference is between light and shadow. Your <strong>core shadow</strong> wraps the form, so soften it out to create that halftone soft edge you want to read consistently with the sphere.</p>

<h3>Eye Sockets</h3>

<p>For the <strong>sockets</strong>, which are boxes, keep the edges sharper to get that sense of turn. The <strong>keystone</strong> might be more of a cylindrical form, so map the shape accordingly. The cast shadow from the brow creates interesting shapes over the eye.</p>

<h3>Nose</h3>

<p>Think of the <strong>nose</strong> as a cylinder or a box. Replace the line with a softer edge for the cylindrical parts. Observe the core shadow and the plane changes. Use sharp, hard edges for cast shadows, consistent with drawing a box.</p>

<h3>Cheeks</h3>

<p>For the <strong>cheekbone</strong>, it could be a cylinder or a box. Separate light from shadow and give a gradation to the edge. The <strong>malar fat pad</strong> may have a more gradual turn, so provide a slower gradation.</p>

<h3>Mouth and Lips</h3>

<p>For the <strong>lips</strong>, get the form shadow on the top lip. The upper lip might cast a shadow onto the lower lip. The forms as they get smaller won't confuse you because you still know how to read each one, a box, a cylinder, despite the smaller size.</p>

<h3>Chin</h3>

<p>The <strong>chin</strong> might be an egg shape. It gets a core shadow with a nice gradation that takes the viewer's eye from the area of light into the core shadow and then shadow. Notice how it blends with the jowl fat that's dropped.</p>

<h2>Working with Values</h2>

<p>Once you have your forms and shadows mapped, think about the <strong>value composition</strong> of your piece.</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Value 1</strong> is the page.</li>

<li><strong>Value 10</strong> is the intensity of the lighting (your core shadow).</li>

<li>Fill in the shadows to begin at a <strong>value 5</strong>.</li>

</ul>

<p>Fill in an idea of the face or the shadow as a consistent value all the way down. Mapping your edges well will help create a subtle feeling of form or realism.</p>

<h3>Avoiding Outlines</h3>

<p>Lose the edges, you don't want big outlines around your head. This is the idea of the <strong>lost edge</strong> or the <strong>compositional edge</strong>. You might blow out that side of the form because it's starting to compete too much with where you want the <strong>focal point</strong> to be.</p>

<h3>Lost Edges</h3>

<p>When making these drawings, don't feel restricted to the outline. We don't see outlines in nature, only edges. You might lose edges to guide the viewer's eye, and to emphasize certain areas over others.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p>By working through a simple construction and then breaking down the features, you can begin to understand the proportions of the face. Thinking about the features as sculptures set on top of primary forms allows you to add light and shadow effectively. This approach helps build a backbone and scaffolding to the way you think about your light and shadow.</p>
