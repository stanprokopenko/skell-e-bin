<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>When the arms hang down, the shoulder blades relax and settle into place. Sometimes they're visible, and other times you need to <strong>impose</strong> them a bit. My key rule is, <strong>When in doubt, simplify. ** I map the shoulders using </strong>corners<strong> or </strong>curves<strong> and, as my understanding grows, I add more </strong>secondary forms**, whether flattened 2D shapes or basic 3D forms that appear and disappear depending on the pose.</p>

<h2>Basic Shoulder Structure</h2>

<p>The shoulders sit on <strong>top of the rib cage</strong>, and I like to think of a line that marks where the torso ends and the arm begins. Sometimes I see that as a corner, even if it gets rounded. This line adjusts when the arm lifts. The <strong>deltoid</strong> can often be drawn as an <strong>egg</strong> attached at the top of the arm.</p>

<h3>Deltoid as an Egg</h3>

<p>• I imagine an egg or rounded shape sitting at the <strong>shoulder line</strong>.<br />

• From a side or three-quarter view, that egg shape represents the deltoid, even if it’s mostly hidden.<br />

• It often bumps outward at the top of the arm, similar to how the shoulder blade bumps on the back.</p>

<h2>Movement and Articulation</h2>

<p>When the arm raises, it <strong>lifts the shoulder line</strong> and influences the shoulder blade’s placement and angle. As the arm moves back, the shoulder blade edges closer to the spine. When the arm pivots forward or upward, the shoulder blade shifts away from the spine.</p>

<h3>Upside-Down L Concept</h3>

<p>I often imagine the <strong>shoulder blade</strong> in a simplified upside-down L or right-angled shape. Even if the lines are gently curved, I keep that right angle in mind and use it to block in its basic direction. The more you lift the arm, the farther the blade can swing around the rib cage, until it reaches its limit, at which point it can’t pivot much more.</p>

<h2>Shoulder-Shoulder Blade Unit</h2>

<p>This <strong>unit</strong> sits on top of the rib cage and should feel like it can move independently. If I treat the shoulder and torso as a single fused shape, the figure looks immobile. By drawing a <strong>pinch</strong> or <strong>overlap</strong> where the arm meets the torso, I show that these parts can articulate.</p>

<h3>Three-Sided Approach</h3>

<p>I often draw just <strong>three sides</strong> of the deltoid or shoulder blade shape, enough to define it without flattening everything. I might,

1. Mark the top edge where the shoulder line is.<br />

2. Show a corner or egg form for the deltoid.<br />

3. Suggest where it connects to the arm and torso, using overlap or a “pinch” line.</p>

<h2>Simplifying the Pose</h2>

<p>If you find these movements tricky, revert to <strong>simpler poses</strong> with arms down. Once you’re comfortable, move on to more <strong>articulated</strong> poses. Meanwhile, keep feeling out that corner or curve where the shoulder meets the torso.</p>

<h2>Example Drawing Process</h2>

<p>I’ll start by sketching the <strong>spine</strong> and the <strong>tube</strong> of the torso, giving it basic bulges for the rib cage. Then:

1. I mark the <strong>shoulder line</strong> across the top of the rib cage.<br />

2. I add a <strong>pinch</strong> or small corner to show where the torso ends and the arm begins.<br />

3. I place the <strong>egg</strong> shape for the deltoid (only three sides if I want it quick and clear).<br />

4. If the arm is raised, I shift the shoulder line upward and adjust the shoulder blade, staying aware of where it might angle or overlap.</p>

<h2>Front and Back Corners</h2>

<p>From behind, the shoulder blades sit on the <strong>corners</strong> of the back. I think in terms of:

• Mid-back area as the “darkest part” or <strong>center</strong>.<br />

• The shoulder blades resting on those <strong>outer corners</strong>.<br />

• The side of the torso curving around into those corners.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p>The <strong>shoulder-shoulder blade unit</strong> rests on top of the rib cage. By simplifying into corners, curves, and egg shapes, I can track the shoulder’s articulation and maintain a natural sense of movement. The entire arm feels like it’s able to lift, rotate, and relax properly. And, as always, <strong>when in doubt, simplify</strong> to keep it clear and flexible.</p>
