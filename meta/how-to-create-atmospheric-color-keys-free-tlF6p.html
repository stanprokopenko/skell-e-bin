<h2>What's in Premium?</h2>

<p>In this lesson, you'll learn how to refine a smoky exterior <strong>color key</strong> for a digital painting. We'll cover setting up your scene with line art on a multiply layer, choosing base colors manually to create a misty, moody atmosphere, and building the background with gradients and glow effects.</p>

<p>You'll discover how to add depth and atmosphere by layering elements, applying <strong>soft shadows</strong> and <strong>ambient occlusion</strong>, and incorporating reflections. We'll also focus on enhancing your character with rim light and adjusting contrast to draw the viewer's eye. Finally, we'll discuss framing the composition and evaluating the scene without line art for a photographically believable look.</p>
