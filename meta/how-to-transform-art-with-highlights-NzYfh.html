<h2>Preparing for the Lighting Stage</h2>

<p>Okay, so next I'm moving on to the lighting stage of my coloring process, where I'll focus on adding light and highlights. To start, I like to organize my layers. I have a group with all my <strong>flats</strong> and another group with all my <strong>shading</strong>. Then, I'll create a new layer above everything for my highlights.</p>

<h2>The Transformative Power of Highlights</h2>

<p>Highlights can be the most transformative part of the process. While shadows are functional, highlights add <strong>style</strong> and can significantly affect the overall <strong>color palette</strong>. By introducing a new highlight color, often complementary to the existing colors, I can create a big impact on the piece.</p>

<h2>Choosing the Highlight Color</h2>

<p>I'm thinking that our highlight needs to be brighter than what's currently on the canvas. I'll color select the existing lightest color and <strong>amp it up</strong>. The difference might be minor, but for this piece, a subtle change might be just what I want.</p>

<h2>Deciding How Much to Highlight</h2>

<p>A question I sometimes get is, "How much should be highlighted versus shadowed?" It really depends on the piece. It hinges on the <strong>quality of the light source</strong>, and how much you want the light to be featured compared to the natural colors of your flats. If we decide to <strong>amp up</strong> the highlights, we can make the highlight color stand out much more, almost making it the central focus of the piece.</p>

<h2>Adjusting the Lighting Scheme</h2>

<p>Let's say we decide to intensify the lighting scheme. Maybe we go with another overlay that's not dark enough, or we <strong>saturate</strong> the colors more. Perhaps it's blue, giving it an afternoon feel. This is one of those adjustment layers where you might feel the piece could be anything at this stage. It's essential to stay true to your vision of the feeling it should evoke because here's where you can get trapped in what I call <strong>hue saturation hell</strong>. You might get stuck here indefinitely, so be aware.</p>

<h2>Experimenting with Color and Mood</h2>

<p>For example's sake, let's go with something really different, like moving from cool to warm tones. If I decide on a warm afternoon vibe, I might choose a radical highlight color, like a warm pink. This might require tweaking the highlight color to find just the right shade.</p>

<p>If we go with something like this, where we're adding a really intense highlight color, it's adding most of the <strong>personality</strong> to the piece. It's the artist pressing on the scale of rendering what makes sense versus being more playful and <strong>making a statement</strong>.</p>

<h2>Balancing Highlights and Shadows</h2>

<p>Functionally, I'm still placing the highlights in the same areas as before, but stylistically, the highlight color is doing much more than just adding information. It's determining the <strong>point of view</strong> of the piece.</p>

<p>I saw a talk by a famous Marvel artist who characterized highlights as <strong>"crack"</strong>, you just want a little bit. He referred to putting a little bit of white on the eyes, to make them pop. I agree, if you overdo it, it starts to lose its impact. Maybe you're getting a sense of what I mean, the highlight is really loud and determining the vibe of the piece.</p>

<h2>Adjusting the Background to Match</h2>

<p>Right now, things might not be in alignment because my sky is a different color. If I change it to something warm and afternoon-like, it can help <strong>motivate</strong> that pink highlight. The piece now feels completely different, maybe like it's the end of an episode where former enemies have made a truce and are now allies. This feels very different, and perhaps I'll leave it like this.</p>

<h2>The Importance of Experimentation</h2>

<p>It's fun to play with these things, even when I have a strong idea, because experimenting and trying out different things is where I <strong>grow the most</strong>. Sometimes I fall into a comfort zone of doing the same old, same old, and figuring out new things is where I get ideas. Playing with new techniques, mediums, or styles is where you get ideas that you can take or leave, but sometimes you add a little bit to your skill set, and that's what makes it useful.</p>

<h2>Enhancing Surfaces with Highlights</h2>

<p>The highlight here is bringing any glass surfaces to life. Where before it was very flat-looking and not reflective at all, now I can add that highlight and get a lot of mileage. I'm trying to make these little shimmers go in the same direction as if they're reflecting back the same light. Sometimes I do too much, though, and I have to remember when to <strong>dial it in</strong>.</p>

<h2>Avoiding Overused Color Schemes</h2>

<p>One reason I'm leaning towards this color scheme is that I've actually done a lot of pieces with <strong>teal</strong>, I just really like teal. But the last time I put a portfolio together of sorts, I realized a bunch of them were all teal and kind of the same. So maybe doing something like this is a good way for me to experiment.</p>

<h2>Using Highlights to Guide the Viewer</h2>

<p>Where a lot of details were previously lost in the amount of detail and linework I put in, this highlight is helping me decide one more time what I want you to really <strong>focus on</strong>. Because it's the loudest element, it's kind of the most important in terms of visual loudness.</p>

<p>I can think about highlighting areas in ways that <strong>move your eye</strong> around to what I want you to see, and that's a choice I'll prioritize. Lighting an awning in a way that steers you to the character, for example, is a good thing. It could potentially be too intense, but that's the sort of influence I want my linework to have, to enhance your ability to look at what I think the story is or to understand what the story is.</p>

<h2>Using Clipping Masks to Adjust Highlights</h2>

<p>Similarly, I can use a <strong>clipping mask</strong> on the highlight layer to tweak it so that the highlight isn't as loud everywhere. For instance, on the ground, the highlight might not need to be as intense as on the main character. I can adjust this by adding a <strong>darker value</strong> to soften where the highlight might be a little too intense.</p>

<h2>Re-Adjusting Earlier Layers</h2>

<p>At this point, I've done a pass of the highlight, and it's pretty intense, changing the piece quite a bit. Now, I can go back and readjust earlier layers. These were balanced for when it was a brighter, earlier-in-the-day scheme. If I'm leaning towards one way or the other, now is the time to decide whether to go back to the previous version or fix these adjustments to suit the new lighting scheme.</p>

<h2>Adding Soft Glows and Texture</h2>

<p>I might add some <strong>soft glows</strong> to help achieve the more intense lighting scheme. I do this by creating a new layer on top, using a <strong>grain brush</strong> to add texture. I'm particular to a little bit of grain, it's a very common effect that just happens to look nice.</p>

<p>Using a <strong>soft light</strong> blending mode, I can add a glow that simulates <strong>atmospheric diffusion</strong>, like when light goes through a window, and you can see the path of the light because it's a bit dusty. That's the effect I'm going for with this grain, having it trail off in a glow, to expand the influence of our light source and highlights.</p>

<h2>Reflecting Light on Surfaces</h2>

<p>On the lower side of the image, we might not have any place to have a direct highlight in a way that makes sense because it's a flat surface. In this case, I imagine that the bright light hitting the ground might <strong>reflect back</strong> in a large way, allowing me to control what I want the color to be in that area.</p>

<h2>Adjusting and Refining Effects</h2>

<p>As I progress, I'm always wary of <strong>overdoing</strong> effects like soft glows. Knowing when to dial it back or potentially taking a break and reevaluating is essential. Sometimes I need to erase certain areas so that I don't cover up the shadow work I did previously.</p>

<p>There's always a temptation when adding soft glows, they usually look cool going on, but it's harder to reign them in and know where to keep them so that they're most effective, rather than blowing everything out. I like how the grain on the sidewalk feels correct, and I'm thinking the base color for the highlight could be even more bold.</p>

<h2>Tweaking the Color Scheme</h2>

<p>I'm going to <strong>amp up</strong> the saturation and blend it more by adjusting the layers. I think the scheme being <strong>blues, pinks, and oranges</strong> is a palette I haven't done as often, and that might be where I want to go. Being conscious of the colors I'm working with and knowing to play into them helps me stay on track.</p>

<h2>Adjusting Shadows to Match the Highlights</h2>

<p>Now that I'm leaning into this color scheme, I might go back to my <strong>shadow layer</strong>, which was meant for the daytime vibe, and change its color. Sometimes, when I turn off the shadow layer altogether, I realize I might not even need it, the highlight layer might be doing enough.</p>

<p>Before I give up on it, I'll mess around with it to see if I like it with different settings. Adjusting the shadow color to <strong>blues or purples</strong> makes it more subtle, which is kind of nice. It's not fighting the background as much, making it a bit more cohesive.</p>

<h2>Balancing and Softening Shadows</h2>

<p>I might decide to keep some shadow information, so I'll find a good medium by brightening the shadows slightly. Then, I'll use a clipping mask to <strong>soften</strong> the edges of the shadows. By adjusting the colors and blending them more into the highlights, I get some of what I wanted from both the shadow and highlight layers.</p>

<h2>Final Adjustments and Testing</h2>

<p>Towards the end, my layers turn into a <strong>mess of adjustments</strong>, effect after effect. At this stage, I want to keep these elements isolated, so I can take them out if I decide I'm not feeling them anymore. I'll test everything and see if I can lose anything. Sometimes, I made a layer, and end up liking the piece better without it.</p>

<p>I'll also adjust the <strong>cloud layer</strong> to add a little bit of interest. I can <strong>alpha lock</strong> it and try coloring on top of it to see what happens. I might adjust its color to fit the overall tone better.</p>

<h2>Softening Edges with Blur</h2>

<p>I haven't used the <strong>blur tool</strong> much, but sometimes I'll use it to soften edges, like where the form shadow turns away. For instance, if I didn't fill in a highlight completely, I can blur it in instead of grabbing the color and fixing it manually.</p>

<h2>Moving to Finishing Touches</h2>

<p>That's my lighting pass at this drawing. I'm going to be moving on to the <strong>final step</strong> for me, which is the finishing touches. For me, this is when I'm comfortable with drawing on top of everything and start to color within the <strong>line art</strong> of my work. I reserve this for the end because coloring on that line is really saying that it's in relationship to the colors that are more set and finalized. If I do that earlier, it means I'll be fighting against any changes I make below, so that's why it's part of the finishing touches.</p>
