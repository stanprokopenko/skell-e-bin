<p>In this project, I'll be working on designing value groups using a beautiful cast from a photo so you can follow along. We'll be combining concepts we've learned so far and adding another layer on top.</p>

<h2>Starting the Drawing</h2>

<p>I'm using graphite for this drawing, which takes longer to fill in, so bear with me as I go through the process. When shading something, we still need to get the <strong>proportions</strong> right. It's important to think about <strong>proportions</strong>, <strong>gesture</strong>, <strong>rhythms</strong>, <strong>shape design</strong>, <strong>form</strong>, <strong>structure</strong>, <strong>values</strong>, and <strong>composition</strong>. All these elements come into play in this drawing.</p>

<h2>Mapping the Proportions</h2>

<p>I begin by <strong>mapping</strong> things in to get the proportions down. Initially, I made the drawing too big, so I adjusted by taking measurements. For example, I measured the width of the beard and related it to other parts of the face, making sure everything fits on the page. It's crucial to choose a <strong>ground truth</strong>, a measurement that you know is correct, and build from there. For me, the distance from the top of the head to the bottom of the nose served as a reliable reference.</p>

<p>As I work, I make sure the <strong>large shapes</strong> are accurate before moving on to smaller details. Starting with simple shapes makes it easier to judge proportions and make adjustments. If something feels wrong, it's wrong, so I don't hesitate to move things around.</p>

<h2>Defining Rhythms and Shapes</h2>

<p>I pay attention to the <strong>rhythms</strong> throughout the face, the flow of the beard, how angles connect, and how shapes relate to each other. I'm looking for major angles, and big sweeping lines that create simple shapes. By connecting points and angles, I ensure the drawing has a natural flow. I'm simplifying complex forms into <strong>straights and corners</strong>, which emphasizes the structural feel of the sculpture.</p>

<p>Even with straight lines, I can create the sense of curves through a series of connected angles. This approach helps maintain the <strong>masculine</strong>, structural quality of the subject, avoiding a fluid or melting appearance.</p>

<h2>Simplifying and Shadow Mapping</h2>

<p>Before adding details, I define the <strong>cheekbone rhythm</strong>, separating the front and side planes of the face. This is an important part of viewing the head as a <strong>box</strong>, which helps in understanding the structure. I use <strong>shadow mapping</strong> by outlining all the shadows, planning to fill them in later. This involves simplifying shadows into clear, straightforward shapes.</p>

<p><strong>Squinting</strong> helps me see the big shapes and simplify them. In the beginning, squinting is extremely important, it helps merge details into larger shapes and identifies the main shadows and lights. As I progress, I'll open my eyes more, and focus on subtleties.</p>

<h2>Establishing Values</h2>

<p>I switch to a darker pencil to fill in the shadow shapes. I start from the top left to avoid smudging the drawing as I work across the page. At this stage, I'm working with two values: the light (the white of the paper) and the shadow. I'm simplifying areas and eliminating unnecessary details to focus on the larger forms.</p>

<p>I fill in the <strong>shadow shapes</strong> uniformly, "blowing through" smaller light areas within them. I'll revisit those later with an eraser if needed. Right now, the goal is to establish a clear separation between light and shadow.</p>

<h2>Using Tools for Tones and Edges</h2>

<p>I use a <strong>blending stump</strong> to soften textures and create consistent values. Once I have a base layer, I introduce <strong>charcoal powder</strong> to create large areas of tone, especially in the background. It helps create soft edges, and it speeds up the process. It's like applying foundation, smooth and even. Be cautious with charcoal and graphite together, because they reflect light differently, which can be distracting in the final drawing.</p>

<p>I also use brushes to manipulate the charcoal powder, achieving smooth transitions and softening edges. With practice, this technique becomes a powerful way to control large areas without visible strokes.</p>

<h2>Controlling Contrasts and Composition</h2>

<p>By establishing my <strong>full value range</strong>, from the darkest darks to the white of the paper, I can better judge other values. I add the darkest accents in areas I want to draw attention to, like the hair and mouth. This helps in making the drawing look three dimensional. <strong>Contrasts</strong> guide the viewer's eye to the <strong>focal points</strong>, and I control them carefully.</p>

<p>I use erasers not just for correcting mistakes but as drawing tools. By "drawing with the eraser," I can pull out highlights and refine edges. This is especially effective after applying charcoal powder, as it allows me to bring back the brightest areas and sharpen details.</p>

<h2>Level One - Simplify Before Detailing</h2>

<p>At this point, I recommend stopping for those at <strong>level one</strong>. Keep your shapes simple and focus on the overall composition. Use occasional softness in the background and experiment with edges selectively. The goal is to organize your value structure and ensure the focal point reads strongly.</p>

<p>Remember, it's important to maintain the simplicity of shapes and values before getting into details. This approach helps in creating a cohesive and compelling drawing without getting overwhelmed by complexities.</p>

<h2>Moving to Level Two</h2>

<p>For those ready to proceed to <strong>level two</strong>, we'll start adding more values and details, moving beyond the five-value system. We'll refine the composition while controlling the values within each area to bring the drawing to a finish. This involves introducing subtle gradations, more intricate edges, and additional nuances to enhance realism.</p>
