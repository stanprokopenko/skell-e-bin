<h2>My Early Days with Airbrush</h2>

<p>Back in the late '80s and early '90s, before digital was a thing, I built my professional portfolio with airbrush illustrations. This was my way of getting freelance illustration work. I'd carry my portfolio in a case, making appointments on the phone to sit with art directors. They would decide my fate while I nervously watched them flip through my work, hoping they'd like it.</p>

<p>At first, I was terribly nervous, fearing rejection. But over time, as I got more work, I grew confident. These illustrations were all jobs I got paid to do, some of them paid <strong>really well</strong> because there weren't many people doing this kind of exacting, controlled work. Most of my fellow students were more into expression, but I found a niche in commercial applications.</p>

<h2>The Traditional Portfolio Experience</h2>

<p>In those days, showing printed pieces was common. Art directors would look at them and say things like, "Oh, you must have worked for Bonnie," or "You must have worked for Bruce," because it was a small world, and they knew each other. This networking helped me get more work without even having to show my portfolio eventually.</p>

<h2>Struggling with the Airbrush</h2>

<p>Let me back up to when I was 18. I took a class in airbrush, and <strong>it was a disaster</strong>. My first attempt at an elaborate piece was this rose, done with water-soluble paints. On a hot day, my sweat dripped onto it, ruining the piece. I hated airbrush, the complexity, the process, it was all miserable.</p>

<p>But I knew airbrush was a way to get hired and become a professional artist, so I kept at it. I redid the rose, better enough to turn in for the assignment. At 19, my brother's band asked me to paint an album cover. I spent a week on it, and like the rose, the more I worked on it, the worse it got. Close to despair, I abandoned it.</p>

<h2>Persistence and Improvement</h2>

<p>I thought, "I'm 19." I shouldn't despair. I could live to be old. So I sat in my bedroom, and I decided to do it again. In record time, I created a new piece. Voila! Though they never made the album, it cost too much money, I kept improving.</p>

<p>A few years later, a pianist friend made a real album called <strong>Through the Fire</strong>, and wanted it written in molten gold. I designed the letters, which was easy, but rendering the gold was not. My studio buddy, John Dickinson, and I worked for a week trying to figure out what made gold look like gold, not like pee. He figured it out, it had to do with reflections.</p>

<h2>Learning from Collaboration</h2>

<p>We abandoned the original and started over. I was so proud of the result. I was 19 and starting to learn about how metals act and how to paint them. The album was printed, but unfortunately, the printing quality was awful and washed out. Still, I was growing into a professional by sharing studio space with someone smarter than me.</p>

<h2>The Pre-Digital World</h2>

<p>We didn't have Photoshop layers or 3D programs back then. Every job had to be painted by hand. Making pictures in the old days was so different, yet in some ways, it's exactly the same and probably always will be.</p>

<h2>Building Skills and Getting Clients</h2>

<p>In my 20s, I started to get pretty good at airbrush, paintbrush, and ballpoint pen. I did pieces for my portfolio to show potential clients what I could do. Eventually, I found clients who needed this kind of work. When you do a job well, they hire you again, and others in the industry notice and hire you too. At one point, I didn't even have to show my portfolio anymore. Art directors would say, "Marshall can do that."</p>

<h2>Working for Advertising Agencies</h2>

<p>Most of my work was for advertising agencies, focusing on high-tech and medical illustrations. I got branded as the illustrator and photo retoucher, particularly of machines. I did about <strong>750 jobs over 20-some years</strong>. Many were not as glamorous, lots of photo retouching, painting out flaws, or putting in new backgrounds, all with the airbrush.</p>

<h2>Landing Big Jobs</h2>

<p>I had the chance to work with <strong>Bonnie Toth</strong>, a renowned art director. She was initially suspicious, but when her regular illustrators weren't available, she gave me a chance. I worked on an oxygenator illustration that required precise technical accuracy. After delivering, Bonnie was pleased and started hiring me for various styles.</p>

<h2>Trying New Styles</h2>

<p>One day, she asked me to do an Old Master style illustration. I had just started teaching a class called <strong>Drawing from the Masters</strong>, so I told her I was the perfect person for it. She asked for samples, so I pulled out a Da Vinci and a Bridgman, experimenting with techniques using a toothbrush, airbrush, and ballpoint pen.</p>

<p>She showed it to the principal of the agency, and they decided I was their guy. She apologized that she only had <strong>$2,300</strong> for the job, which was far more than I expected to charge. I worked on a heart and lung illustration, struggling with it, doing it three times before I was satisfied.</p>

<h2>Achieving Success and Recognition</h2>

<p>Bonnie loved the final piece, and it was so well received that we won an award. We even made posters for medical conventions, and I signed a limited edition run. During this time, my signature evolved due to signing my name hundreds of times.</p>

<p>A year or so later, I did another piece in the same style, and it didn't take three attempts this time. Bonnie asked for it to be "more messy," so I used the toothbrush technique to add more texture. It was well received, and I continued enjoying the variety of work.</p>

<h2>The Challenge of Meeting Deadlines</h2>

<p>Not all jobs went smoothly. I remember working on a project that required me to illustrate four computers lined up. There were miscommunications, and I ended up redoing the illustration multiple times. Luckily, I was compensated each time, but it taught me the importance of clear communication and meeting deadlines.</p>

<h2>Discovering Digital Illustration</h2>

<p>After completing an airbrush job that required perfect gradations, I visited a department store where a salesman demonstrated an early version of Photoshop. He showed me how he could create flawless gradations and undo them instantly. I <strong>almost hyperventilated</strong>.</p>

<p>Shortly after, I switched to digital. I started using Photoshop to create illustrations, taking advantage of layers, movable reflections, and total control over light and textures. I learned tricks like adding noise to fix banding in smooth gradations. I even innovated several digital techniques.</p>

<h2>Embracing the New Technology</h2>

<p>I began scanning in my drawings and finishing them digitally. This allowed me to apply my understanding of light, transparency, and reflections using new tools. My clients appreciated the flexibility and quality of digital work. I asked Bonnie if it would help if I worked digitally, and she was thrilled.</p>

<p>I invested heavily in a powerful computer with <strong>128 megabytes of RAM</strong>, which cost <strong>$5,000</strong> just for the RAM. It was 1994, and I was one of the only people providing digital illustrations with such capabilities. It opened new opportunities and allowed me to work more efficiently.</p>

<h2>What Has Changed and What Remains the Same</h2>

<p>Before digital tools, making art was a completely different process. But some things haven't changed. Both then and now, we have to <strong>meet deadlines</strong> and <strong>maintain quality</strong>. Clients, whether they are paying large sums or small, expect us to deliver on time and up to standard.</p>

<h2>The Importance of Meeting Deadlines</h2>

<p>One of the hardest things is meeting deadlines. When you're young, you might push your body to get things done, but it takes a toll. Out of those 750 jobs, about 20 were excruciating, and a few left lasting impacts on my health. The money disappeared, but the injuries remain.</p>

<h2>Getting Clients and Delivering Quality</h2>

<p>Getting clients is a whole other topic. I often talk about it on the Draftsmen Podcast. It's about finding what you love enough to pursue, even if you never make money from it. Once you have clients, delivering work that meets or exceeds their expectations is crucial.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p>Though the tools and processes have changed dramatically, from airbrushes to digital tablets, the core aspects of being a freelance illustrator remain the same. It's about honing your skills, meeting deadlines, maintaining quality, and continuously learning and adapting.</p>

<p>My journey has been filled with challenges, learning experiences, and moments of pride. I hope sharing my story gives you insights into the freelance illustration world and helps you navigate your own artistic path.</p>
