<h2>Drawing Diggers with Blobs</h2>

<h3>Starting with Side and Front Views</h3>

<p>First, familiarize yourself with what a <strong>digger</strong> looks like. Begin by drawing a <strong>side view</strong> to understand its profile. Then, sketch a <strong>front view</strong> to see how the boom, arm, and bucket align <strong>left to right</strong>.</p>

<h3>Using Blobs to Establish 3D Form</h3>

<p>Instead of precise lines, start with a <strong>blob</strong> shape to represent the digger. Imagine this blob with the <strong>front end closer</strong> to you, this will be the front of the digger.</p>

<h3>Applying Rubber Bands to Indicate Planes</h3>

<p>Place a <strong>rubber band</strong> around the blob to define the <strong>front plane</strong>. This emphasizes that it's a distinct plane facing you. If the <strong>top part</strong> is closer, wrap a rubber band around the top and <strong>slice off the top plane</strong>. This technique helps you visualize the <strong>three-dimensional form</strong> and how different planes relate to each other.</p>

<h3>Observing Lines Moving Away</h3>

<p>By defining the planes, you notice that when a <strong>corner is closest</strong> to you, the lines extending away to the right and left <strong>ascend</strong> to your right and left. This observation is crucial in understanding perspective.</p>

<h2>Creating Upward and Downward Views</h2>

<h3>Drawing an Upward View</h3>

<p>Experiment by drawing a digger <strong>floating above</strong> you, an unusual but informative perspective. Begin with a blob, where the <strong>end closer</strong> to you is at the bottom. Define the sides using <strong>circumferential lines</strong> to represent the blob's equator and underbelly. This helps you grasp how lines curve and converge in an <strong>upward view</strong>.</p>

<h3>Multiple Perspectives in One Drawing</h3>

<p>You can manipulate perspectives for different parts:</p>

<ul>

<li>Place the <strong>platform</strong> in <strong>two-point perspective</strong>.</li>

<li>Have the <strong>cabin</strong> face you directly in <strong>one-point perspective</strong>.</li>

<li>Or, align both in one-point or two-point perspective but with <strong>different vanishing points</strong>.</li>

</ul>

<p>Remember, objects like the digger and elements like city streets can have <strong>independent vanishing points</strong>. Understanding this prevents confusion and expands your creative options.</p>

<h2>Limitations of Blobs in Precision</h2>

<h3>Challenges with Vanishing Points</h3>

<p>While blobs are excellent for general forms, they lack precision for <strong>exact vanishing points</strong>. This can pose issues when integrating characters into environments with specific perspectives.</p>

<h3>Characters in Environments</h3>

<p>If your character's <strong>feet don't look right</strong>, adding a <strong>grid</strong> on the ground can help. This provides a reference for the ground plane, ensuring your characters <strong>stand naturally</strong> within the scene.</p>

<h3>Combining Multiple Perspectives</h3>

<p>Recognize that:</p>

<ul>

<li>A character can <strong>tumble</strong> in space.</li>

<li>Different elements (street, digger, character) can each have their <strong>own orientation</strong>.</li>

<li>This diversity adds interest but requires careful consideration to maintain coherence.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Utilizing Blobs in Character Design</h2>

<h3>The Rubber Band Technique</h3>

<p>Wrap a <strong>rubber band</strong> around each shape or limb to transform it into a defined form. This technique, akin to placing a <strong>striped sock</strong> on an object, clarifies the direction and depth, which you can later refine or remove.</p>

<h3>The "Striped Sock" Maxim</h3>

<p>Adopt the Looney Tunes' principle, **"Put a striped sock on everything, you can take it off later."] ** This approach ensures clarity in your forms and enhances the three-dimensionality of your drawings.</p>

<h2>Exploring Character Creation</h2>

<h3>Overcoming Creative Blocks</h3>

<p>If you're unsure where to start with character creation:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Sketch various ideas</strong> without aiming for perfection.</li>

<li><strong>Explore boldly</strong>, knowing the first idea doesn't have to be perfect.</li>

<li>This practice encourages creativity and reduces fear of making mistakes.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Using Orthographic Views</h3>

<p>When uncertain about a shape:</p>

<ul>

<li>Draw the object in pure <strong>front</strong> or <strong>side view</strong>.</li>

<li>Consider adding <strong>back</strong>, <strong>top</strong>, and <strong>bottom views</strong>.</li>

<li>Creating an <strong>orthographic projection</strong> forces you to make clear decisions about the form and proportions.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Perspective in Cartoons</h3>

<p>Some cartoonists opt for minimal perspective to maintain a <strong>na√Øve style</strong>. While advanced drawing skills can make it challenging to revert to simpler styles, having a strong grasp of perspective enhances your overall ability. Early 20th-century cartoonists effectively combined perspective with stylization, enriching their work.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p>Understanding and applying these techniques expands your artistic repertoire. Remember that:</p>

<ul>

<li>Blobs are great for general forms but may lack precision.</li>

<li><strong>Perspective</strong> is a valuable tool, even in stylized art.</li>

<li>Experimentation leads to growth.</li>

</ul>

<p>Next, we'll <strong>turn blobs into boxes</strong> and <strong>draw airplanes</strong>, further building on these foundational skills.</p>
