<h2>Career Journey</h2>

<p>In June 2012, I quit my job as a middle school art teacher to focus on my portfolio and making comics. I created a webcomic called <strong>Space Mullet</strong>, uploading two pages a week, hoping to get noticed. Initially, I struggled with story and art, using Space Mullet as a learning canvas.</p>

<p>Dark Horse noticed Space Mullet in mid-2013 and offered me work in late 2013, which were my first paying gigs. This led to meeting Donnie Cates and working with him at Dark Horse in 2014. In 2015, I worked with Matthew Rosenberg at Marvel on a Quake one-shot. My journey started with trying to prove myself through my own stories.</p>

<h2>Influences</h2>

<p><strong>Calvin and Hobbes</strong> by Bill Watterson was a major influence, along with other comics from my local library. The Framingham Public Library had an incredible curated selection of comics, including manga. Influences include:</p>

<ul>

<li>Ed McGuinness (Deadpool)</li>

<li>Joe Madureira (X-Men)</li>

<li>Chris Bachalo (X-Men)</li>

<li>James Harren</li>

<li>Walt Simonson (Beta Ray Bill)</li>

<li>Jack Kirby</li>

<li>Masamune Shirow (Appleseed, Ghost in the Shell)</li>

<li>Otomo</li>

</ul>

<h2>Artistic Style</h2>

<p>My early style involved imitating artists like Ed McGuinness, Joe Madureira, and Chris Bachalo. I believe imitating other artists is a natural part of growing as an artist. Eventually, artists find their own voice and style. It's important to celebrate what excites you and figure out what works for you.</p>

<p>My style includes <strong>intense contrast in lighting</strong>, <strong>dynamic set pieces</strong>, and <strong>composition</strong>. I draw inspiration from outside comics, including movies, TV, and wrestling. Wrestling influenced fight scenes in Beta Ray Bill. I enjoy playing with time in comics, breaking down actions into multiple panels.</p>

<h2>Writing Process</h2>

<p>Writing is challenging for me, and I often doubt my abilities. Developing ideas can start from a small concept and grow into a big story. Writing from the heart and keeping things honest is important. Magneto is a great villain because his actions come from a place of raw experience. I prefer villains with understandable motives over purely evil characters. Heroes need to be relatable and grounded in everyday activities. Comics allow for showing everything about a character, casting them in any light needed for the story.</p>

<h2>Character and Environment Design</h2>

<p>Favorite character designs include 90s Rogue, Fin Fang Foom, Scourge, and Scarlet Spider. Design involves making established characters feel natural and real in the story. The early 90s Jim Lee X-Men squad is a favorite team. Environments in comics can reveal a lot about characters without explicit explanation.</p>

<p>Marvel stories often involve big events, and memorable visual elements are important. Shapes, ideas, and bold designs help readers remember places and moments in stories. You don't want two characters fighting in a dark room; context and scale make scenes memorable. Good design in location and environment is crucial, even in small spaces like a kitchen. Context matters for character movement and actions; aim for a visual feast. The space characters interact in is as important as the characters themselves.</p>

<p><strong>Detail</strong>: Include specific elements in the environment for characters to interact with.</p>

<p><strong>Design</strong>: Ensure there's a focal point for the eyes, making the scene interesting without clutter.</p>

<p>As a comic book artist, drawing environments multiple times requires a visual shorthand. Good design helps ground the scene and provides a visual reminder of the setting. Use big, bold elements like flags, clocks, or statues to anchor the scene. Many young artists focus on characters over backgrounds; detailed backgrounds make a difference.</p>

<p><strong>Readability vs. dynamics</strong>: Balance clear storytelling with dynamic, contrasting moments. Avoid making everything dynamic to the point of confusion; find grounded moments. Push and pull in storytelling comes with experience and practice.</p>

<h2>Advice for Aspiring Artists</h2>

<p>Passion should guide your focus; specialize in what you love, whether penciling, inking, or coloring. It's okay to try everything, but specialization can be beneficial. Starting small, like with a four-page comic, helps you learn and finish projects. Big ideas are fine, but finishing smaller projects shows you can stick the landing. Killing your darlings means accepting that initial projects won't be perfect. Self-doubt is common; fight through it and keep creating.</p>

<p>Motivation varies; for professionals, it's often about providing for family and personal pride. For those balancing a job and comics, it's okay to take breaks to avoid burnout. Prevent burnout by setting work hours, taking weekends off, and celebrating small victories. Working too hard without breaks can hinder long-term success.</p>

<p>Being creative and telling stories is a unique and valuable skill. Recognize your worth as a creative individual and don't be afraid to ask for fair compensation. Companies might try to shortchange you. Don't allow it to happen. You're a creative person. Not many people can do what you do. <strong>You're worth it.</strong></p>
