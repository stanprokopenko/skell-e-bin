<h2>What's in Premium?</h2>

<p>In this lesson, we learn how to transform organic forms into mechanical designs using linear perspective. Starting with an organic object, like a peccary skull, we observe its structures and landmarks to visualize how to convert its shapes into mechanical forms.</p>

<p>We establish the basic structure by drawing planes and lines to map out features in perspective, maintaining symmetry and visualizing the form in three dimensions. We then mechanize the form by incorporating elements like joints, hinges, hydraulics, wires, and gears, using our visual vocabulary to add convincing details.</p>

<p>We refine the drawing by adding details such as extended proportions, exposed frames, and features from the original form. By moving around the drawing and varying line weights, we balance the image and create depth. We also use markers to add value shifts and surface details, enhancing dimensionality.</p>

<p>Throughout the lesson, we focus on observation, structural understanding, and imagination to create dynamic and believable mechanical designs from organic forms.</p>
