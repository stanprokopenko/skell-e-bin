<h2>Embracing Render Heaven</h2>

<p>We often hear about "render hell," with "gestural hell" and "structural hell" not far behind. I love gesture, so the hellish nature isn't so bad. It's just a wobbly drawing. Structural hell can be rough, things get stiff. But let's get into <strong>render heaven</strong>. When you know what you're rendering, it's heaven, and that's what this is all about.</p>

<h2>Preparing the Foundation</h2>

<p>To reach render heaven, we need to understand the shapes underneath, how they link together, and how they flow beautifully. Then, rendering becomes fun, a beautiful thing to do. I'll spend more time on rendering and dive into the heavenly nature of rendering well with thought and feeling.</p>

<h2>Using the Right Tools</h2>

<p>I use a little charcoal piece. I break charcoal sticks and shave them into a triangle, usually two fingers wide. The charcoal becomes an extension of your hand. You can move fluidly. It's a much faster drawing instrument than any pencil. You're basically drawing with your fingers, just a little extension.</p>

<h2>Tackling Foreshortened Poses</h2>

<p>Let's draw <strong>Mrs. V</strong> in a foreshortened pose. For many artists, it's one of the hardest things to do, but it's my favorite kind. It's challenging but rewarding. The <strong>Liberty Bell</strong> helps me find the shape within the structures. I'm pulling across from the bottom of Mrs. V to find the push out of the greater trochanter and from the top to find the start of it.</p>

<h2>Building Structure</h2>

<p>Everything works around the hips. Right away, we've got a torpedo foreshortened leg. I'm finding the bones and following them through the body. Remember, the hips are fused, so the top and bottom of Mrs. V are definitely fused. Once I've established the greater trochanter and the hip shape, we've got a lot done in a short time.</p>

<h2>Practice Makes Perfect</h2>

<p>I'd suggest repeating this over and over on scrap paper until you're ready to continue to the next stage. Just do that repeatedly. Finding the egg shape inside that tube, and look at how much <strong>pentimento</strong> we can get out of this charcoal piece. It's easy to fade back, way easier than any pencil. Don't worry about messing up the surface, it adds to the beauty.</p>

<h2>Adding Gesture and Flow</h2>

<p>The neck is elongated because the head is going back. These little pipes help us out. It's a fluid mannequin at this point. I don't use mannequins, they're too stiff. I want the arm to flow all the way down to the longest finger. A good way to make the figure more gestural is to use the hair. Even if the model has short hair, you can continue that flow all the way through.</p>

<h2>Refining the Form</h2>

<p>Re-establishing initial marks and getting more sophisticated. Mrs. V now has some curve, and I'm pulling that leg over, curving the rectus femoris to find the trochanter. It's working well. From this angle, things get tricky. The abdominals push up and out and back in again, hiding the hip crest. I used to try to put the hip crest in but realized it's hidden behind these rolling hills.</p>

<h2>Avoiding Early Detail</h2>

<p>Don't do the hand too soon, you'll get bogged down and lose gesture. Come back and forth to find it, but focus on the main flow first. The main thing is that carpal ramp down to the longest finger.</p>

<h2>Embracing Abstraction</h2>

<p>Here's where <strong>abstract is your friend</strong>. I can say that the shapes are cloth because we're going to render this, so it has to mean something, but not necessarily. I'm thinking abstract, not a big queen like robe. I already have an idea in mind, this is an exhausted queen who has laid down after fleeing from the enemy to have a moment of respite.</p>

<h2>Giving the Drawing a Theme</h2>

<p>Let's give it a theme, <strong>anguish</strong>. We have lots of allegory. You can write anything into this. There are a million ways to tell the story, but having a theme helps guide the drawing.</p>

<h2>Managing Challenging Areas</h2>

<p>When things are big, I want big swathes. I'm working out the light here too. This difficult angle is fresh because we don't see it often. There's always a fight, especially with a difficult pose. The struggle came unexpectedly from the torpedo leg.</p>

<h2>Knowing When to Stop</h2>

<p>Sometimes, it's best to know when to stop. The drawing can be considered finished at various stages. For me, it's at its peak when there's enough said for the viewer to add to it if they need to.</p>

<p>This is our dessert. We've had all those digestible dinners, and now we've got a big dessert. We can put all that into action and render. Remember, with real desserts, one after another, you're going to be sick. So this is to be earned. I'll end this workshop with a render to show what can be done and inspire you in your journey forward.</p>
