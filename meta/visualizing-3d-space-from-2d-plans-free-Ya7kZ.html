<h2>What's in Premium?</h2>

<p>In this lesson, you'll learn how to transform a 2D plan into 3D forms by assigning heights to its features. Starting with a provided plan showing width and depth, you'll explore creative ways to define the heights:</p>

<ul>

<li>Invert positive and negative spaces.</li>

<li>Squash or stretch the height of portions.</li>

<li>Create floating elements connected by lines.</li>

</ul>

<p>Using templates, you'll draw height lines to track elevations and enhance the illusion of depth. By practicing with side and front elevations (orthographic projections), you'll ensure accuracy and understand true proportions.</p>

<p>The lesson guides you to think three-dimensionally, encouraging you to create your own forms and experiment with different views. You'll start simply, possibly using isometric graph paper to simplify the process, and gradually move toward more complex shapes.</p>
