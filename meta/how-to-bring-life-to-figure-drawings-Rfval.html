<p>Welcome back! In this lesson, we'll work with two simple shapes - <strong>bells and tubes</strong> - to create figures filled with life and movement. We'll explore how to <strong>run gesture between them</strong> and dive into the idea of <strong>animation in a still drawing</strong>. With some simple ideas and golden secrets, we'll transform lifeless figures into ones that are full of life. So grab your pencil, watch, listen, draw along, and repeat until you're drawing with all the confidence in the world. Let's get into it!</p>

<h2>Tools and Materials</h2>

<p>We'll be working with <strong>newsprint</strong> and a <strong>1710 Conte de Paris charcoal pencil</strong>. These tools are great for quick, loose sketches and allow for easy adjustments.</p>

<h2>Using Simple Shapes: Bells and Tubes</h2>

<h3>Mr. T and Mrs. V Mnemonics</h3>

<p>We'll start by using the mnemonics <strong>Mr. T</strong> and <strong>Mrs. V</strong> to simplify the torso. <strong>Mr. T</strong> represents the line from the <strong>collarbone down the sternum</strong>, acting as a central bar. <strong>Mrs. V</strong> represents the <strong>pelvic area</strong>, forming a V shape. By identifying these key landmarks, we can quickly establish the figure's structure.</p>

<h3>Halves and Quarters</h3>

<p>Break the torso into <strong>halves and quarters</strong>:</p>

<ul>

<li>From the <strong>shoulders down to the tenth rib</strong> is <strong>half</strong>.</li>

<li>From the tenth rib down to the <strong>iliac crest</strong> (top of the hip) is another half.</li>

<li>From the iliac crest down to the <strong>pubic triangle</strong> is half again.</li>

</ul>

<p>Think of this area as a <strong>big pair of underpants</strong>, a mnemonic to help visualize the shape.</p>

<h3>The Skydiver Mnemonic</h3>

<p>Visualize the torso as a <strong>skydiver</strong>:</p>

<ul>

<li>The <strong>collarbones</strong> are the arms.</li>

<li>The <strong>little hand lengths</strong> represent the body and legs.</li>

</ul>

<p>This helps in understanding the proportions and placing the <strong>sternum</strong> and <strong>linea alba</strong> (the line running down the abdominals).</p>

<h2>Drawing Faces Quickly</h2>

<p>When drawing faces quickly, use these proportional guidelines:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Link one eye to the other</strong>.</li>

<li>Ensure there's <strong>five eyes distance</strong> across the widest part of the skull.</li>

<li>From the <strong>eyebrow to the bottom of the nose</strong> is half.</li>

<li>From the bottom of the nose to the <strong>bottom lip</strong>, and then to the <strong>chin</strong>, divide the lower half accordingly.</li>

</ul>

<p>Keep the lines <strong>subtle</strong> and <strong>light</strong> to expedite your drawing, especially during quick sketches. Use the <strong>sternal muscle of the neck</strong> to indicate slight turns.</p>

<h2>The Importance of Quick Drawings</h2>

<p>Quick drawings, or <strong>short drawings</strong>, prepare you for any eventuality. They may seem similar, but there are huge differences when you look closer. It's not about speed, it's about the <strong>power of decision-making</strong> in your own time. These quick sketches help embed foundational lines into your subconscious. This allows you to draw confidently from life or imagination.</p>

<h2>Ghosting Back with a Chamois</h2>

<p>Using a <strong>chamois leather cloth</strong>, you can <strong>ghost back</strong> your drawing. This means lightly erasing to soften the lines, allowing you to adjust and refine without starting over. A chamois takes away a lot, giving you a <strong>fresh start</strong> whenever needed.</p>

<h2>Adding Dimension with Line Thickness</h2>

<p>Utilize the <strong>broad end of your pencil</strong> to create varying line thickness. <strong>Thick lines</strong> suggest areas that are <strong>closer or heavier</strong>, while <strong>thin lines</strong> indicate areas <strong>further away or in light</strong>. This technique adds <strong>dimension</strong> to your drawings without extensive shading.</p>

<h2>Pinch and Stretch</h2>

<p>Understanding the concepts of <strong>pinch and stretch</strong> is crucial:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Pinch</strong> occurs where muscles and flesh compress.</li>

<li><strong>Stretch</strong> happens on the opposite side where muscles extend.</li>

</ul>

<p>For example, when a leg moves, it can create a <strong>bulge</strong> where there's a pinch. Recognizing these areas adds realism and fluidity to your figures.</p>

<h2>Rendering: Pros and Cons</h2>

<p>While <strong>rendering</strong> can add depth, be cautious not to get <strong>bogged down</strong> in it. Over-rendering can make your drawing <strong>muddy</strong>, obscuring the foundational lines and proportions. Render is most effective when the foundation is solid. Use it to <strong>enhance</strong>, not to <strong>hide mistakes</strong>.</p>

<h2>The Role of Anatomy</h2>

<h3>Understanding Muscles and Bones</h3>

<p>A solid grasp of <strong>anatomy</strong> elevates your drawing:</p>

<ul>

<li>Know where the <strong>bones</strong> are to establish structure.</li>

<li>Understand how <strong>muscles</strong> like the <strong>brachialis</strong>, <strong>brachioradialis</strong>, and <strong>magnus adductor</strong> interact.</li>

<li>Recognize that <strong>flesh is thick and heavy</strong>, affecting how muscles and bones are depicted.</li>

</ul>

<h3>The Female Figure</h3>

<p>The female figure is especially challenging due to its subtlety:</p>

<ul>

<li>Extra layers of <strong>subcutaneous fat</strong> make bones harder to find.</li>

<li><strong>Landmarks</strong> like the <strong>clavicles</strong>, <strong>navel</strong>, and <strong>crest of the hips</strong> are essential.</li>

<li>Consider the <strong>softness</strong> of features like the <strong>breasts</strong>, which sit atop the <strong>hard ribcage</strong>.</li>

</ul>

<h2>The Magic of Mileage</h2>

<p><strong>Mileage</strong> refers to the practice gained from numerous drawings. The more you draw, the more these methods become second nature. This allows you to:</p>

<ul>

<li>Draw <strong>confidently</strong> from imagination.</li>

<li>Make <strong>adjustments on the fly</strong>.</li>

<li>Develop a sense of <strong>rhythm</strong> in your work.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Drawing from Imagination</h2>

<p>With practice, you can:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Change shapes</strong> around as you see fit.</li>

<li>Use the <strong>tube and bell</strong> method to move the <strong>top egg</strong> (ribcage) around.</li>

<li><strong>Experiment</strong> with different body types and poses.</li>

</ul>

<p>Mileage helps you internalize proportions and shapes, freeing you to create dynamic figures.</p>

<h2>Creating the Illusion of Movement</h2>

<p>To make a figure appear animated:</p>

<ul>

<li>Incorporate <strong>pinches</strong> where movement compresses the body.</li>

<li>Use <strong>gesture lines</strong> to link structures fluidly.</li>

<li>Shift the <strong>weight balance</strong> to suggest motion.</li>

</ul>

<p>This technique brings <strong>stillness in motion</strong>, making your figures look alive.</p>

<h2>Balancing Gesture and Structure</h2>

<p>While gesture adds <strong>fluidity</strong>, structure provides <strong>stability</strong>. Balance them by:</p>

<ul>

<li>Starting with <strong>simple shapes</strong> like tubes and bells.</li>

<li>Adding <strong>anatomical details</strong> to areas like the <strong>forearm</strong>, which can't be left tubular.</li>

<li>Using <strong>gravity</strong> to inform the pose and weight distribution.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Building Confidence Through Practice</h2>

<p>Practice allows you to:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Internalize</strong> the mechanics of drawing.</li>

<li><strong>Draw faster</strong> and more accurately.</li>

<li>Focus on <strong>expression</strong> rather than perfection.</li>

</ul>

<p>Remember, there's no such thing as a perfect drawing. The goal is to express and communicate through your art.</p>

<h2>Embracing Personal Style</h2>

<p>Learn from others but bring in your <strong>unique take</strong>:</p>

<ul>

<li>Take inspiration from various teachers.</li>

<li><strong>Imbibe</strong> what resonates and <strong>discard</strong> what doesn't.</li>

<li><strong>Experiment</strong> to find your own style.</li>

</ul>

<p>Avoid being a clone of any artist. Your individuality makes your art special.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p>By using simple shapes like <strong>bells and tubes</strong>, understanding anatomy, and practicing diligently, you can create figures filled with life and movement. Embrace the methods, but remember they're not rigid rules. Let your <strong>mileage</strong> guide you, and don't be afraid to <strong>bring in your unique style</strong>. Keep drawing, keep experimenting, and most importantly, enjoy the journey of becoming the magician of art.</p>
