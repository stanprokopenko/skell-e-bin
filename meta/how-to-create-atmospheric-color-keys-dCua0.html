<h2>Setting Up the Scene</h2>

<p>I decided to take one of my <strong>color keys</strong> and refine it further, focusing on an exterior scene. I began with my line art on a separate layer set to multiply mode, allowing me to paint underneath. This setup helps keep the sketch visible while working on the colors beneath.</p>

<h2>Building the Background</h2>

<h3>Choosing Reference and Base Colors</h3>

<p>I referred to some key art images, gravitating towards a <strong>misty, moody, fire season atmosphere</strong>. Instead of color picking from the reference, I manually selected colors. I filled the canvas with a <strong>desaturated gray</strong>, serving as a base.</p>

<h3>Adding Sky and Glow</h3>

<p>For the sky, I chose a warm tone, creating a gradient with a glow that transitions from bright grays into purples and dark foregrounds. I added the sun by working through the color temperature, from reds to oranges to yellows, placing it to simulate the sun's glow through smoke.</p>

<h2>Adding Depth and Atmosphere</h2>

<h3>Layering Elements</h3>

<p>To create depth, I layered elements like the house and trees. The <strong>foggy atmosphere</strong> makes the character stand out, and layering helps establish the distance between foreground and background. I added reflections in the water using colors from the sky, imagining the water as a mirror reflecting the scene above.</p>

<h3>Understanding Soft Shadows</h3>

<p>Understanding the <strong>physics of light</strong> is crucial. I applied <strong>soft shadows</strong> and <strong>ambient occlusion</strong> to areas like under the porch and roof edges, where light is occluded. This adds form and realism to the structures. Darkening occurs between trees that are closer together, enhancing the depth.</p>

<h2>Refining the Foreground</h2>

<h3>Enhancing the Character</h3>

<p>Noticing that the character was blending into the background, I added a <strong>rim light</strong> to make the silhouette stand out. By increasing the contrast around the character, the lightest lights and the darkest darks, I ensured that the viewer's eye is drawn there first.</p>

<h3>Focusing the Viewerâ€™s Attention</h3>

<p>I used bushes and darkened areas on the sides to <strong>frame the image</strong>, keeping the viewer's gaze within the composition. Adding subtle highlights and adjusting contrasts helps guide the eye to important elements.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p>I experimented with adding a warm glow inside the house, suggesting something intriguing happening there. Turning off the line art layer helped me assess if the scene was understandable based solely on lighting and color, aiming for a <strong>photographically believable</strong> look rather than comic-style line art.</p>

<p>By focusing on mood and lighting before refining details, I created a <strong>smoky, atmospheric scene</strong> that effectively communicates the desired feeling. This <strong>color key</strong> serves as a solid foundation for further development or as guidance for lighting artists.</p>
