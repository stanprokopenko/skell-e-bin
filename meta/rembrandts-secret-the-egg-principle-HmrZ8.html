<p>Let's take a moment to step away from painting and dive into the <strong>egg principle</strong>. This technique was taught to me by my teacher and is a powerful tool in creating realistic light and shadow. Rembrandt is often cited as a master of this principle, and his portraits are a testament to its effectiveness. When you see a Rembrandt from across a room, the glow of his portraits is unmistakable.</p>

<h2>Understanding the Egg Principle</h2>

<p>The <strong>egg principle</strong> is straightforward. Imagine an egg with a light source above it. The highlight is the brightest spot on the egg, and as the light cascades down, it gradually transitions into shadow. This is similar to rendering a ball, where the lightest area is closest to the light source, and it gets darker as it moves away.</p>

<h2>Application of the Egg Principle in Painting</h2>

<p>When applying the egg principle to a human head, think of the head as an egg with features. The light source direction is crucial. For instance, if the light is coming from above, the forehead will have the lightest highlights. As you move down the face, the light should gradually get darker, maintaining the integrity of the light source.</p>

<h2>Importance of Restraint in Highlight Application</h2>

<p>It's tempting to apply equal highlights across the head, but restraint is key. Ensure that highlights are consistent with the light source direction. The transition from light to shadow should be gradual, creating a realistic three-dimensional effect. Remember, the lightest area should be closest to the light source, and nothing else should compete with it.</p>

<h2>Rembrandt's Use of the Egg Principle</h2>

<p>Rembrandt's subtle use of the egg principle is what gives his portraits their magical glow. He carefully transitions values from light to dark, maintaining a hierarchy of light. Observing his work can provide valuable insights into how to apply this principle effectively. His portraits demonstrate how the egg principle can create a sense of depth and realism.</p>

<p>The egg principle is a powerful tool in creating a three-dimensional effect in your paintings. By understanding and applying this principle, you can achieve a sense of light and shadow that brings your work closer to the mastery of artists like Rembrandt. Keep this principle in mind as you continue to develop your painting skills.</p>
