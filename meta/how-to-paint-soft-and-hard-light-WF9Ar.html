<h2>Types of Light Sources</h2>

<p>Light in your paintings can come from various sources, but all light behaves the same way. The effect depends on the properties of the light source and the environment. Light sources like the sun emit light in all directions, but due to its distance, sunlight appears to travel in a single direction, creating predictable shadows.</p>

<p><strong>Closer light sources</strong>, like a light bulb, emit light in all directions, and <strong>light falloff</strong> becomes significant. Objects further from the light source become exponentially darker, and shadows vary based on distance and angle to the light.</p>

<h2>Light Falloff</h2>

<p>Light falloff depends on the relative distance between the object and the light source. Doubling the distance doesn't just halve the light intensity, it reduces it exponentially. This means objects that are twice as far from the light source become dramatically darker.</p>

<h2>Hard Light vs. Soft Light</h2>

<p><strong>Hard light</strong> comes from a single, direct light source, creating sharp, well-defined shadows and a clear distinction between light and shadow areas. The sun on a clear day is an example.</p>

<p><strong>Soft light</strong> occurs when light is scattered, such as on a cloudy day. Light comes from multiple directions, softening shadows and diffusing highlights. This scattering happens when light passes through a translucent surface, like clouds, which diffuse the light and create softer, more subtle shadows.</p>

<h2>Scattering and Occlusion Shadows</h2>

<p>Scattered light produces <strong>occlusion shadows</strong>, soft, dark areas where light cannot reach, often where objects touch. These shadows are darker because multiple light sources struggle to illuminate these tight spaces. Including occlusion shadows in your paintings helps ground objects, making them feel more realistic.</p>

<h2>Reflected Light</h2>

<p>Light doesn't just hit an object and stop, it reflects off surfaces. Understanding <strong>reflected light</strong> is key to creating vibrant paintings. The reflected light can brighten shadow areas, and affect the color and mood of the scene.</p>

<p>For example, sunlight reflects off the ground and illuminates the underside of objects. In an interior scene, light can bounce multiple times, filling the space with soft light after several reflections.</p>

<h2>Practical Application in Painting</h2>

<p>When painting, consider:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Brightness of the light source</strong>: How intense is it?</li>

<li><strong>Distance to the light source</strong>: How does light fall off?</li>

<li><strong>Direction of light</strong>: Where is the light coming from?</li>

<li><strong>Reflections and scattering</strong>: How does light interact with surfaces?</li>

</ul>

<p>By understanding these principles, you can accurately depict lighting scenarios, whether you're painting from life or imagination. Incorporating hard and soft light, occlusion shadows, and reflected light will make your paintings more realistic and dynamic.</p>

<h2>Assignment</h2>

<p>Practice applying these concepts:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Easy</strong>: Do painting studies from provided references, focusing on light principles.</li>

<li><strong>Intermediate</strong>: Paint your own subjects from life, observing how light behaves.</li>

<li><strong>Advanced</strong>: Take a reference image and add a new light source or change the lighting entirely from imagination.</li>

</ul>

<p>A little practice with these ideas can significantly elevate your paintings. Good luck with your assignment!</p>
