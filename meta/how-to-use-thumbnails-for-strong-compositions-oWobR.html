<p>Next, I'm moving on to <strong>thumbnailing</strong>, which is the process of drawing little itty-bitty drawings of the full composition of what I'm thinking of. I think this process is actually the most fun part for me because, in my imagination, I get to see the final image without any of the work. So let's get to it.</p>

<h2>Starting with the Basic Idea and Focal Point</h2>

<p>I begin by drawing the frame myself. It makes me feel like the whole thing can be loose, and I don't have to worry about it looking great. This sets the tone for what I'm going to do.</p>

<p>My most basic idea so far is including a cute version of the bunny character, kind of looking at the camera. It could be a baby version like my son, so let's roll with that first. He's the <strong>focal point</strong>, this main character, so he's right in the center.</p>

<p>I call that out because whatever your focal point is within an image, you generally want all the other elements to support it somehow, both in terms of color but in this case <strong>compositionally</strong>.</p>

<h2>Using Perspective to Guide Composition</h2>

<p>One of the most common ways to do that is to have your focal point as the center of attention and have a lot of lines pointing towards it.</p>

<h3>One-Point Perspective</h3>

<p>For me, this often ends up being a <strong>one-point perspective</strong>, where all the lines <strong>converge at one point</strong>.</p>

<h3>Two-Point Perspective</h3>

<p><strong>Two-point perspective</strong>, by comparison, is where there's two different points in the image where lines converge towards them.</p>

<h3>Affinity of Line</h3>

<p>One of the things I learned in film school is this concept called <strong>affinity of line</strong>. What it really means is that unless you have enough lines pointing you to that one point in which they converge, it doesn't count. Even if technically there are a few lines doing that, the more you have, the stronger the sense of perspective is.</p>

<p>Adding hard-shaped objects that align to the space and create those lines is generally going to be the most organic way to do it. You can cheat as well and add elements in the piece that happen to, flow-wise, steer you towards it.</p>

<p>At this stage, let's talk about how adding these hard-surfaced objects like walls, sidewalks, and concrete are all organically going to steer us towards this point.</p>

<p>Other things that might come in handy are like a telephone pole that is similarly trailing off into the distance and therefore all going to that same point.</p>

<p>For my illustration, I know that I wanted to have those <strong>AC units</strong>. Those AC units are hard-surfaced objects, they're all kind of big boxes, and they can similarly function as a way to add that affinity of line.</p>

<p>If I'm thinking about adding AC units on the side here, wherever I put them, if they're aligning to the space perpendicular to our perspective lines, then no matter where I put them, lower on the screen or higher, they will include lines that do what I'm talking about.</p>

<h2>Storytelling in Thumbnails</h2>

<p>So for my illustration, I'm thinking of having my main character here with the affinity of line steering us towards him.</p>

<p>At this point, I can think of novel ways to include AC units, but I could also think about <strong>what is the story here? Where do I want you to look? And as you're looking, what kind of emotion or narrative or just general vibe are you going to feel?</strong></p>

<p>For me, I tend to want to start with that idea first because it can guide everything else. Knowing what you want your audience to experience as they look at your piece is a really good way to have everything else be guided by a singular idea, which helps a lot later down the line.</p>

<p>If you don't have that, then it turns into this general confusion of like this piece could be five different things, and that's where you really can get lost. What will generally stump people on giving up on a piece is they haven't decided what the point of the piece is and what they wanted to communicate. So they are arguing with themselves the entire time they're drawing it on what it could be instead.</p>

<p>Obviously, there's room for adapting and changing things just depending on how things go. But the stronger of a vision you have going into it on what the experience is you're going to convey, the tighter everything else will be and the more purpose you can give to every element of the piece.</p>

<h2>Developing the Narrative</h2>

<p>I said I want my main character here to be looking at the camera. <strong>Why is he looking at the camera and why is he standing there</strong> would be my questions to myself before I have my thesis.</p>

<p>I have an ingredient I'm playing with, right? So answering the question can sometimes include filling in the blanks of that sentence.</p>

<p>At different points, sometimes you know exactly the emotion and you're trying to convey the emotion. Sometimes you have the character and you need to decide what the emotion is to complete that thought.</p>

<p>So if he's standing here and he's by himself, this cute little guy, then maybe the idea for me is that he looks like he's on an adventure, and that he's really cute, but he's really tough. And I want to convey the idea of this character of like this badass little bunny, that he's in this space that he has control over even though he's really small and cute.</p>

<p>So that would be kind of like he's glaring at the camera like, "Yeah, nothing can stop me." And everything around him needs to support the idea that he's tough despite being so small.</p>

<h3>Adding Supporting Elements</h3>

<p>So let's play with that idea. <strong>Motorcycles</strong> add to that tone of like he's a biker or he's in this area where there are bikers.</p>

<p>The way we convey that he's tough is that he's being cornered by a <strong>biker gang</strong> because he's so small. I feel like that lends playful realism, and we can say that they don't have to be human even.</p>

<p>So let's say we want now a scene where he's being cornered by this biker gang. And just because I'm thinking about the cats that I drew earlier, maybe it's a <strong>cat biker gang</strong>.</p>

<h3>Eye Lines and Composition</h3>

<p>There's two things I'm thinking about at the same time, which is that they need to be <strong>looking at him</strong> because that's one way to add that affinity of line, even <strong>eye line is a line</strong> that causes us to follow the gaze.</p>

<p>So if they're looking at him and they're sizing him up, then that's going to do those two goals at the same time. It's going to make us interested in this character as a tough guy dealing with these bikers. It's going to add the affinity of line of them looking at him and steering our gaze towards him. And it's going to add that atmosphere of the tone that I want with the motorcycles and it feeling like Singapore.</p>

<p>Compositionally, we may need some cats who are not on bikes just because bikes are big and hard to draw, and I don't want to draw too many of them. So maybe they're cornering him behind as well.</p>

<p>The great thing about cats is they don't have to all be on the ground, they can be crawling on our AC units.</p>

<p>So let's say we have one here just for the sake of being close to him. And I feel like a cat that's up here, because he's looking down, it's almost a position of power sometimes.</p>

<p>In my head, I'm brainstorming like maybe it's not just a cat, but maybe this is like the <strong>boss cat</strong>. So whereas the other cats didn't get faces for this rough thumbnail, maybe this cat is the one that's in charge, and I'm giving him a <strong>fish bone</strong> as if he's the one who's going to have the dialogue in this scene being like, "Hey, what are you doing? This is our turf."</p>

<h3>Developing the Story Further</h3>

<p>The posing also means that these cats don't always have to be walking on all four legs. I guess they're riding bikes, right? So that's kind of giving me information as the creator on what kind of world this is, on what kind of rules I can break or play with.</p>

<p>So <strong>why are they cornering this guy</strong>? Is it just because he is standing there? Maybe that's fine if it was an actual story, but maybe he has something that they want.</p>

<p>So internally for me, thinking about why is this thing happening, I'm organically saying, okay, he must have something that they want, and visually I need to show it. It's not like a file on his iPhone in his pocket, right? It's like we want to see something.</p>

<p>So that is informing his design. So maybe he's got a <strong>backpack</strong>. And that's informing his pose.</p>

<h3>Readability and Lighting</h3>

<p>The idea of <strong>readability</strong> comes into play here. In order for him to stand out, she's got to be kind of dark just so that his <strong>silhouette</strong> can pop out, right? But she similarly has a silhouette that needs to stand out against the background.</p>

<p>So whatever her pose is, I want to see what she's doing with her arms. It looks like because she's kind of half covered up on the lower half. So what can I do with her arms that will reveal more story, add more interest, maybe even the purpose of the pose might be to add that affinity of line that I was talking about.</p>

<p>Just going through some ideation here. I feel like this wasn't bad, it was my instinct. So her elbow is pointing towards our main character here. Her forearm is also adding flow, which will move her over.</p>

<p>She definitely makes sense to have a backpack. I don't know if he should also. It's kind of a duplicate idea. So as I'm doing this, I may think of something for him to be doing that's different. Maybe rather than a backpack, which was covering her up a little bit, maybe he's <strong>holding it in the front</strong>. That also is a little bit more clear with the story too because now he's actively got it in front of him.</p>

<p>So now we see that he's doing it, it's not just an accessory. So if he's carrying something, then we have the two characters doing different things. It's not like same same, and more variety is more interesting, right?</p>

<h3>Considering the Background and Negative Space</h3>

<p>The next part that I'm thinking about is this <strong>background</strong>, this <strong>negative space</strong>, right? We could just have more AC vents, and maybe that's part of the charm of the space, but I'm really thinking about the negative space behind her.</p>

<p>Like I said, I want them to read really clearly. I'm thinking that this alley has to be darker than the background so that literally what I'm saying is that they're going to be kind of in shadow, like the lighting is going to be darker on them, and behind them it can be a brighter landscape in which now they're going to pop forward.</p>

<p>So what that means is like this area here might be kind of blown out, and therefore it's not really going to be important story-wise. But what it's doing story-wise is helping shine a light on our main characters and making the focal point really read.</p>

<p>So the angle of this, I think intentionally having that curve to lead your eye to your character. It doesn't have to be a straight grid in the background. This happens in real life, but you can manipulate buildings to be in a way where they just serve your purpose of <strong>guiding the eye around</strong>.</p>

<h2>Exploring Different Thumbnail Ideas</h2>

<h3>Thumbnail 1: One-Point Perspective with Bunny Character and Biker Gang</h3>

<p>I have my first thumbnail where I used a one-point perspective to emphasize my main character being cornered by a biker gang of cats.</p>

<h3>Thumbnail 2: Two-Point Perspective and Choice Paths</h3>

<p>For the next thumbnail, I'm thinking that as opposed to a one-point perspective where everything's leading to our central character, just for fun, let's play with a <strong>two-point perspective</strong>.</p>

<p>So to diagram what that means, there are two spots on our image in which lines converge. This is like what I'm imagining as a building, and then there's roads leading on both sides of it away from that corner of the building.</p>

<p>What is this useful for? Well, one, I'm just playing with the idea of having it. So I'm kind of challenging myself to come up with an idea that fits into this perspective.</p>

<p>By virtue of there being two points of interest here in which the lines converge, that can kind of mean there's two different places that I want the viewer to look.</p>

<p>One very straightforward approach might be to say that there's two different paths here. Maybe it's a fork in the road that literally the central character is deciding between.</p>

<h3>Developing the Scene</h3>

<p>For example, we put in a character, maybe it's our little bunny friend, who is deciding where to go. And I think based off of this pose, they are probably deciding or giving directions.</p>

<p>And just because they're facing away from us, I'm thinking that they can be talking to somebody else. Just for the sake of our thumbnailing and abbreviating something, I'm gonna make it <strong>Saturn Donuts Girl</strong>.</p>

<p>So I'm having her hunched over to talk to this person. So they're in this kind of pose in which it's clear that they're engaging with each other.</p>

<p>I'm deciding that our rabbit character is the one telling our Saturn Donuts Girl where to go. So this little finger here is pointing to this direction.</p>

<h3>Using Composition to Support the Idea</h3>

<p>That's one way in which thinking about the perspective and where the eyes can be led to or what the spaces can help start the prompt for a story dictate what you think might be interesting to explore.</p>

<p>Actually, the reason why I initially thought about this composition was that I liked within my references having a lot of AC units. This corner here is kind of a great space to put a lot of those things.</p>

<p>Now that I'm implementing this, it's starting to make the structure feel almost like it's the focal point or the main star, and this is kind of defining the atmosphere of the piece because it's right in the center.</p>

<p>And for my side roads here, I can change the angle a bit so that we can get a little bit more of them in there, and then I can also add more.</p>

<p>So if I just want the excuse to really utilize the research in a way where the main thing that I was interested in was the AC units, then maybe thinking of a composition that allows me to explore more is something that might be great for that.</p>

<h3>Adjusting the Story</h3>

<p>Why are there two different roads, and what is she choosing between? Or yeah, I guess she's the one who needs to decide where to go.</p>

<p>Changing up my idea a little bit, rather than interacting with him like that, she can be looking towards the road. That's going to create a little bit more movement to move from the left side of the page to the right side of the page.</p>

<p>She is a delivery girl, so she's delivering donuts. That is made clear by the fact that I'm putting that in front as we discussed with this idea here.</p>

<p>Just by virtue of the height that this character is at versus here, she would have to be squatting, but we could put her on a bike.</p>

<p>So just reusing all the things, and there is my helmet guy, his chest and the wheel, and it's at the angle that we studied because that's what I'm comfortable with at this moment in time.</p>

<p>Compared to this one, which is very cartoony and about kind of like an intense face-off, this is a much more kind of <strong>slice-of-life</strong> scene. But the interest or maybe magic of it could be a similar tone of magical creatures existing.</p>

<h3>Adding Elements for Atmosphere</h3>

<p>So if this isn't a mask per se, but like the actual head of the character, then maybe the appeal of this one is it's a relaxing vibe. It's kind of peaceful, real-life Singapore, but with cute characters.</p>

<p>And compared to this one, which was kind of dirty, gritty alley, maybe this one is the <strong>solarpunk</strong> thing that we were researching.</p>

<p>So maybe I need to put like a store in here, that's going to have lots of plants and foliage. Similarly, I can just imagine like there's windows with foliage sticking out here. Maybe there's like trees or something sticking out here, overgrowth on the buildings.</p>

<p>Just kind of like a utopic solarpunk look. Can play with a skyline having some green, or maybe it's just beautiful open sky. All that is kind of the same note of the atmosphere of this piece. I want it to be calm and peaceful to look at.</p>

<p>Maybe it's just something that you'd like, if you're imagining putting this up on a wall, that when you look at it, you feel relaxed, as opposed to this one which was like kind of the cover of a manga that is pretty interesting, but maybe that's not the energy that you want for the piece.</p>

<h3>Adding Characters and Variety</h3>

<p>To fill out the bottom area here, all that research that we did with plants, very easy to kind of just fill in the blanks here.</p>

<p>If we want to play with a little bit more story, I researched cats, and I'm just thinking about cats because in this piece, cats are a natural fit.</p>

<p>So if we want to, we could throw in some cats.</p>

<p>Or we could decide to create an entire universe in which everyone has this bunny hat or bunny head or whatever it is.</p>

<p>So if we put like an old bunny guy in the background here, maybe that's who she's looking for. Maybe since this is more slice-of-life, there's just pedestrians over here who have the same hat.</p>

<p>And then everything's kind of normal about this piece, except for the fact that it's taking place in this weird bunny universe. But maybe that's the charm, you know, it's just kind of slightly whimsical.</p>

<p>I'm obviously being playful with it without necessarily needing to think too deeply about a narrative that is action-oriented or over the top. This depends on what we want.</p>

<h3>Thumbnail 3: Combining Tones and Characters</h3>

<p>For the next one, I'm thinking about recording this horizontally because it's on an iPad horizontally. It's going to be in a horizontal format. I probably should have made the previous ones horizontal, that's a consideration that you should think about before you start next time.</p>

<p>So for a horizontal piece, I will say I like this tone a bit more compared to the first one, but I wish I could see his face.</p>

<p>I liked the idea of this <strong>bunny guide</strong> for Saturn Donuts Girl. So if you come up with a thumbnail, you like elements of it, you can riff off of yourself. Whittle down the ideas until you like everything about it or at least enough of it to play.</p>

<h3>Exploring Character Interaction</h3>

<p>Okay, so horizontal, I want to see his face, and just because I'm thinking about it, he's gonna have the same backpack as he used to have, get that backpack back.</p>

<p>And because he is so short, the human being who he's talking to, if he's this size, which is the priority, like I'm making decisions based off of my focal point character being readable and at a size I like, it's telling me that if there's another character in the scene, they kind of have to be hunched over or kneeling.</p>

<p>I kind of like, this might be a little silly, but I kind of like the vibe of some of the dirty grittiness of the first one. Maybe the piece is as peaceful and relaxing as the second one. So if I can take the parts of each that I like and make something that I'm happy with, then maybe this is like a <strong>biker dude</strong> who is gritty and unsavory looking.</p>

<h3>Adding Details and Story Elements</h3>

<p>I gave him glasses, but actually I think an <strong>eye patch</strong> is even better because it's just like the story behind an eye patch is always something.</p>

<p>So an unsavory type, I can express that with some <strong>tattoos</strong>. So he's got fun tattoos, maybe his tattoos are of AC vents.</p>

<p>He's hunched over like this. This is definitely just using the bigger visual library that I have to access some of these things. But that's the sort of stuff that you'll get over time if you keep at it. Drawing gets easier and more fun the more you invest into it.</p>

<p>I'm not sure what I want to do with this arm yet, like if he's just talking to him or giving him advice. I could do the same thing where he's pointing Bunny Boy where to go, but I do like the squat on the ground with the <strong>cigarette</strong>, that is fun.</p>

<p>I did this before in another piece, but like having the cigarette smoke intentionally kind of flow into this character, not only is it a statement of like how he doesn't care about him, but also it moves your eye to that character as well.</p>

<h3>Considering Composition and Lighting</h3>

<p>So for now, he's just talking to him. I may adjust this later, but this arm so far is just going like that.</p>

<p>This might be a little bit too tight of a shot for me to get everything I want, so I'm going to shrink this down a little bit.</p>

<p>It's definitely kind of a duo now, but behind him we can do our trusty <strong>helmet bike</strong> because that's what this guy rides.</p>

<p>And the fun thing about any of these intense hard-surface objects like motorcycles or whatever is one way to distract from how well you're actually able to draw them, but also just to add visual interest is to like cover them in <strong>stickers</strong> or rough them up, make them look beat up and things like that.</p>

<p>The sort of details that will add personality and make it say like, oh, this is a rough bike from some sort of gangster, but also give you a chance to maybe obscure some of the parts that you're less familiar with or don't want to draw as much.</p>

<p>Okay, so he's sitting here on the side of the road. I like the <strong>solarpunk</strong> vibe, so it's just like that combination of grit and relaxing beauty.</p>

<p>So putting in some of these <strong>plants</strong> on the side of the road, maybe they're literally growing out of the concrete.</p>

<h3>Adjusting Elements for Readability</h3>

<p>I erased part of what I had assumed was the motorcycle because it was obscuring his <strong>silhouette</strong> too much for me. In the real illustration, if I were to fully draw this out, I might keep it there, but primarily I need to have their silhouettes be readable.</p>

<p>So to that end, just so I wouldn't have to deal with that sort of thing, I might actually even push this motorcycle back into the background so it just has no chance of really obscuring the important part, which is his head.</p>

<p>I usually try not to worry too much about the faces when doing a thumbnail, just because sometimes you can be like, oh, that part is ugly, and now I have to work forever to make this thumbnail pretty.</p>

<p>But what it's useful for is honing in on the emotion and tone that you are going for. It's kind of a blank look, it's not like he's having an intense emotion, but the connection between them, I feel like drawing that in for me helps me feel out what's going on here.</p>

<p>Oh, one detail that will be cool to hide more motorcycle is to have his <strong>jacket over his shoulder</strong>, and then the jacket can also be tattered or have more character.</p>

<h3>Adding Story Elements</h3>

<p>I like this bottom half a lot. Right now it could go either way for a one-point or a two-point perspective.</p>

<p>I did like having more opportunity or real estate for the AC stuff.</p>

<p>Let's try it out, so it's a two-point in the middle here. This is particularly useful because this corner is pointing our eye to both of our characters, who happen to be well-positioned for this.</p>

<p>I'll have these lines point at our bunny boy, and these lines are now just pointing at him.</p>

<p>You can play with this geometry so they're not all the same height building all leading that way.</p>

<p>Maybe this is just like a pipe that's running through the building, but the building's all the way tall just so that this top area here is not monotonous or too symmetrical.</p>

<p>Over here, I like the idea of more overhanging plants for that solarpunk vibe, with obviously the AC units.</p>

<h2>Thumbnail 4: Adding a Personal Touch</h2>

<h3>Drawing My Son and Wife</h3>

<p>For this last one, I'm taking this excuse to draw my son and wife because I love them.</p>

<p>What happened the other day is that <strong>Conan</strong> started walking for the first time with us only holding one hand. So he's basically right on the cusp of learning how to walk.</p>

<p>But the pose that I really liked seeing was him <strong>holding two hands</strong>. So this is my wife, for the sake of not embarrassing her too much, I'll probably make her <strong>Saturn Donuts Girl</strong>.</p>

<p>But then Bunny Boy was just holding on to both hands like this, that's Conan, that's my son.</p>

<p>He's so funny because he's not like frowning, but he's just so pleased with himself when he's learning something new, and he kind of has that little aggressive excitement, let's say.</p>

<p>He's like barely standing, but doing great.</p>

<h3>Exploring Warp Perspective</h3>

<p>The reason why I like this pose is because my wife was wearing kind of baggier pants, so it was like a very strong T-shape like this, and it's just cool, you know, sometimes all you need to motivate pieces like, oh, I saw this cool look and I want to capture it again.</p>

<p>Because of the visor on this character design, the eyes will be in shadow, not that we can't see the eyes.</p>

<p>Oh, the other thing that's funny is sometimes his belly shows, like right there. It's not that it's a raw belly, like maybe he'll have a sweater on, and then you can see that little shape there, that's fun.</p>

<p>So I'm going to draw that.</p>

<p>And so the point of this sort of drawing, what I was imagining would still make it valuable, is a <strong>warp perspective</strong>.</p>

<h3>Understanding Warp Perspective</h3>

<p>What is warp perspective?</p>

<p>A warp perspective is pretty much when, rather than having a singular point at which all of the lines converge, or several, or even three, which is what a three-point perspective would be, a warp perspective is closest to a one-point perspective but where the lens of the camera is adding a little <strong>curve</strong> to everything.</p>

<p>I know that what I'm about to say might go over most of your guys' heads, but I had an epiphany the other day that I thought was like, oh my god, I finally understand really how to achieve it in a way that makes things concrete.</p>

<p>When you look at a box that is eye level and perfectly straight on with you, then it will look like a square, because you just don't get an angle on the other side planes.</p>

<p>The reason I was thinking about it in these terms is because I saw a <strong>Kim Jung Gi</strong> video where he was drawing, and he was pointing out, so this is eye line, and I'm always thinking about what's above eye line and what's below eye line.</p>

<p>And I was like, I understand why that's useful for drawing things correctly, but on the other hand, like kind of so what? Like I didn't really see what I would use that for.</p>

<p>But when I was drawing these AC unit things, it reminded me that anything below eye line means you're going to see the top plane of that box. Anything above eye line, you're going to see the bottom plane of the box. And to the sides, you're going to see the side planes of that box.</p>

<h3>Adding More Information for Dynamism</h3>

<p>So the thing that I was like, oh, well, this is interesting to me and maybe not to too many other people, is that an image in which you can see <strong>multiple planes</strong> of a given object always is more <strong>dynamic</strong> and more interesting rather than seeing this flat-on orthographic view.</p>

<p>If we just have a scene where we see everything's top, left, and front plane, you know, I feel like this is like, I saw this view at the cafe I was at. It was just like, everything was like that.</p>

<p>And that's a normal kind of scene to view where you see just three planes of an object that are parallel to each other, not just randomly showing you another plane.</p>

<p>But if you have an image in which you can see <strong>all of the planes</strong>, except for the one facing away from you, then what that does is it adds way more information to the piece, and that creates more <strong>dynamism</strong>, and it creates more lines pointing to the center here rather than having that image where everything was to the side.</p>

<p>If you have an image in which you are starting to get this box as well as this box, as well as the under plane of this box, then you are having every single line leading you to the center eye line point.</p>

<h3>Applying Warp Perspective to the Thumbnail</h3>

<p>So exploring an art concept, high concept in that it's going to not matter to 99% of people, but because I think it's interesting, is the motivation to do a warp perspective piece here.</p>

<p>So it's a personal choice to explore it.</p>

<p>I have done warp before, but I've never done warp with that being something that's a consideration.</p>

<p>Like when I did before, it was like just to see if I could, just to understand how things work.</p>

<p>But doing it, knowing the reason that it works or the way to make it more effective is by showing more information, showing more planes, that's what's motivating this last thumbnail.</p>

<h3>Incorporating Elements and Composition</h3>

<p>So what does that mean?</p>

<p>It means I'm going to have <strong>AC units everywhere</strong>, guys, which was really the main goal. I don't really care if my wife and son are in the picture, just kidding.</p>

<p>So that means I need to see top planes, bottom planes, under planes, everybody. And that is kind of the goal.</p>

<p>I can still make it a scene with more story or more elements if I so choose, but primarily first I want to lay in that warped perspective.</p>

<h3>Adding Characters and Details</h3>

<p>One of the ways that this makes sense is I need to see under planes.</p>

<p>You know, if I don't see under planes, then I don't get that sense of perspective. And this is one of the things where if you don't see it, it doesn't count.</p>

<p>So you've got to show it for it to be something people can understand or feel.</p>

<p>So I had to put this under plane here of this building, maybe it's getting out a little bit, adding more AC vents.</p>

<p>Maybe this one's a storefront.</p>

<p>Right now, I'm not thinking story, I'm just trying to show my understanding of warp.</p>

<p>There can be characters here.</p>

<p>One thing that's kind of cool is thinking about <strong>people being planes or objects</strong>.</p>

<p>So if you need a box literally just to show perspective, if your character or the thing you're adding is sufficiently well-defined as having those different planes, then they can work just as well.</p>

<p>So if I have someone who's either wearing something that's not flowing but very rigid and revealing a lot of geometry on them, a lot of volumes, then that works.</p>

<p>So sometimes known objects like a hat or whatever can accomplish those sorts of things.</p>

<p>Having that really <strong>boxy backpack</strong> is a way to add those planes and reveal that information as well.</p>

<h3>Adding Story Elements</h3>

<p>I'm not sure what this character is, they're literally just another person with a hat.</p>

<p>Better idea: biker, back plane, and then back wheel here.</p>

<p>Oh, and I have references of the back of a motorcycle or bike.</p>

<p>Maybe I can reuse some of these characters.</p>

<p>Oh, I can use <strong>cat</strong> again.</p>

<p><strong>Plants</strong> - maybe this is a plant store in which there is a shelf for me to show off my plant knowledge.</p>

<h3>Finalizing the Thumbnail</h3>

<p>Really loose scribbles, this is for my reference to just get a handle on it.</p>

<p>So I feel like I sufficiently know what I'm doing with the space now.</p>

<p>Is there any story that I would want to add to this?</p>

<p>Them being the two main characters just walking and not really doing anything particularly dynamic or interacting with anyone else besides each other, I think what I got to do is have <strong>people looking at them</strong>.</p>

<p>I mean, that's one way to create that movement to have them be interesting, but it's also just a way to add some visual interest.</p>

<p>Should they all be <strong>cats</strong>?</p>

<p>The only reason why I feel like it's a good option is because if there's humans, they start to have their own story, or it starts to be a very photo-esque image, whereas I kind of want to keep the tone more <strong>playful</strong>.</p>

<p>So unless I make them like the intense biker guys, which is like they're more of a character, then they either stick out too much or are kind of bland.</p>

<p>We're going with cats, and then we're going with <strong>motorcycle cat biker cats</strong> who don't make any sense, but maybe that's fun.</p>

<p>It's a good sign: anytime you crack yourself up or think it's funny, then you're maybe doing something that will at least elicit a fun response from other people.</p>

<p>So if this is, again, almost a sequel to that Saturn Donuts piece I did previously where the cats are living their everyday life, but in this version, it's just like I'm gonna amp it up a little bit, so it's even more ridiculous.</p>

<p>So like this is like a <strong>shopkeeper</strong>.</p>

<p>The cat on the bike is definitely the best thing I have, so maybe I'll just have another one who's interacting with that other biker.</p>

<p>And yeah, they're just so much smaller that I can put a lot more in and have a lot more fun.</p>

<p>I can still technically throw in this two-point perspective thing by just having this road split, but it's not really about these side roads here.</p>

<p>I'm using this actually just to frame our character, but those tasty, tasty AC vents.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p>So there are my four thumbnails using what we've learned so far to come up with fun illustration ideas.</p>

<p>That concludes my lesson on thumbnails.</p>

<p>I think you can use thumbnails as a way to <strong>play with ideas</strong>, figure out ways to tell a story that use the things that you've been studying in your research.</p>

<p>As you saw here with my examples, it's a very <strong>organic process</strong>, drawing the things that appeal to you or include concepts that you're interested in exploring.</p>

<p>Any of those things can be steering the ship towards the final image you want to choose or draw.</p>

<p>And the best ones are usually the ones where you think you're having <strong>fun</strong> because it's sharing that fun with someone else.</p>

<p>Or maybe it's not fun, but maybe it's like <strong>attitude and spiciness</strong>, maybe that's what you want to show.</p>

<p>Getting to the essence of it here, figuring out the best way to show it.</p>

<p>Maybe you got to think about how they're being <strong>lit</strong> and how they are centered or placed in the scene so that the lines <strong>lead you to them</strong>.</p>

<p>That's what this rough stage is all about.</p>

<p>Because I am the client, I get to decide what we're going to draw.</p>

<p>I'll see you in the next one.</p>
