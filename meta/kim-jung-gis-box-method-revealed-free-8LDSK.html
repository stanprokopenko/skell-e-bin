<h2>What's in Premium?</h2>

<p>In the premium lesson, we dive into <strong>Kim Jung Gi's drawing technique</strong>, focusing on how "all his drawing is just these boxes." We explore how, after he understood the <strong>three-dimensional box</strong>, he started to improve a lot faster. Kim Jung Gi could fill walls with drawings because "all these boxes are in his mind." We discuss the importance of visualizing scenes with boxes, setting the horizon line, and breaking down complex images into simple shapes within a big box. The lesson emphasizes that "it comes down to how much you understand the three-dimensional box and how well you can draw it." We also share his advice on observing subjects objectively from more than one point of view and building spatial awareness to create dynamic drawings.</p>
