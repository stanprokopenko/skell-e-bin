<h2>Establishing the Side Plane of the Head</h2>

<p>Remember the side plane from the roadmap lesson. Identify four points for the side plane: <strong>temple</strong>, <strong>back of skull</strong>, <strong>hairline</strong>, and <strong>base of the nose</strong>. Wrap the hairline to the back of the head and locate the base of the nose.</p>

<h2>Placing Key Facial Landmarks</h2>

<p>Once the side plane is established, place the <strong>ear</strong>, <strong>jaw</strong>, and <strong>cheek</strong>. Wrap the hairline around and across to determine height. Find the base of the nose to determine the height for cutting, temple, and back of the skull.</p>

<h2>Refining the Shape and Understanding the Planes</h2>

<p>Shave down big forms to refine the shape. The planes of the head get wider towards the back, causing a narrowing from the forehead to the back of the head. Split the ellipse and side plane into quarters. Relate points by splitting top to bottom and side to middle. The back quarter is the ear shape, often a simple C curve. Match the sitter's jaw length and quality of break from the angle down to the chin. Use a basic Loomis curve for the jaw, from the top of the ear to the corner of the chin. Understand the real bone structure for the cheek.</p>

<h2>Developing the Eye Socket</h2>

<p>Develop the sockets as a large plane. Represent the skull's forward and receding planes in perspective. The eye socket structure tapers back, with the eye sitting on top or outside. Use simple perspective language to represent the eye socket. Know the brow and bottom of the sockets, then connect the dots. Indicate the width of the temple and create the fall or drop back of the socket. Hatch the recessed surface to understand light and shadow around the eye.</p>

<h2>Constructing the Nose</h2>

<p>The nose begins at the end of the keystone. Move into the nasal saddle, which is the top of the housing around the nasal aperture. On top of the nasal saddle, there are two types of cartilage and a piece of structural fat that extends the nose outward. Determine the width of the nose, starting with the part flush to the face and narrowing to the tip. Measure the distance between the base and the peak of the cartilage. Connect the dots to form the structure of the nose.</p>

<h2>Drawing the Mouth and Chin</h2>

<p>Draw an egg or ball shape that goes roughly to the midline of the eye. Use the surface line of the denture sphere to organize features like the nasolabial furrow. Draw lips with depth to reflect the bite, considering the rounded shape when eating. Draw a small egg shape for the chin, setting up the basic construction of the face.</p>

<h2>Practicing Perspective and Proportion</h2>

<p>Develop perspective with front and side planes. Practice with figures seen from different angles, ensuring perspective matches. Use symmetry lines to ensure even proportions and foreshortening. Map out useful surfaces for lighting or painting. Customize based on specific skull qualities, like male versus female. Gradually build up lines, allowing for creativity and error. Use a light to dark touch in drawings, starting lighter and gradually getting darker.</p>
