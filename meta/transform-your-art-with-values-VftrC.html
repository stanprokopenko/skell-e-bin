<h2>The Importance of Value</h2>

<p>Values are essential in making your drawings look three-dimensional and creating the illusion of form. While lines are useful, learning how to effectively use values can transform your art. A <strong>value</strong> is simply how light or dark something is.</p>

<h2>Value and Color</h2>

<p>In reality, we see light affecting form, represented by colors made up of <strong>hue</strong>, <strong>chroma</strong>, and <strong>value</strong>.</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Hue</strong>: The color family, like yellow, red, or blue.</li>

<li><strong>Chroma</strong>: How pure or gray the color is.</li>

<li><strong>Value</strong>: The lightness or darkness of a color from white to black.</li>

</ul>

<p>For artists, <strong>value</strong> is the most important component of color.</p>

<h2>The Value Scale</h2>

<p>Imagine a scale from 0 to 10, where 0 is the darkest black and 10 is the brightest white.</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Munsell Value Scale</strong>: A system measuring light to organize color and value.</li>

<li>Artists break down values into steps to make them easier to manage.</li>

</ul>

<p>You can use a limited value scale in your drawings, using fewer values to represent light and shadow.</p>

<h2>Value Sources</h2>

<p>Four factors determine the values we see:</p>

<ol>

<li><strong>Local Value</strong>: The inherent lightness or darkness of an object.</li>

<li><strong>Light on Form</strong>: How light affects an object based on its form.</li>

</ol>

<p>As a beginner, focus on <strong>local value</strong> and <strong>light on form</strong>.</p>

<h3>Local Value</h3>

<p>Local value refers to the inherent value of a thing, regardless of lighting. For example, hair is typically darker than skin.</p>

<h3>Light on Form</h3>

<p>Light affects an object unevenly based on its form. Parts facing the light become lighter, while parts turning away become darker. Together with local value, this creates the illusion of depth.</p>

<h2>Practice Tips</h2>

<p>Start by practicing drawing without color. Focus on using values to represent light and form. Once you're comfortable with values, you can introduce color to enhance your art.</p>
