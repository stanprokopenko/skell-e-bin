<p><strong>Importance of Measuring and Observation</strong></p>

<p>Accurate measuring is crucial to avoid errors in drawing. I constantly measure and double-check my work to minimize mistakes. Observing proportions is essential, especially since features like ear and eye alignment change with head tilt. I rely on careful observation to ensure accuracy. Using a mirror helps me see my work with fresh eyes, allowing me to catch mistakes that I might otherwise miss.</p>

<p><strong>Techniques for Improved Drawing</strong></p>

<p>Squinting is a technique I use to simplify shapes and see them more clearly. Drawing upside down is another method that helps activate the right side of the brain, promoting objective observation. I often test my skills by drawing from photos, which helps me improve. Comparing my freehand drawing to a grid drawing allows me to assess accuracy and strive to draw as well without a grid as I can with one.</p>

<p><strong>Personal Drawing Challenges</strong></p>

<p>I have a tendency to impose my own features onto others' faces when drawing. Additionally, I often make noses too long, so I counteract this by measuring again. Recognizing these tendencies helps me improve my accuracy.</p>

<p><strong>Tools and Methods</strong></p>

<p>To prevent charcoal from mixing with paint, I use spray fixative. Pre-mixing colors with a limited palette is part of my process for efficient painting. This allows me to paint quickly without overthinking. I plan to spray fix the drawing before starting to paint, ensuring a clean surface.</p>

<p><strong>Artistic Goals and Inspirations</strong></p>

<p>My goal is to draw as well without a grid as I can with one. I'm inspired by my art teacher's ability to draw objectively. I aim to paint with meaningful strokes that tell a story, and maintaining historical accuracy is important to me, even in details like how a scarf is worn.</p>

<p><strong>Painting Process</strong></p>

<p>Pre-mixing paints is a step I take for quick and efficient painting. Once the colors are ready, I begin the painting process. For practice, I might paint both the freehand and grid drawings, which helps me refine my skills.</p>
