<p>My name is Eric Gist, but you'll most often see me credited as <strong>EMGIST</strong>. I've worked on a lot of different projects in the comic book industry. Some of my favorite pieces include covers for <strong>Fantastic Four</strong>, <strong>Iron Fist</strong>, <strong>Wolverine</strong>, and <strong>Hulk</strong>. I've mostly done variant covers—the secondary covers for comic books.</p>

<p>I've been working in comics for about 15 years. My first cover was in 2007. I started working with Marvel around 2016, beginning with a series of covers for the <strong>Haunted Mansion</strong> series. My first real Marvel character cover was for their anniversary issue of <strong>Crazy</strong> in 2019.</p>

<h2>My Favorite Works</h2>

<p>Picking a favorite piece is tough because I like a lot of them for different reasons. It's probably a tie between my <strong>Fantastic Four</strong> cover and my <strong>Hulk</strong> cover.</p>

<p>The <strong>Hulk</strong> cover was really cool because it was an action scene, which I don't do a ton of. It was a classic fight scene between <strong>Wolverine</strong> and <strong>Hulk</strong>, which I think almost every comic artist wants to do at one time or another. It was a lot of fun, and to make it even better, it featured a <strong>zombie Wolverine</strong>! That was pretty cool because I'm kind of known for doing zombies as well.</p>

<p>The <strong>Fantastic Four</strong> cover was a lot of fun because there was a little bit more storytelling involved. You've got more characters, and they each have their own characteristics. The whole family dynamic and trying to work that into a single image was a good challenge and something I really enjoyed.</p>

<h2>Starting in Comics</h2>

<p>The first thing I wanted to do in art was <strong>draw comic books</strong>. I was always into comics from the time I was a little kid. I remember being about eight years old, trying to get everything I could. I wanted to do interiors, and during the '90s boom, everyone was excited about comics. That was when comics started to become a bit more mainstream.</p>

<p>I worked on doing interiors, but I was terrible. I did submissions every month to all the companies and got <strong>tons of rejection letters</strong>—some of which I still have. Then I started training with <strong>Jeff Watts</strong> and found out that I had more of a knack for <strong>single-image storytelling</strong>.</p>

<p>I still loved the genre of comics but wanted to get more into painting and single-image storytelling. So I started pursuing <strong>covers</strong>. It took me about ten years to get to where I was good enough, and then about another five to catch on doing them.</p>

<p>I got into comics by taking my work to <strong>Comic-Con</strong>, starting off showing interior samples, but then realizing I had more of a knack for single-image cover stuff. It's also just really tough to do painted interiors; there aren't too many guys that do it, and the ones that do are just amazing.</p>

<h2>Developing My Style</h2>

<p>Broadly speaking, my style is often dictated by how I feel about the characters—not in terms of liking or disliking them, but more about how I interpret them, and I try to get that to come across in the image.</p>

<p>If there's something I'm known for, it's definitely <strong>deep shadows</strong>, <strong>high contrast</strong>, and <strong>moodier stuff</strong>—kind of a <strong>noir</strong> or, for lack of a better term, a <strong>horror feel</strong>. Something a little bit darker is what I'm known for.</p>

<p>In the last year or two, I've been branching out into some <strong>brighter-colored stuff</strong>, and I've also been getting asked to do brighter characters. For example, <strong>Fantastic Four</strong> isn't really known for being dark and moody, so that was a lot of fun. I went in a more <strong>Norman Rockwell</strong> direction with that; he's one of my favorite artists of all time.</p>

<p>With my <strong>Iron Fist</strong> cover, I went in a brighter-colored direction, showing the <strong>history of the character</strong>. Certainly, I could find some dark covers to do with that character—he's not a dark character—but in this one, I wanted to show the <strong>brighter side</strong>, the literal <strong>passing of the torch</strong> in a way with that character.</p>

<p>I'm known for the darker, moodier stuff, and that makes up the lion's share of my work. But I've been privileged to be asked to do some stuff that's a bit out of my wheelhouse, which I really like because I don't want to get stuck doing the same thing over and over again. I want to be one of those guys that gets asked to do just about everything.</p>

<h2>Inspiration and Influences</h2>

<p>I want something that <strong>stands out in people's minds</strong>. There are a lot of artists that I admire, especially from the past but also many working today. The artists I really pick out are those that have a balance between an <strong>iconic image</strong> and storytelling.</p>

<p>Your initial read on their work is something that you're never going to forget. It's an image that's <strong>burned into your head</strong>, like the first time you come home to see your mom after your first day ever going to school—it's that thing that deep in your soul you'll never forget. That's the kind of painting I want to make—the thing that sticks with you day after day, week after week.</p>

<h2>Advice for Aspiring Artists</h2>

<h3>Specialize and Then Branch Out</h3>

<p>That's a tough question, but to me, it depends on what you want to do. I would definitely <strong>specialize</strong> at first. <strong>Get really, really good at one thing</strong>. You're going to be way better off than being mediocre at three different things.</p>

<p>As far as what to specialize in, that's going to depend on where your fire is and, like with me, where your natural abilities lie. Once you feel like you've got a good handle on that, you can start to branch out.</p>

<p>Comics definitely seem to be heading in the direction of the <strong>well-rounded artist</strong>. When I was a kid, there were pencilers, inkers, and colorists, and that's what you did. Now, those lines are getting a lot blurrier. I think the art directors and editors like to see someone who can do it all, so it's just sort of <strong>one-stop shopping</strong> for them.</p>

<p>But I would say get really good at one thing first. Then, as you get yourself established, you can start maybe inking yourself. If you want to do your own book, maybe then you can start coloring yourself.</p>

<p>It's good to know a little bit of everything. I always tell people to <strong>be a jack of all trades, master of one</strong>. It's good to at least be familiar with all of it. That way, when you're communicating with your inker, your colorist, or even your writer, you can come from a standpoint of knowledge and not ignorance.</p>

<h3>Getting Better at Making Covers</h3>

<p>To improve at making covers specifically, I would say <strong>study the people that are good at it</strong>. Don't limit yourself to just contemporary artists. Go back and look at cover artists—not just comic cover artists—but cover artists throughout the long history of illustration.</p>

<p>Also, study narrative painters going back even before print. I look at people like <strong>Bouguereau</strong>, <strong>Caravaggio</strong>, and <strong>Rembrandt</strong>. I look at their work as much or more than I do people who are working today. I think it's one of the things that sets my work apart a little bit—it has sort of a <strong>timeless feel</strong> to it, and that's what I strive for.</p>

<p>I don't want my work to feel trendy or modern, but at the same time, I don't want it to feel dated. I really strive for that <strong>"never looked new but never gets old"</strong> type of feel to my artwork.</p>

<p>I would encourage artists to look at a wide variety of influences. Beyond that, <strong>work on your fundamentals</strong> and <strong>make covers</strong>. If you want to get better at golf, go play golf. If you want to do covers, make covers. <strong>Make some bad covers</strong>. Get them out of your system. Do a lot of them. That's how you're going to get better.</p>

<p>But that's still going to be built on good, solid <strong>fundamentals</strong>. So find somewhere you can learn that. Study your fundamentals, study hard, have a wide variety of influences, and make covers. That's how you're going to get good.</p>

<h3>The Importance of Fundamentals</h3>

<p>The fundamentals in my mind would be:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Figure drawing</strong>: This includes basic drawing, fundamental forms, fundamental lighting, and anatomy.</li>

<li><strong>Color theory</strong></li>

<li><strong>Perspective</strong></li>

<li><strong>Composition</strong></li>

</ul>

<p>When you're talking about being good, they're all pretty important. You can't really put one on top of the other, other than, like I said, <strong>figure</strong> is obviously going to be more important because it's comics. It's about figures; it's about people first and foremost.</p>

<p>If you can draw a <strong>cool, dynamic figure</strong>, you can get away with a lot of sins in other areas. Not that I'm encouraging that, but you're going to get more work being able to draw a really great Spider-Man and a mediocre car than you are being able to draw a great car and a mediocre Spider-Man.</p>

<p>If you're going into sci-fi, that might shift a little bit—you need to be able to do a good spaceship, so things like <strong>perspective</strong> are going to be a bit more important.</p>

<p>You can break it down infinitely and expand on it infinitely. If you're going to break it down into just those categories I mentioned, I would say <strong>figure</strong> and <strong>composition</strong>—taking the figure and putting it into an interesting composition. And then, like I said, being <strong>good enough at the other things that people don't notice</strong>.</p>

<p>That's probably the big thing: <strong>just don't be bad at them</strong>, because that can be very distracting. But if your figure is cool enough and your composition is cool enough, you can let a lot slide in the other areas. Again, not that I would encourage that, but you can definitely let those things slide a little bit.</p>

<h3>Avoid Forcing Style</h3>

<p>I wouldn't necessarily avoid anything as far as studying it or looking at it, because I don't think there's any such thing as bad knowledge, bad information, or bad influences. It's all about how you're going to use those.</p>

<p>Sometimes, what people would call a bad influence can actually add uniqueness to your good work. I maybe would avoid getting too caught up in <strong>forcing style</strong>. <strong>Don't try to force it</strong>, because I think that's going to end up feeling false. It's going to end up making you a second-rate version of another artist.</p>

<p>That's going to happen to a certain degree in the beginning of your career, but I would not force that style. <strong>Don't try too much to be someone else</strong>. Have your influences, but let them find their way into your work organically.</p>

<p>That would probably be the biggest thing: <strong>be yourself</strong>. The best way to be yourself is to <strong>not be other people</strong>.</p>

<h3>Embrace Limitations</h3>

<p>Of course, it's limiting to try and fit as much of a story as you can into one image or represent an entire plotline with one image—but <strong>limiting in a good way</strong>.</p>

<p>As you've probably already noticed, I'm a big film fan. One of the things I don't like about modern movies is that there's <strong>no limitation to the visuals</strong>. You can always hit it with the money hose and have some brilliant CG artists visualize pretty much anything that you want them to visualize.</p>

<p>Some of my favorite movies from back when I was a kid, like <strong>Alien</strong>—one of the reasons <strong>Alien</strong> was so great is because it was a dude in a rubber suit, and so they didn't want to really show him full figure that much and break the illusion. So he's hidden in shadows.</p>

<p>It's kind of the same way in art—it makes you <strong>be clever</strong>. It makes you <strong>think through a problem</strong> and come up with an interesting solution rather than just putting on there exactly what you want to put on there.</p>

<p>I think sometimes <strong>limitations or restrictions can breed creativity</strong> because you have to find a way around. You have to find a creative solution, and the more of a creative solution you have to come up with, the more likely you are to be original.</p>

<p>The more limitations that are put on you, you have to come up with an original or creative way of doing things. It makes you <strong>dig a little bit deeper</strong>, and I think anything that makes you dig deeper is great for creativity.</p>

<p>That's why <strong>thumbnails</strong> are such an important part of the process. A friend of mine once said that <strong>the first five thumbnails you do are always someone else's idea</strong>. You have to get to that five-thumbnail point, and usually, the way mine breaks down is I do five thumbnails that are usually someone else's idea, and I just don't realize it. It's just things I've seen before and are stored up in my head.</p>

<p>Then another five that are bad ideas. Then finally, about that tenth sketch, you start getting into something that is somewhat <strong>unique to you and good</strong>. That's why it's important to get to that point of doing 10, 15, 20 sketches and not limiting yourself to just your first idea.</p>

<p>As you get more experienced, you can leapfrog those first five to a certain degree because you've drawn them before. You might come up with the idea, but you don't even bother sketching it down because you're like, "Oh, I've rejected that before because it was boring." You start skipping over those just from experience.</p>

<h3>What I Wish I Knew Earlier</h3>

<p>I started doing comic covers when I already had quite a bit of knowledge and experience under my belt. I'd worked in <strong>video games</strong> for about five years, and I'd done illustration in other areas for about five years.</p>

<p>I just <strong>wish I knew how good you had to be</strong>. That's the big thing. Each level that you go up, especially in comics, there's sort of this tier system. You'll start off working for some third- or fourth-tier companies. It's not that those companies aren't good or that you're not doing good work, but you aren't in front of the broad populace as much.</p>

<p>If you're doing covers for a book that's selling 4,000 copies, it's a lot different than doing covers for a book that's selling 80,000 copies. You just want to make sure that you're <strong>as good as you possibly can be</strong> before you're getting broad exposure to a comparatively large audience.</p>

<p>I didn't rush it, but I wish I would have known <strong>how good you had to be</strong>, if that makes sense. I was 17 or 18 years old when I was doing pages and submitting them to Marvel and DC and Image, which was just ridiculous. But I didn't know any better, and it didn't hurt at all.</p>

<p>I thought I had a legitimate chance, and I look back on that stuff and realize how ridiculous it was. Maybe that was good. Maybe I benefited from my own ignorance because it <strong>kept me motivated</strong> and <strong>kept me producing work</strong>. It gave me a fake deadline—that every month I wanted to submit these samples to these companies.</p>

<p>Here I am, 20 or 30 years later, and I'm doing covers. I still look at my work, and sometimes they'll go out the door, and I'll just go, <strong>"I wish that was better."</strong> Because it's on the rack next to people like <strong>Alex Ross</strong>, <strong>Totino Tedesco</strong>, and all these great cover artists. I don't want to say you're competing with them, but you're definitely <strong>competing for sales</strong> with those people.</p>

<p>You don't want to make it all about the sales, but it's part of the job. Your job is to <strong>sell comics</strong>. To me, my job is to do a good image, but for whatever company you're working for, it's about selling books. You have to be able to sell books, and you want to make sure that you're <strong>good enough to sell books</strong>.</p>
