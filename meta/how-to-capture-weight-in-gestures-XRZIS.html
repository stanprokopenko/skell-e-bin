<h2>Starting with Gesture and Idea</h2>

<p>Now that I've set up the big, broad strokes, I focus on the <strong>gesture</strong> and think about the <strong>idea</strong> as prominent, not about the subject as something to be copied or captured. I aim to communicate the essence, not just replicate what I see.</p>

<h2>Introducing Weight and Balance</h2>

<p>As I progress, I shift towards the <strong>what</strong> of what I'm seeing. If I'm trying to capture a feeling or a sense of realism about the figure, I consider principles that will get me closer to the mark. For me, the next focus is <strong>weight and balance</strong>.</p>

<p>My idea is often about communicating the <strong>naturalistic realism of the body</strong>. Your idea could be entirely different, but it's essential to pair your concept with appropriate execution.</p>

<h2>The Eight Parts of the Body</h2>

<p>To study weight and balance, I'd like to take you through a <strong>proportion chart</strong>. This chart helps us organize and understand what I'll describe as the <strong>eight parts of the body</strong>:</p>

<ol>

<li><strong>Head</strong></li>

<li><strong>Rib cage</strong></li>

<li><strong>Pelvis</strong></li>

<li><strong>Spine</strong></li>

<li><strong>Two arms</strong></li>

<li><strong>Two legs</strong></li>

</ol>

<p>I'm not going into strict detail about landmarks or where muscles go. Instead, I want to give you the big ideas of these parts and their organization.</p>

<h2>Creating a Proportion Chart</h2>

<p>Here's how I like to create a proportion chart:</p>

<ol>

<li><strong>Start with a line</strong> for the head and another for the feet. This creates an arbitrary scale.</li>

<li><strong>Divide the distance</strong> between the head and feet into halves and thirds. I use halves and thirds because that's about all my brain can handle mathematically.</li>

<li><strong>Halve the space</strong> to find the midpoint of the figure.</li>

<li><strong>Divide each half into halves</strong> again, giving you four sections.</li>

<li><strong>Halve each of those sections</strong> once more to get eight equal parts. This represents an <strong>eight-head figure</strong>, an idealized proportion.</li>

</ol>

<h3>Front, Side, and Back Views</h3>

<p>I like to draw three views:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Front view</strong></li>

<li><strong>Side view</strong></li>

<li><strong>Back view</strong></li>

</ul>

<p>Labeling these helps organize my thoughts and allows me to see how the parts relate in different perspectives.</p>

<h2>Understanding the Rib Cage and Pelvis</h2>

<p>Between the head and the midpoint, I divide the space into <strong>thirds</strong>:</p>

<ul>

<li>The <strong>rib cage</strong> starts at the first third and ends at the second third.</li>

<li>The <strong>pelvis</strong> is generally one head tall and two heads wide.</li>

</ul>

<p>To determine the <strong>width of the rib cage</strong>:</p>

<ul>

<li>For the front and back views, it's about <strong>two heads wide</strong>.</li>

<li>For the side view, it's the <strong>width of one head</strong>.</li>

</ul>

<p>I also consider the <strong>tilt of the rib cage and pelvis</strong>:</p>

<ul>

<li>The rib cage often has a slight tilt backward.</li>

<li>The pelvis tilts forward, especially in women, creating an asymmetrical balance.</li>

</ul>

<h2>The Spine and Its Curves</h2>

<p>The <strong>spine</strong> is crucial for weight and balance. It has <strong>three parts</strong>:</p>

<ol>

<li><strong>Cervical spine</strong> (7 vertebrae) – pushes the head forward.</li>

<li><strong>Thoracic spine</strong> (12 vertebrae) – angles backward.</li>

<li><strong>Lumbar spine</strong> (5 vertebrae) – angles forward into the pelvis.</li>

</ol>

<p>I visualize the spine as an <strong>S-curve</strong>, with each section contributing to the body's balance. This natural imbalance creates the upright posture we have.</p>

<h3>Importance of the Spine's Curvature</h3>

<p>Understanding the spine's curvature helps explain:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Movement and balance</strong> in the figure.</li>

<li>The <strong>relationship between the masses</strong> (head, rib cage, pelvis).</li>

<li>How to create <strong>naturalistic and lifelike drawings</strong>.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Weight and Balance in the Body</h2>

<p>The body is a <strong>chaotic tower</strong> of balances. Our upright qualities come from a constant state of imbalance. Here's how different parts contribute:</p>

<ul>

<li>The <strong>head</strong> leans forward due to the cervical spine.</li>

<li>The <strong>rib cage</strong> angles backward to counterbalance the head.</li>

<li>The <strong>lumbar spine</strong> curves forward to balance the rib cage.</li>

</ul>

<p>This <strong>asymmetrical balance</strong> is essential for creating a sense of naturalism in our drawings.</p>

<h2>Proportions of the Legs</h2>

<p>Moving into the legs:</p>

<ul>

<li>The <strong>great trochanter</strong> (hip joint) is about <strong>two-thirds</strong> down the pelvis.</li>

<li>The <strong>knee</strong> is located at about <strong>five and a half heads</strong> down (in a seven and a half head figure) or at <strong>six heads</strong> down (in an eight-head figure).</li>

</ul>

<p>The <strong>femur</strong> (thigh bone):</p>

<ul>

<li>Has a <strong>J-curve</strong>, especially noticeable from the side.</li>

<li>Is longer than in most mammals, making humans slower but allowing upright posture.</li>

</ul>

<p>The <strong>lower leg</strong>:</p>

<ul>

<li>Forms an <strong>S-curve</strong> with the femur, acting as a <strong>shock absorber</strong>.</li>

<li>The <strong>ankle</strong> ends at the last half head, which is further divided into thirds for detailed proportions.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Asymmetry and Design in Limbs</h2>

<p>The limbs exhibit asymmetry:</p>

<ul>

<li>The <strong>leg</strong> can be seen as a <strong>lightning bolt</strong> shape, with in and out movements.</li>

<li>The <strong>arm</strong> has a <strong>carrying angle</strong>, more pronounced in women, causing the wrist to align with the great trochanter.</li>

</ul>

<p>Understanding these asymmetries helps in creating dynamic and realistic figures.</p>

<h2>Observations on Gender Differences</h2>

<p>There are notable differences between male and female proportions:</p>

<ul>

<li>

<p><strong>Women</strong> tend to have:</p>

<ul>

<li>A <strong>greater tilt</strong> in the pelvis.</li>

<li>A <strong>vertical belly button</strong> due to the angle and abdominal stretch.</li>

<li>A <strong>more pronounced carrying angle</strong> in the arms.</li>

</ul>

</li>

<li>

<p><strong>Men</strong> tend to have:</p>

<ul>

<li>A <strong>less tilted pelvis</strong>, resulting in a <strong>horizontal belly button</strong>.</li>

<li><strong>Less pronounced</strong> asymmetries in certain areas.</li>

</ul>

</li>

</ul>

<p>These differences can affect the overall <strong>story and character</strong> of the figure.</p>

<h2>The Importance of Understanding Form</h2>

<p>By understanding these principles:</p>

<ul>

<li>We see that the body's <strong>form reveals functionality</strong>.</li>

<li>We can create drawings that are <strong>lifelike and natural</strong>.</li>

<li>We avoid drawing figures that are <strong>stiff or symmetrical</strong>, which can look unnatural.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Applying Proportions to Gesture Drawing</h2>

<p>When doing gesture drawings:</p>

<ul>

<li>Keep in mind the <strong>big ideas</strong> of placement and proportion.</li>

<li>Use <strong>curves, rhythms, and asymmetries</strong> to organize the figure.</li>

<li>Don't get overburdened with details, focus on the <strong>overall balance and movement</strong>.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Contour and Anatomy</h2>

<p>The contour of the muscles and bones reflects the underlying asymmetry:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Active and passive muscles</strong> create variations in the contour.</li>

<li>Even the arm's musculature shows <strong>asymmetrical relationships</strong>.</li>

<li>Recognizing these helps in drawing more <strong>convincing gestures</strong>.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Common Proportion Errors</h2>

<p>Be aware of common mistakes:</p>

<ul>

<li>Drawing the <strong>gluteus maximus</strong> (the largest muscle in the body) too small or too high.</li>

<li>Making <strong>hands too short</strong> , they should end halfway down the length of the femur.</li>

</ul>

<p>Understanding <strong>weight, balance, and proportions</strong> is essential in figure drawing. By studying the <strong>eight parts of the body</strong> and their relationships, we gain insights that enhance our gestures and overall drawings. Always focus on the <strong>why</strong> behind your drawing choices, and let the underlying structure inform your art.</p>
