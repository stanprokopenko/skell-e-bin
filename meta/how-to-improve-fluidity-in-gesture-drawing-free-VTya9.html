<h2>What's in Premium?</h2>

<p>In this premium lesson, we provide a comprehensive critique on the <strong>shape method</strong> for gesture drawing. You'll learn how to overcome common challenges like getting <strong>stuck on individual shapes</strong> and losing the overall flow of your drawings. We discuss techniques to <strong>carry through the center line</strong> for better fluidity, find and <strong>exaggerate tilts</strong> to enhance gesture, and ensure <strong>perspective connections</strong> to unify your work.</p>

<p>The lesson covers using <strong>asymmetry</strong> to break unwanted symmetry, relating arms and legs across the body with <strong>relational rhythms</strong>, and incorporating <strong>anatomy and form</strong> to improve transitions and add depth. We also emphasize the importance of avoiding over-reliance on contours, using <strong>negative space</strong> to check proportions, and how the shape method aids in <strong>stylizing and character design</strong>.</p>

<p>Finally, we guide you on moving from the shape method into <strong>light and shadow</strong>, understanding anatomy as basic forms, and mapping light and shadow to bring naturalism to your drawings.</p>
