<h2>Using Four Colors</h2>

<p>I like to use a <strong>four-color</strong> ballpoint pen (green, red, black, and blue) because each color has its own <strong>value</strong> and reacts differently when I smudge it:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Green</strong> has the lightest value. I use it for subtle details or backgrounds.  </li>

<li><strong>Red</strong> is warm. I often outline with red first, then pass over it with black to create contrasts and cooler tones elsewhere.  </li>

<li><strong>Black</strong> is versatile for outlines and darker shading.  </li>

<li><strong>Blue</strong> smudges more easily than black. It’s helpful when I want to go really soft and blurry with shadows.</li>

</ul>

<p>I sometimes <strong>lick my finger</strong> or <strong>pre-wet</strong> the paper to help with blending. When we wet the surface, the pen’s ink seeps in more, creating <strong>thicker lines</strong> or softer edges. I don’t mind if the paper tears a bit. Thicker paper adds texture and supports heavier smudging.</p>

<h2>Smudging and Shading</h2>

<p>When I shade, I often <strong>feather</strong> in some lines and then smudge to form a <strong>core shadow</strong>. Smudging does the work of blending values for me. If I want a <strong>strong highlight</strong>, I darken the light side around it, so the highlight stands out. I also use a <strong>tissue</strong> to wipe off the pen’s tip when it clots or to brush ink onto the paper in a subtle wash.</p>

<h2>Drawing Basic Shapes</h2>

<h3>Sphere</h3>

<p>I start by outlining the sphere lightly with a chosen color, then place a <strong>cast shadow</strong> beneath it. I like to follow the sphere’s contour lines to suggest its form. After I draw a few soft lines, I smudge them to create the <strong>core shadow</strong>, letting the gradient appear naturally. If I want a highlight, I keep one area clean and make the surrounding values darker so the highlight pops.</p>

<h3>Cylinder</h3>

<p>I outline the ellipse on top and the base, then add a cast shadow. If the <strong>light source</strong> is on one side, the shadow will stretch in the opposite direction. I apply broad strokes along the curve, then smudge to get a smooth transition. By building darker tones on the side away from the light, I create a distinct light side, core shadow, and reflective light.</p>

<h3>Box</h3>

<p>I draw the box with simple lines, then figure out where the light hits. Each plane has its own value. I make one plane darker, smudge a bit, and leave the top or front plane lighter. An <strong>occlusion shadow</strong> tucked beneath the box makes it feel heavy and grounded. If I want beveled edges, I simply add narrower planes and keep the same light and shadow rules consistent.</p>

<h3>Cone</h3>

<p>For a cone, I draw the circular base and outline the sides tapering to the tip. The cast shadow fans roughly in the direction of the light source. I outline the side, smudge the area that should be darker, and let the <strong>core shadow</strong> form. A line can help define that core shadow before I blend it. Sometimes the paper tears, but I go over it again to smooth out the edges.</p>

<h2>Additional Techniques</h2>

<p>I like to vary my <strong>line weight</strong>. Thicker, bolder lines come forward, while thinner lines recede. A ballpoint pen can easily switch between thin and thick lines depending on my pressure. If I want a <strong>softer wash</strong>, I might wet a tissue with ink and brush it across the drawing to deepen or unify values.</p>

<p>Overall, my drawing process is <strong>part drawing, part painting</strong>, since I rely heavily on smudging, blending, and adjusting edges. I don’t shy away from rough textures or minor paper tears, I think they add character.</p>

<p>I hope these demonstrations help you understand how I <strong>render basic shapes</strong>. Feel free to experiment with different pressures, pens, and papers to find the look and texture you like best.</p>
