<p>I'm practicing the gestural perspective project, starting with architecture. I decided to do a treehouse. I like the idea of incorporating an organic form that can have some obvious gesture. Adding a treehouse can balance structure and gesture, with the structural elements either following or contrasting the gesture of the tree.</p>

<h2>Concept Sketches</h2>

<p>I began with some concept sketches to figure out what my treehouse would look like. I used an Olo marker for broad strokes to think about the overall shape and silhouette quickly. Here are a few ideas I tried out:</p>

<ol>

<li><strong>Twisted Trunk</strong>: A tree with a twisted, expressive trunk. I sketched a basic block on top of it.</li>

<li><strong>More Gesture</strong>: A tree with more dynamic shapes and roots in a zigzag pattern. I leaned the house a bit to continue the gesture.</li>

<li><strong>Connected Houses</strong>: Two houses connected by a bridge, supported by multiple tree trunks.</li>

<li><strong>Vertical Stacking</strong>: Houses stacked vertically with a flowing gesture, supported by a single tree trunk.</li>

<li><strong>Multiple Trunks</strong>: Four houses supported by several vertical tree trunks.</li>

</ol>

<h2>Exploring Gesture in Design</h2>

<p>I focused on adding gesture to the tree trunk and treehouse. I experimented with different shapes and forms to balance structure and gesture. For example, I tried leaning the house and adding elements like railings to protect kids from falling off.</p>

<h2>Refining the Design</h2>

<p>I selected the most successful concept sketch and started a full-page version with perspective considerations. I decided on a viewpoint looking up at the treehouse, as it’s a tall structure and we’d typically view it from the ground.</p>

<h2>Perspective and Composition</h2>

<p>I mapped out the overall composition with a red pencil, keeping things loose and light. I thought about the perspective of each element, ensuring the design followed a coherent vanishing point. I used the blob approach to sketch the houses, considering the bottom planes and three-quarter angles.</p>

<h2>Adding Details</h2>

<p>I switched to a graphite pencil to clean up the drawing. I considered line weight and the thickness of elements, like the roof's thickness. I added texture and small details to enhance the drawing, such as little boards for climbing and the texture of the tree trunk.</p>

<h2>Final Touches</h2>

<p>I ensured the design was cohesive and balanced, adding personality and context to the treehouse. I thought about practical elements like ladders and doors. For example, I added a ladder behind a branch and a door slightly off-center.</p>

<p>I hope you have fun with this project as I have. This process can be used in designing for children's books or concept designs for movies. The goal is to make everyone excited about the world you're creating. All the little details and gestures help make it more fun and engaging. Next, I'll be working on gestural torso boxes. See you then!</p>
