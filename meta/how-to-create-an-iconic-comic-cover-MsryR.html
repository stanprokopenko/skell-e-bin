<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>Alright, so this is your final assignment. This is your chance to put <strong>everything you've learned so far</strong> together in one place: <strong>the comic cover</strong>. A great cover captures the eye, tells a story, and hooks a reader into picking up the issue.</p>

<h2>The Importance of a Great Cover</h2>

<p>Your challenge is to create an <strong>unforgettable cover</strong> for a new issue number one. The cover is where you go all out. You show off your best work to grab a potential reader's attention. Everything you've learned in this course is an essential element needed to design a cover that will stand out on the shelf and sell the book.</p>

<h2>What Makes a Great Cover?</h2>

<p>Covers need to <strong>feel iconic</strong>, be <strong>true to the characters</strong>, and reveal something about the character or communicate an interesting twist within their story. Try to <strong>entice the reader by posing a question</strong> with your comic composition, something that makes it impossible not to pick up off the shelf.</p>

<h2>Assignment Details</h2>

<h3>Choose a Prompt</h3>

<p>We're going to give you <strong>four prompts to choose from</strong>. There's no standard way that a cover artist gets their assignment. Usually, editors speak to the artist about what's going on in the story and either give the artist a concept or a more fleshed-out direction on where to go with the cover. But you rarely get to read the comic before making the cover. So, go into the assignment description, choose your favorite prompt, and <strong>make it your own</strong>.</p>

<h3>Media and Tools</h3>

<p>For this assignment, you can use <strong>any media</strong> you want. You can <strong>paint traditionally</strong> like Eric, use <strong>digital tools</strong> the entire way, or <strong>mix and match</strong> traditional pen and ink with digital coloring. The tools don't matter as much as the <strong>final result</strong>.</p>

<h3>Technical Specifications</h3>

<ul>

<li><strong>Work in an 11 by 17 format</strong>.</li>

<li>Keep in mind where the <strong>title and trade dress</strong> will go.</li>

<li><strong>Separate your pencils from your inks and colors</strong> if you're working digitally.</li>

<li>If you're working traditionally, <strong>take frequent progress pictures</strong>.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Flexibility for Revisions</h3>

<p>If an editor has notes for your cover, you want to <strong>easily make those requested changes</strong>.</p>

<h2>Process Guidelines</h2>

<h3>Create Thumbnails</h3>

<ul>

<li><strong>Make at least three thumbnails</strong> before jumping into the final.</li>

<li>Experiment with <strong>more realistic compositions</strong> and <strong>iconic graphic compositions</strong>.</li>

<li>Take your favorite thumbnail to a point where you've solved most of the composition and drawing issues before going into your final piece.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Remember Eric's Do's and Don'ts</h3>

<ul>

<li><strong>Value Separation</strong>: Make sure to create value separation so you have a clear foreground, middle ground, and background.</li>

<li><strong>Sense of Movement</strong>: Keep a sense of movement in your thumbnails.</li>

<li><strong>Avoid Edges</strong>: Try not to place important elements on the edges of the page.</li>

<li><strong>Add Variety</strong>: Add variety to your composition by juxtaposing scale and spacing between the elements.</li>

<li><strong>Avoid Tangents</strong>: Do everything you can to avoid tangents.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Your Chance to Shine</h2>

<p>Alright, this is your chance. <strong>Go make something that you'd want to see in your local comic shop</strong>. You have until <strong>[this date]</strong> to submit your art for possible inclusion in the critique video.</p>
