<p>In this critique session, we focus on <strong>gestural architecture drawings</strong>, specifically distorted houses and mansions. The key challenge lies in <strong>balancing creative distortion with maintaining a convincing 3D form</strong>. This balance is crucial for creating visually interesting and structurally sound architectural designs.</p>

<h2>Maintaining 3D Form in Distorted Drawings</h2>

<p>When creating distorted architectural drawings, it's essential to <strong>maintain clear plane changes and corners</strong>. This helps preserve the three-dimensionality of the structure, even when pushing the boundaries of realistic representation. Avoid creating flat shapes that lack depth. Instead, use <strong>overlaps to indicate depth</strong> and maintain the illusion of a 3D form.</p>

<h3>Example: Saschu's Work</h3>

<p>Saschu's drawing demonstrated an intentionally bloated effect. However, it lost three-dimensionality due to the absence of clear corners and plane changes. This resulted in the drawing appearing as flat shapes rather than a 3D form. To improve this, we demonstrated how to bloat a house while maintaining its 3D form:</p>

<ul>

<li>Push the roof corner in the opposite direction to maintain foreshortening</li>

<li>Consider the entire form, not just individual lines</li>

<li>Use overlaps to create depth</li>

</ul>

<h2>Balancing Gesture and Structure</h2>

<p>In gestural architecture, aim for a balance of <strong>80% perspective and 20% gesture</strong> for buildings. This ratio helps maintain structural integrity while allowing for creative expression. It's important to follow perspective rules while adding organic tilts and angles.</p>

<h3>Example: Lasuli's Submission</h3>

<p>Lasuli's work was praised for achieving a good balance between gesture and structure:</p>

<ul>

<li>Followed perspective rules while adding organic tilts and angles</li>

<li>Maintained clear plane changes and tapering</li>

<li>Incorporated fun details that adhered to the perspective</li>

</ul>

<h2>Deforming Forms vs. Individual Lines</h2>

<p>When distorting architectural forms, focus on <strong>deforming entire forms rather than individual lines</strong>. This approach helps maintain the overall structure and believability of the design.</p>

<h3>Example: Matias' Work</h3>

<p>In Matias' submission, the middle house lost its form in an attempt to implode it. The right house maintained perspective but had lines deformed independently. We advised:</p>

<ul>

<li>Deform forms, not just individual lines</li>

<li>Maintain the overall structure of the building</li>

</ul>

<h2>Subtle Deformations for Personality</h2>

<p>Subtle deformations can be highly effective in giving personality to architectural designs while maintaining believability.</p>

<h3>Example: Johannes' Submission</h3>

<p>Johannes' work was highly praised for its subtle yet effective deformations:</p>

<ul>

<li>Fun details in roof tiles and wooden boards</li>

<li>Subtle deformations gave personality while maintaining believability</li>

<li>Achieved a storybook feel</li>

</ul>

<h2>Handling Extreme Distortions</h2>

<p>Even when pushing distortions to the extreme, it's possible to maintain depth and 3D structure.</p>

<h3>Example: Jayoshi's Work</h3>

<p>Jayoshi's castle drawing pushed distortion to the extreme but still worked effectively:</p>

<ul>

<li>Maintained depth and 3D structure despite heavy distortion</li>

<li>Spent 7-8 hours on each drawing, showing dedication to the craft</li>

</ul>

<h2>Common Issues and Solutions</h2>

<p>Several common issues emerged during the critique:</p>

<ul>

<li>Random distortions losing clarity</li>

<li>Inconsistencies in the thickness of elements</li>

<li>Losing perspective in melted appearances</li>

</ul>

<h3>Example: Diana's Submission</h3>

<p>Diana's work illustrated some of these issues:</p>

<ul>

<li>Houses looked melted, losing too much perspective</li>

<li>Unclear forms in some areas</li>

<li>Tree house was interesting but difficult to show perspective due to melted appearance</li>

</ul>

<p>To improve, we suggested:</p>

<ul>

<li>Maintain clear plane changes</li>

<li>Use overlaps and thickness variations to indicate depth</li>

</ul>

<h2>General Advice for Improvement</h2>

<p>To improve your gestural architecture drawings:</p>

<ul>

<li>Focus on deforming entire forms, not just individual lines</li>

<li>Maintain clear plane changes and corners for a 3D effect</li>

<li>Balance between gesture and structure (80% perspective, 20% gesture for buildings)</li>

<li>Use subtle deformations to create personality</li>

<li>Consider the entire form when making distortions</li>

</ul>

<p>Gestural architecture is a challenging but rewarding technique that allows for creative expression while maintaining structural integrity. Continue practicing and experimenting with these concepts. In our next lesson, we'll explore gestural torsos, applying similar principles to figure drawing.</p>

<p>Remember, the key to improvement is consistent practice and thoughtful application of these principles. Keep pushing your boundaries while maintaining a strong foundation in perspective and form.</p>
