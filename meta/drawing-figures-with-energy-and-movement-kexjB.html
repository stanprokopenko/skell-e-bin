<p>In this section, we're moving towards actually making our drawings. <strong>Figures always feel the most convincing when they exhibit a type of movement</strong>. I want to choose a technique or approach that gathers all the concerns we've had so far, especially from our breakdown of the eight parts, and also carries a sense of motion.</p>

<h2>Embracing Asymmetry</h2>

<p>I'm sure you can imagine that what I'm moving towards is the principle of <strong>asymmetry</strong>. For any number of reasons, asymmetry is a fantastic choice. Throughout art history, there's been a prevalent interest in rhythm, curve, and the movement of line.</p>

<p>When I draw the body, I notice how it seems to sync with what's already happening due to the influence of the spine. This principle is also prevalent on the contouring of the arm. By appreciating abstraction, I can use asymmetry to create movement and rhythm in my drawings.</p>

<h2>Creating Movement with Offset Curves</h2>

<p>Anytime I have a <strong>curve with its apex offset to a curve below that has its apex slightly shifted</strong>, I create a natural interest in the viewer's attention. This is very different from what I often see in gesture drawings, where people tend to create parallel forms.</p>

<p>When we parallel forms, it creates closure. By isolating or bracketing those parentheses, we're telling the brain that there's a complete shape that doesn't carry over any of the naturalistic principles we've looked at. Instead, I consciously do the opposite.</p>

<h2>Drawing Ideas, Not Outlines</h2>

<p>When asked if I'm drawing the outside of the leg or the back of the leg, my answer is <strong>it's never any of it</strong>. It's an idea about its position, but primarily, the idea is asymmetry for the creation of rhythm.</p>

<h2>Practicing Asymmetrical Curves</h2>

<p>If you find this difficult at first, it's not a bad idea to do warm-up exercises in your sketchbook focusing on <strong>asymmetry</strong>. <strong>Have fun creating engaging rhythms</strong> on a page, focusing on the most important quality: can you engage the eye with long, wandering pathways?</p>

<p>Maybe these rhythms go on top of each other, but really you're trying to get in the habit of creating this link. I want there to be a certain degree of hand-holding or chaining between these.</p>

<h2>Understanding Rhythm</h2>

<p>Every line represents a part. The spacing in between represents the joint, the transition between parts. That's the most developed connection I'm making. It's not the front, it's not the back, it's not the contour. <strong>Every line equals the simplified, abstracted idea of the part</strong>, and I focus on creating movement through that offset relationship of apexes.</p>

<h2>Gesture Drawing Techniques</h2>

<h3>Using Simple Lines</h3>

<p>As I go through my drawings, I'm only using a <strong>straight line, a C-curve, and an S-curve</strong>. They can be of any variation. A C-curve could look like that, you don't have to make them look like the alphabet.</p>

<p>I try to introduce a bit of <strong>economy with line use</strong>. For example, straights aren't great for rhythm, so I mostly keep these for areas of weight or sometimes bone. But they're very rare, the majority of what I'll be doing is using the C and the S.</p>

<h3>Emphasizing Asymmetry</h3>

<p>You've already heard me discuss the importance and use of <strong>asymmetry</strong>. That's going to be my primary way of making drawings. I'll also introduce some <strong>wrapping lines</strong>, you could call these wrapping lines, contouring, surfacing lines, or cross contours. It's all notational, this is all just for me or you, nobody will see this, so use what you need.</p>

<h3>Proportion Comes Last</h3>

<p>The last thing on this list is <strong>proportion</strong>. I usually put it last because I don't want you to be hyper-focused on getting the size right when you should be more focused on the story.</p>

<h2>Steps for Drawing the Figure</h2>

<h3>Starting with the Head</h3>

<p>I like to start with the <strong>head</strong>. You don't have to start with the head, but for me, the head is a great opportunity to begin with a natural focal point. If I'm describing rhythms, curves, and movements, the head is a natural way to start the viewer's journey.</p>

<h3>Drawing the Spine with Four Lines</h3>

<p>From there, I move through the <strong>spine</strong>. I do this with <strong>four lines</strong>:</p>

<ol>

<li><strong>Neck (cervical curve)</strong></li>

<li><strong>Thoracic spine</strong></li>

<li><strong>Stretching of the front of the body</strong></li>

<li><strong>Lumbar spine</strong></li>

</ol>

<p>These lines capture the movement and flow of the spine through the body.</p>

<h3>Adding the Pelvis and Legs</h3>

<p>Next, I work into the <strong>weight-bearing side of the pelvis</strong>, which usually gets one line. From the weight-bearing side of the pelvis, if possible, I move into the <strong>weight-bearing leg</strong>. Each limb for me is about <strong>two to three lines</strong>.</p>

<p>Then I work on the supporting leg so that I'm consciously making a different emphasis on where weight is in the body.</p>

<h3>Drawing the Arms</h3>

<p>I then move into the <strong>arms</strong>, again, using two to three lines for each limb. The important thing is that <strong>every line leads you to every other line</strong>.</p>

<h3>Total Lines Used</h3>

<p>In total, if you feel lost or confused with your gesture, I'm using <strong>16 to 17 lines</strong> to get the gesture down. If you feel like it's not making sense, bring your attention back to that and see if that helps you match up to what I'm doing.</p>

<h2>Flexibility in Your Approach</h2>

<p>You can reorganize this. I've studied with tons of people who think doing the head first is the worst possible thing you could do because the gesture is in the body and the head is an afterthought. Everyone will say something different, and every gesture process is unique to the person using it.</p>

<p>I think you should have a couple of different approaches, and each should be a different tool to allow you to get what you want out of an image. <strong>Take what I've shown you and reorganize it however you like</strong>.</p>

<h2>Drawing the Feet</h2>

<h3>Simplifying the Foot</h3>

<p>The basic idea of the <strong>foot</strong> is a <strong>triangle</strong>. It's a good shape because we want to have some stability and contact with the ground. I always try to keep this with some type of movement or dynamism to it.</p>

<h3>Different Views of the Foot</h3>

<ul>

<li><strong>Front View</strong>: A simple triangle shape.</li>

<li><strong>Three-Quarter View</strong>: Move the front part over to see more of the side.</li>

<li><strong>Profile View</strong>: Similar shape without the front.</li>

<li><strong>Back View</strong>: Use the same principle but make the heel straight across.</li>

</ul>

<h3>The Bendy Sock</h3>

<p>In poses where the foot is up and arched, I use the "bendy sock" concept, pushing and stretching the shape to convey the movement.</p>

<h2>Using Wrapping Lines</h2>

<h3>Conveying 3D Tilt</h3>

<p>I introduce <strong>wrapping lines</strong> to indicate the basic 3D tilt of each part. I'm using the wrapping line like a rubber band subtracted off a cylinder. For example:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Head</strong>: If it's leaned back, I show that subtle tilt.</li>

<li><strong>Neck and Rib Cage</strong>: I know the neck comes forward, and the rib cage comes out.</li>

<li><strong>Pelvis</strong>: I use wrapping lines to show its tilt.</li>

</ul>

<p>This notation helps me understand the perspective and foreshortening, even if I can't fully solve it without shapes.</p>

<h2>Maintaining Rhythm and Movement</h2>

<h3>Leading the Eye</h3>

<p>I've composed the read for the viewer to move with <strong>composition</strong>, asymmetry, starting at the head and engaging with the rhythm that pulls you down piece by piece into the ground. I've done everything I can to make it so that the viewer looks and engages with the drawing from <strong>head to foot</strong>.</p>

<h3>Avoiding Verticals</h3>

<p>I never use vertical lines in my drawing. The only things I'm doing that are key here to keep something that feels active and full of motion are:</p>

<ol>

<li><strong>The rhythm or the curve</strong></li>

<li><strong>Every curve exists on a diagonal</strong></li>

</ol>

<h2>Developing Your Personal Style</h2>

<h3>Experimenting with Poses</h3>

<p>If you'd like to try to change or move your poses around, you can start to play with where the <strong>center of gravity</strong> is on a figure. You can check this by looking at the <strong>pit of the neck</strong> and plumb a line down. If this center of gravity line is close to the medial ankle (the medial malleolus), that's a pretty balanced pose.</p>

<p>Sometimes a fun exercise is to try to avoid that. Use the understanding of the center of gravity to create a pose that's different. <strong>What would a non-balanced pose look like?</strong></p>

<h3>Expressing Emotion</h3>

<p>Another thing I like to do is write down what I think the emotion of the pose is, maybe it's sad or anxious. Whatever comes to mind first. Then I look at if my drawing communicates that in a way that is clear.</p>

<h3>Practicing and Refining</h3>

<p>It's common in drawing classes to do these really quickly, usually in a minute or two. There's always this emphasis on getting it done quickly, but <strong>speed comes with practice</strong>. If it takes you five minutes to get here, and you feel good about it, that's awesome. There's no need to rush.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p>These are my <strong>six steps</strong> that bring the prior lessons into one focused exercise, and keep us under that umbrella of <strong>16 or 17 lines</strong>. Hopefully, you have a bit of an idea of the cadence of my lines, short, medium, long, so there's asymmetry even in their lengths.</p>

<p>Regardless of the view, I don't need to change my approach. The same organization of lines works from just about all angles. The point is, there's no right or wrong. <strong>Your style and approach to gesture should allow you to explore and communicate</strong>. This is my way of capturing movement and rhythm in figure drawing, and I encourage you to develop and refine your own technique.</p>
