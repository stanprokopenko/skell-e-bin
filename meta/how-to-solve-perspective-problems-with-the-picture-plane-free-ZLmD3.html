<h2>What's in Premium?</h2>

<p>In the premium lesson, you'll learn how the picture plane serves as a window into perspective drawing. We examine how closer objects appear larger and distant ones smaller, highlighting the fundamentals of perspective. The lesson covers <strong>one-point perspective</strong>, where only one set of lines recedes to a vanishing point, and <strong>two-point perspective</strong>, where two sets of lines lead to their respective vanishing points. You'll discover precise methods to find these vanishing points without guesswork. We introduce the <strong>plan and projection method</strong> to draw accurate three-dimensional views from orthographic projections, enabling you to achieve accuracy and precision in your perspective drawings.</p>
