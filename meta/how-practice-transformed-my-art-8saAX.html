<h2>Starting Out at Watts Atelier</h2>

<p>When I first walked into Watts Atelier, I was a novice. They handed me a charcoal pencil sharpened in a way I'd never seen, like a bullet with an inch of exposed charcoal. Holding it overhand felt strange. My early exercises were simple, drawing ovals, basic primitives, and trying out value scales. My attempts at shading were poor, and I struggled to separate shadows from lights.</p>

<h2>Learning the Basics</h2>

<p>We practiced drawing <strong>Asaro heads</strong>, focusing on the planes of the head. I traced over printouts, identifying rhythms and movements across muscles. These exercises helped me see relationships between shapes and understand how to apply a template to different faces. I remember being proud of a two-hour drawing that, looking back now, was full of mistakes. But at the time, it felt like a significant win.</p>

<h2>Early Figure Drawings</h2>

<p>My first figure drawings were challenging. I focused on outlines, using symbolic shapes instead of analyzing actual forms. My gestures were stiff, and I didn't understand how to capture movement. Quick sketches overwhelmed me, I couldn't make decisions fast enough in the time allotted. My shadow shapes were non-committal, and I was afraid to group entire areas into shadow.</p>

<h2>Embracing Practice and Growth</h2>

<p>I filled pages with warm-ups: circles, tones, and quick sketches. Doing 30 of these in a day gave me the mileage I needed. Improvement was subtle, almost imperceptible when looking at each drawing individually. But over time, the accumulation of practice began to show. I learned that <strong>committing to shapes</strong> was essential. By simplifying and designing shadow and light shapes, I could control composition and enhance the three-dimensional feeling in my drawings.</p>

<h2>Learning from Instructors</h2>

<p>Instructors would often draw over my work, showing me how to simplify and focus on the gesture rather than the details. They emphasized the importance of identifying cylinders and basic forms before adding complexity. Seeing their confident lines and anatomical knowledge inspired me to improve. I realized that the beauty of the line itself could be art.</p>

<h2>Understanding Talent vs. Skill</h2>

<p>I've come to realize that becoming a good artist isn't about being born with talent. It's about <strong>practice, growth, and dedication</strong>. Some people may have natural advantages, but art requires a diverse set of skills. Whether it's creativity, discipline, or an understanding of technology, everyone has an <strong>unfair advantage</strong>. The key is to find it and leverage it.</p>

<h2>Progress Over Time</h2>

<p>As I continued to practice, I noticed improvements in my work. My line work became more confident, and my understanding of anatomy deepened. I started to focus on gestures, the flow of the figure, and the structure beneath the surface. I learned to be deliberate with my decisions, whether it was in line quality or shape design. Even though progress was slow and filled with moments where my drawings seemed worse, I knew that <strong>pushing beyond comfort zones</strong> was essential for growth.</p>

<h2>Reflecting on the Journey</h2>

<p>Looking back at my old sketchbooks, I can see how far I've come. The progress may have seemed slow, but each drawing was a step forward. I want to share this journey to show that improvement is possible with dedication and hard work. Don't be discouraged by comparisons to others. Instead, focus on becoming the <strong>best version of yourself</strong>. Find what you're good at, embrace your unique strengths, and keep practicing.</p>
