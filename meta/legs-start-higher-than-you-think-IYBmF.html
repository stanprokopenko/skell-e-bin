<p>In this lesson, I focus on bringing the legs and torso together. I use <strong>curves</strong> when forms flow in roughly the same direction, and <strong>corners</strong> when they shift in distinct directions. My goal is to create a clear connection through the <strong>pelvis</strong>, which I often imagine as a simple bulging box or “beanbag.”</p>

<h2>Curves and Corners</h2>

<p>I like to think of the torso and hips flowing together smoothly if they lean in the same direction. A <strong>corner</strong> is best when there’s a sudden change or when a form folds or overlaps. If I imagine a simple miniskirt around the pelvis, that skirt edge can help me see the underlying curves or corners where the torso shifts into each leg.</p>

<h2>The Pelvis as a Bulging Box</h2>

<p>I sometimes envision the pelvis as a <strong>box</strong> that bulges out on the sides. It can compress or expand like a beanbag depending on how the torso and legs push or pull against it. When the torso leans down and the leg stretches up, the extra “material” of the pelvis squishes outward. That swelling can change from one side to the other, giving the hips <strong>asymmetry</strong> that feels natural.</p>

<h2>The Beanbag Idea</h2>

<p>The <strong>beanbag</strong> analogy helps me see how forms meet. The top half (torso) presses down, and the bottom half (legs) pushes up. Where these forces meet, the pelvis squishes and shifts. This creates subtle curves along the hips, especially noticeable when one leg is bearing weight and the other is not.</p>

<h2>Positioning the Legs</h2>

<p>To avoid a “Stonehenge” look, I connect the legs high into the pelvis. The hips don’t just sit on top of the legs, the upper thigh often flares out or tapers like a <strong>drumstick</strong> beneath the hip joint. By pushing the leg insertion up near the midpoint, or even higher in some poses, I keep the figure's flow more natural and integrated.</p>

<p>• I often start with a simple hip shape (the bulging box).<br />

• I shape each leg insertion as a curve or corner, making sure it feels snug and logical within the pelvis.<br />

• I use <strong>asymmetry</strong> to keep the pose lively. One side can sit higher, and the other can compress lower.  </p>

<p>By thinking of the pelvis, legs, and torso this way, I can draw a more fluid and believable figure where the forms truly connect.</p>
