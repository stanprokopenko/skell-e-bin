<p>In this tutorial, you'll learn how to create a head painting using a <strong>grid method</strong>. This approach is broken down into <strong>strict stages</strong> to help you achieve accurate results, especially if you're a beginner. By following these stages, you'll likely create something wonderful, perhaps something you've never been able to do before because you've tried to do too much all at once. As part of this lesson, you'll take photos after each stage to track your progress. This will help you paint along with the tutorial and see your improvement.</p>

<h2>Tools and Materials</h2>

<p>To get started, you'll need a few essential tools:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Vine Charcoal</strong>: Opt for the thinnest sticks you can find. Thin charcoal is easier to work with and requires less sanding.</li>

<li><strong>Sandpaper Pad</strong>: Available at any art store, this will help you sharpen your charcoal.</li>

<li><strong>Kneaded Eraser</strong>: You only need a small amount to make corrections.</li>

</ul>

<p>These simple tools are all you need to begin transferring your grid drawing onto the canvas.</p>

<h2>The Grid Method</h2>

<p>The grid method involves overlaying a grid on both your reference photo and your canvas. This allows you to focus on one square at a time, making it easier to transfer what you see onto your canvas. The grid helps you <strong>focus on shapes</strong> instead of preconceived notions of what you're drawing. This method is not foreign, it's a way to train your mind to see and record accurately.</p>

<h2>Drawing Process</h2>

<p>Here's a step-by-step guide to using the grid for your drawing:</p>

<ol>

<li><strong>Select a Square</strong>: Choose any square to start with. The grid allows you to begin anywhere, unlike freehand drawing where you might start with a specific feature like an eye.</li>

<li><strong>Focus on Shapes</strong>: Look at the positive and negative shapes within each square. Match these shapes on your canvas.</li>

<li><strong>Avoid Overthinking</strong>: Resist the urge to think of the subject as a head or any specific feature. Instead, focus on the shapes and their placement.</li>

<li><strong>Connect the Dots</strong>: As you move from square to square, connect the shapes to form the overall image.</li>

</ol>

<p>This process helps you learn to draw without relying on preconceived knowledge, allowing you to place features accurately.</p>

<h2>Mindset and Approach</h2>

<p>While using the grid, it's crucial to <strong>turn off preconceived knowledge</strong>. Trust the grid and avoid making ego-driven decisions. This method requires you to stop thinking about the subject as a head and instead focus on the shapes. This approach can be an ego breaker, but it reveals the truth of what's in front of you.</p>

<h2>Transition to Painting</h2>

<p>Once your drawing is accurately placed using the grid, you're ready to transition to painting. The grid method ensures that your drawing is as accurate as possible, providing a solid foundation for painting. By following this method, you'll likely find that your painting looks better and comes together more quickly.</p>

<p>The grid method is a powerful tool for achieving accuracy in your drawings. By focusing on shapes and following strict stages, you can improve your drawing skills and create more accurate paintings. Continue practicing with the grid to enhance your accuracy and confidence in your art.</p>
