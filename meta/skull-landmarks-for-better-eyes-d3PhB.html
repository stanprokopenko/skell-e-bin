<p>In this chapter, we'll focus on the basic anatomy and structure of the human eyes. First, we'll explore the underlying structure and form of the skull, especially around the eyes. Then, we'll do an exercise that I strongly recommend, especially if you're a beginner trying to understand how to render and grasp the basic forms of the eyes. I suggest doing studies of old classical statues and sculptures. Finally, we'll work through a series of gestures from images I've collected, featuring a variety of expressions, ethnic types, and age categories. At the end, I'll demonstrate my process for rendering the eyes, going from simple to complex, culminating in a full-color render.</p>

<p>So that's a quick summary of this chapter. Let's dive right in.</p>

<h2>The Underlying Structure of the Skull</h2>

<h3>Front View of the Skull</h3>

<p>To better understand the overall shape of the eye sockets, we'll start with the front view of the skull. I'll use the <strong>Loomis method</strong> to block in the overall gesture of the skull before focusing on the eyes.</p>

<p><strong>Using the Loomis Method:</strong></p>

<ol>

<li><strong>Draw a sphere</strong> to represent the volume of the cranium.</li>

<li><strong>Draw a line</strong> cutting that sphere in half to find the <strong>brow line</strong>.</li>

<li><strong>Pull out the mass of the jaw</strong> from there.</li>

<li><strong>Divide the skull into thirds:</strong><ul>

<li>From the top of the skull to the brow line is <strong>one third</strong>.</li>

<li>From the brow line to the base of the sphere (which represents the base of the nose) is <strong>one third</strong>.</li>

<li>From the base of the nose to the base of the chin is <strong>one third</strong>.</li>

</ul>

</li>

</ol>

<p>This helps with getting your proportions in the ballpark when drawing faces.</p>

<p>Now that we have this underlying sketch, we can start breaking up the forms and adding more detail.</p>

<p><strong>The Temporal Line:</strong></p>

<ul>

<li>Establishing the <strong>temporal line</strong>, which is the edge on the lateral side of the skull.</li>

<li>It flows into the eye socket, connecting the structure of the side of the skull with the front.</li>

<li>This is a <strong>key landmark</strong> to remember.</li>

</ul>

<p><strong>The Glabella (Keystone Shape):</strong></p>

<ul>

<li>Next, establish the <strong>glabella</strong>, or the <strong>keystone shape</strong> of the skull.</li>

<li>It's an important landmark because it helps establish the rest of the skull and face when drawing a fleshed-out face.</li>

<li>It helps you get the distance between the eye sockets, and you can build the eyes out from the glabella, ensuring they're symmetrical.</li>

<li>You can also build out the nose from this keystone shape.</li>

</ul>

<p><strong>Simplifying the Eye Sockets:</strong></p>

<ul>

<li>I like to simplify the eye sockets as <strong>box shapes</strong> that droop down away from the skull, kind of like Wall-E's eyes.</li>

<li>Constructing the eye sockets from these box shapes instead of spheres helps understand their form.</li>

</ul>

<p><strong>Additional Structures:</strong></p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Nasal Bone:</strong> Comes out of the glabella and starts the nasal cavity.</li>

<li><strong>Maxilla:</strong> Helps form the medial sides of the eye socket and flows down into the superior maxillary and the zygomatic bone (cheekbone).</li>

<li>The <strong>superciliary eminence</strong> is the brow ridge above the eye socket.<ul>

<li>Individuals with a strong brow or superciliary eminence have that Neanderthal look.</li>

<li>An example is Harrison Ford, who has a pronounced brow.</li>

</ul>

</li>

</ul>

<p><strong>Understanding the Eye Socket:</strong></p>

<ul>

<li>The eye sockets are more <strong>boxy in shape</strong> and <strong>tilt down towards the outside</strong> of the skull.</li>

<li>Emphasizing the importance of the <strong>glabella</strong> helps in accurate placement.</li>

<li>The <strong>eyeball is set back</strong> in the skull, in a box-shaped eye socket rather than a round hole.<ul>

<li>This allows room for the eyeball to move and space for all the muscles and ligaments attached to the eye, including the trochlea.</li>

</ul>

</li>

</ul>

<h3>Profile View of the Skull</h3>

<p>Now let's move on to the profile view of the skull. We'll go through this a bit quicker, focusing on a few key pointers.</p>

<p><strong>Constructing the Profile:</strong></p>

<ul>

<li>Start with the <strong>Loomis method</strong> again.<ul>

<li>Begin with a simple sphere to block out the mass of the cranium.</li>

<li>Note that the profile of the cranium is more <strong>oblong</strong>, stretched out a bit, so it's not a perfect sphere.</li>

<li>Add additional mass to represent the front of the skull or face.</li>

</ul>

</li>

<li>Draw a smaller circle in the middle to indicate where the <strong>temporal line</strong> will be.</li>

<li>Cut the sphere in half vertically and horizontally to find the <strong>brow line</strong>.</li>

<li>The base of the sphere represents the base of the cranium, leading to the base of the nose.</li>

<li>The <strong>jaw</strong> comes out from the base of where the ear would be.</li>

<li>The <strong>spine</strong> comes out of the base of the cranium, more forward-leaning and oriented, so avoid making it come straight out to prevent stiffness.</li>

</ul>

<p><strong>Key Observations:</strong></p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Eye Socket Shape:</strong><ul>

<li>The upper portion of the eye socket is more of a straight line that's angled.</li>

<li>The side plane from a profile perspective is a downward swooping curve.</li>

<li>This creates a nice design to the profile of the eye socket.</li>

</ul>

</li>

<li><strong>Glabella and Nasal Bone:</strong><ul>

<li>The crease between the glabella and nasal bone connects to the side line of the eye socket.</li>

</ul>

</li>

<li><strong>Cheekbone Connection:</strong><ul>

<li>Draw a line connecting the glabella to the front plane of the cheekbone.</li>

<li>Notice how it recedes back and connects to the zygomatic arch (cheekbone).</li>

</ul>

</li>

<li><strong>Overlapping Forms:</strong><ul>

<li>Look for opportunities for overlapping lines, as they help create a sense of depth.</li>

</ul>

</li>

</ul>

<p><strong>Importance for Drawing the Eye:</strong></p>

<ul>

<li>The profile view helps you understand the <strong>bony landmarks</strong> that show up subcutaneously in a living model.<ul>

<li>The brow ridge and superciliary eminence are features that are visible even with flesh.</li>

</ul>

</li>

<li>The <strong>eye is set further back</strong> in the skull, the eyeball rests about half an inch behind the crease where the glabella and nasal bone converge.</li>

<li>From the profile, you'll see the <strong>protrusion of the cornea</strong> that sits on top of the iris and pupil.</li>

<li>Understanding the skull helps you know how far back the eyelids wrap around the eyeball and how much of the <strong>sclera</strong> (white of the eye) is exposed.</li>

</ul>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p>Studying the underlying bone structure is crucial when drawing the eyes, especially in portraits. There are so many bony landmarks that influence the surface forms. Remember, the eye sockets are boxy in shape and tilt down towards the outside of the skull. The <strong>glabella</strong> is a key landmark for establishing symmetry and accurate placement of the eyes and nose.</p>

<p>I think that's enough on the skull to help us understand the surrounding bony landmarks around the eye. In the next exercise, we'll move on to studies of classical sculptures.</p>
