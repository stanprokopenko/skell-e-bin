<p>In this tutorial, I'll walk you through my head construction method and how to adapt it for different character types, focusing on the differences between male and female features. We'll look at some exaggerated examples to illustrate key points you can push, pull, or exaggerate to create different styles or looks for your characters.</p>

<h2>Female Head Construction: The Audrey Hepburn Approach</h2>

<p>When drawing female characters, especially younger ones, remember that <strong>less is often better</strong>. We want to create a softer, more subtle appearance with less prominent bone structure.</p>

<h3>Overall Approach</h3>

<ul>

<li>Use <strong>softer curves</strong> instead of harsh angles</li>

<li><strong>Understate features</strong> for subtlety</li>

<li><strong>Minimize bony protrusions</strong></li>

</ul>

<h3>Key Areas to Consider</h3>

<ol>

<li><strong>Forehead</strong>: Make it slightly straighter and more vertical than the typical sphere.</li>

<li><strong>Jaw</strong>: Create a softer sweep with less angle difference between the mandible and the back of the jaw.</li>

<li><strong>Cheekbones</strong>: Keep them high but subtle, with a smooth surface due to malar fat covering.</li>

<li><strong>Brow</strong>: Make it less commanding and aggressive. Suggest the turn of the forehead or temple lightly.</li>

<li><strong>Eyes</strong>: Keep the eye structure subtle, using curved lines instead of aggressive architectural planes.</li>

<li><strong>Nose</strong>: Use slight curves and less angle. Think "less straights, more curves" for a passive quality.</li>

<li><strong>Mouth</strong>: Heighten the curve of the upper lip's "M" shape for a classic Hollywood look.</li>

<li><strong>Chin</strong>: Make it softer and more passive, with a gentler movement back.</li>

</ol>

<h3>Drawing Process</h3>

<ol>

<li>Start with basic shapes, but don't feel bound by them. You can modify the initial sphere for the cranium to better fit your character.</li>

<li>Lay in the side plane and temple very lightly. Not every part of the construction needs to be dark and obvious.</li>

<li>When placing features, keep them understated. For example, the cheek line can be faint and pushed up high.</li>

<li>As you work, continually refine and adjust. It's okay to shift things around after the initial construction.</li>

<li>For the mouth, understate the philtrum drop and emphasize the curve of the upper lip.</li>

<li>Add hair last, thinking of it as a "plastic hat" that wraps around the head shape.</li>

</ol>

<p>Remember, it's okay to make changes and corrections as you go. The final result might look different from where you started, and that's part of the process.</p>

<h2>Male Head Construction: The Exaggerated Approach</h2>

<p>For our male example, we'll push the masculine features to create a strong contrast with the female approach.</p>

<h3>Overall Approach</h3>

<ul>

<li>Use <strong>more pronounced features</strong> and bone structure</li>

<li>Employ <strong>straight lines and angles</strong> instead of curves</li>

<li><strong>Emphasize the underlying skull structure</strong></li>

</ul>

<h3>Key Areas to Consider</h3>

<ol>

<li><strong>Jaw</strong>: Make it broader with a more vertical angle.</li>

<li><strong>Chin</strong>: Create a strong projection with an exaggerated forward plane or "stair step".</li>

<li><strong>Cheekbones</strong>: Place them lower and make them more angular.</li>

<li><strong>Forehead</strong>: Use a more reclined, diagonal angle.</li>

<li><strong>Brow ridge</strong>: Exaggerate its development and push its shape.</li>

<li><strong>Nose</strong>: Make the nasal structure wider, possibly due to a larger nasal aperture.</li>

<li><strong>Eyes</strong>: They might appear smaller due to the development of bone around them.</li>

</ol>

<h3>Drawing Process</h3>

<ol>

<li>Start with the basic skull construction, but immediately begin emphasizing the masculine features.</li>

<li>Use straight lines to set up the face, contrasting with the curves used in the female approach.</li>

<li>Exaggerate the brow ridge, really pushing its shape and the surface changes as it rolls back.</li>

<li>Make the nose structure broader, but maintain the same drop points.</li>

<li>Lower the cheekbone and widen the zygomatic arch (the area between the cheekbone and ear).</li>

<li>Emphasize the chin's forward projection and the strong angle of the jaw.</li>

</ol>

<h2>Comparing Female and Male Approaches</h2>

<p>The key difference lies in how we use the head construction to push and morph the character in different directions. For females, we're often <strong>downplaying or de-emphasizing the underlying structure</strong> to create a softer, more understated look. For males, we're <strong>playing up and even accelerating the ideas of construction and skull</strong>.</p>

<p>Remember, individual features are important, but they're not as crucial as the overall head construction in defining character. The big organization of the head is what really communicates the character type.</p>

<p>Lastly, keep in mind that these are generalized approaches. Factors like age and ethnicity will also play a role in how you construct and modify your characters' heads. The goal is to understand how to use the head construction method as a flexible tool to create diverse and interesting characters.</p>
