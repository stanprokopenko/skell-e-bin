<h2>What's in Premium?</h2>

<p>In this lesson, we dive into mastering light and shadow in your artwork. We start by determining the light source to ensure your focal point is well-lit and draws attention. You'll learn how to add shadows using multiply layers and choose shadow colors that convey the mood and setting. We cover shading techniques that add texture and depth, and discuss the difference between form shadows and cast shadows to enhance realism. We also explore adjusting shadows for clarity, using clipping masks to add bounce light, and adding texture and detail to guide the viewer's eye. By the end, you'll understand how to use shading to create depth and evoke emotion in your art.</p>
