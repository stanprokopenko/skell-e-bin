<p>Let's practice everything you've learned about <strong>value composition</strong> in the past few lessons. In this project, you're going to take reference images and explore several variations of value compositions.</p>

<h2>Creating Thumbnail Sketches</h2>

<p>I provided you with two photos in the downloads. <strong>Do thumbnail sketches</strong> the size of your thumbnail or palm, or anything in between, simplifying again to just <strong>three values</strong>. This is similar to the previous master studies project, but now <strong>you are the composer</strong>. You'll use your creativity to find the versions of the value compositions that you like best.</p>

<h3>Start Small and Simple</h3>

<p>Start with small and simple thumbnails to capture the main idea. Play with that for a little. If you attempt small and simple but end up with large and detailed, <strong>try again</strong>. Don't just say, "Oops, I went a little overboard on this one." Try again and simplify it. Sometimes it's easier to simplify on the second attempt after you've gotten that urge out to include all those details.</p>

<h2>The Importance of Iteration</h2>

<p>I know the temptation to try to make a really nice finished piece, but the benefit of thumbnails is you can try <strong>many ideas quickly</strong> and not go down a long path you end up not liking. That idea could have been better if you had just spent a little time thinking through the big idea first.</p>

<p>After you finish that first thumbnail, do more quick iterations to <strong>explore value ideas</strong>. Try to do <strong>at least five iterations of each photo</strong>. Play around by modifying groups of values.</p>

<p>Scott Flanders, a concept artist, says that the <strong>first several ideas are usually bad</strong>. You've got to get them out. Of course, there will be some cases when you hit it on that first try, but that shouldn't prevent us from exploring alternatives before deciding if that first one truly was the best. <strong>Don't fall in love with your first idea.</strong></p>

<h2>Tips for the Project</h2>

<p>Here are some random tips while you're doing this project.</p>

<h3>Experiment with Values</h3>

<p>In a portrait, you usually have a lot of freedom to do what you want with the <strong>background or clothing</strong>. So, do you want the background to be darker to emphasize white hair? Or what if the shirt and hand were both a mid value to reduce contrast? And what if we rearrange the value shapes for a totally different pattern? <strong>What if, what if, what if?</strong></p>

<h3>Keep Edges Hard</h3>

<p>Sometimes we might be tempted to add a gradation or a soft edge. <strong>Hard and soft edges have an effect</strong>, but let's keep them all hard for now. We'll focus on edges later.</p>

<h3>Simplify Environment Details</h3>

<p>Also, you don't have to add environment details or invent environments at all. Just consider various <strong>abstract shapes</strong> that those environments would simplify to.</p>

<h3>Consider Cropping</h3>

<p>Consider how you want to <strong>crop your thumbnail</strong>. You don't have to stick to the way the photo is cropped. Maybe you want to add a bunch of empty space above. What effect does that have on the portrait?</p>

<h3>Use a Dull Pencil</h3>

<p>By the way, you might want your <strong>pencil to be kind of dull</strong>. It will help you draw with larger value masses while avoiding details. It's that fine pencil tip that might lead you to those unnecessary details.</p>

<h2>Pencils vs. Markers</h2>

<p>Actually, if you've got some <strong>markers</strong>, this would be a great time to whip them out. You can choose to use <strong>pencils or markers</strong> for this project or try both. Each has its benefits.</p>

<h3>Benefits of Markers</h3>

<p><strong>Markers are faster.</strong> The thick chisel or brush tip allows us to fill in large shapes very quickly. This means that you can try more variations, more value compositions in the same amount of time.</p>

<p>Also, because markers have predefined values, it's easier to get <strong>clear value separation</strong>. They force you to think within the limited number of values. Markers force you to organize the values into those limited groups. And because the markers are thick, it's much harder to control the small detailed shapes. So, <strong>markers force you to simplify your shapes and think of the bigger idea</strong>.</p>

<h3>Benefits of Pencils</h3>

<p><strong>Pencils allow you to erase.</strong> You can adjust your shapes and values as you go. So, it might be a little bit more natural for brainstorming if you can go back and forth, light and dark, back to light, instead of just being able to darken and darken with the markers.</p>

<p>Pencils can also give you more <strong>control of your shapes</strong>. You can either use a dull flat pencil or a sharpened tip. This could be bad if you fall for the trap of adding unnecessary details, but it could also be good. You can <strong>design more attractive shapes</strong> if you have more control.</p>

<p>Also, pencils pick up the <strong>texture of the paper</strong>. Some people find this more aesthetically pleasing. And finally, pencils force you to practice that <strong>pressure sensitivity</strong> to get the value that you want. Markers make it easier, but pencils give you that additional practice.</p>

<p>Whether you choose pencils or markers, either way, you're practicing something valuable.</p>

<h2>Level Two</h2>

<p>Level two, you get <strong>two different photos</strong> in the downloads. You can start with the level one photos as a warm-up, but then move on to the level two photos.</p>

<p>After exploring many versions, if you fall in love with one of your thumbnails, whether it's the first one or not, now's the time to do a <strong>bigger thumbnail</strong> with a little bit more details and with the option of a <strong>fourth and fifth value</strong>. These could be the size of your hand or at most the size of two hands. We still want to keep them relatively small to just practice the value composition.</p>

<p>The level two photos are a bit <strong>more challenging</strong>. There's more going on and there's more that you can explore, which means more that can go wrong.</p>

<h2>Final Advice</h2>

<p>Overall, this project is pretty challenging, but don't add that additional pressure on yourself to get these beautiful drawings. Simplicity and clarity are <strong>more important than accuracy</strong>. I don't care if your proportions are correct. I don't care if you captured the likeness or the fancy details. I care if you made <strong>deliberate and confident decisions</strong> about your value groups and then clearly executed them in your small sketches.</p>

<p><strong>Remember to simplify for clarity, control your value range and key, and create a clear hierarchy to guide the viewer's eye.</strong></p>

<h2>Good Luck</h2>

<p>Okay, good luck!</p>
