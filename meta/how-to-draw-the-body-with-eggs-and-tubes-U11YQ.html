<p>I like to see bodies as combinations of <strong>eggs</strong> and <strong>tubes</strong>, sometimes with boxy corners. Eggs tend to have bulges and natural curves, while tubes can be straight or curved. These forms help me simplify anatomy. Then I add <strong>shadow shapes</strong> and contour lines to show depth and volume.</p>

<h2>Building Forms with Eggs and Tubes</h2>

<p>I start by picturing major body parts as <strong>egg-like</strong> or <strong>tube-like</strong> shapes.<br />

- The rib cage often feels like an egg.<br />

- Arms and legs can be seen as tubes.<br />

- When two forms meet, the transition can be smooth, slightly wobbled, or have a clear corner.</p>

<p>When I’m not sure how to fit everything together, I focus on the <strong>main egg</strong> or <strong>tube</strong> and keep it simple. I watch how smaller forms can bump or wobble off these bigger shapes.</p>

<h2>Drawing Shadow Shapes</h2>

<p>Shadow edges often follow the same structure as those egg and tube forms. If the form is curved, the shadow boundary will curve. I let the <strong>shadow shapes</strong> flow across the forms.<br />

- <strong>Soft edges</strong> happen where light gently transitions into shadow.<br />

- <strong>Hard edges</strong> are used for cast shadows or to show a sharp turn in the form.</p>

<p>I sometimes see a “zigzag” or “bump” in the shadow when one form meets another. Even if I’m not sure of the exact anatomy, reproducing that bump gives me a more realistic result.</p>

<h2>Corner Logic with Boxes</h2>

<p>Sometimes a form feels a bit boxy, so I look for <strong>corners</strong> in the highlights or the core shadows. If I see a strong highlight that abruptly changes direction, it can indicate a corner. Boxes work well for indicating sharp planes that catch light or fall into shadow differently.</p>

<h2>Simplifying and Iterating</h2>

<p>I keep my design flexible. When I see a bulge but don’t fully understand the anatomy, I <strong>exaggerate or smooth it</strong> based on my needs. If I notice too many wobbles that confuse me, I simplify back to <strong>one egg</strong> or <strong>one tube</strong>. Each time I work out a shape, I can iterate on it by adding or removing subtle bumps to suggest secondary forms.</p>

<h2>Practice Suggestions</h2>

<p>I recommend practicing with a small area first. Take an <strong>egg</strong> of the upper leg, attach the <strong>tube</strong> of the lower leg, and add a <strong>simple shadow</strong>. If you feel comfortable, introduce a boxy corner on a highlight or core shadow. Layer these ideas step by step. By stacking simple shapes and shadow logic, you can create a figure full of organic complexity while still keeping it easy to handle.</p>

<p>I hope these tips help you see the figure in manageable parts. Have fun experimenting and combining eggs, tubes, and boxes in your drawings. I look forward to seeing how you apply these ideas.</p>
