<h2>Exploring Angles and Poses</h2>

<p>Understanding different angles and poses is crucial for creating dynamic and realistic facial drawings. Start with the side plane for a three-quarter top view to establish the basic structure.</p>

<h2>Eye Sockets and Forehead</h2>

<p><strong>Eye Sockets:</strong>

- Cut eye sockets parallel in different views.

- Integrate eye sockets into the forehead.</p>

<p><strong>Light and Shadow:</strong>

- Understand light and shadow as plane changes.

- Emphasize understanding the surface being lit.</p>

<h2>Nose Structure</h2>

<p><strong>Starting the Nose:</strong>

- Begin with the base and find the top of the cartilage.

- Connect these points to form a trapezoid shape.</p>

<p><strong>Adjustments:</strong>

- Adjust the nose box when the head is looking down.

- Ensure plane agreement between the nose and sockets.</p>

<p><strong>Simplifying Planes:</strong>

- Simplify planes into the front of the face, side of the nose, and top of the nose.</p>

<h2>Cheek and Mouth</h2>

<p><strong>Cheek Overlap:</strong>

- Adjust cheek overlap and the center line for the mouth.</p>

<p><strong>Denture Sphere:</strong>

- Teeth sit on an orbit, affecting the face form.

- Reconsider the center line for teeth projection.</p>

<h2>Chin and Jaw</h2>

<p><strong>Chin Shape:</strong>

- Use a horizontal egg shape to fit the compartment.

- Adjust the chin shape for different artistic directions.</p>

<p><strong>Anatomy Considerations:</strong>

- Consider adding fat and muscles to the face for more realism.</p>

<h2>Surface Exploration</h2>

<p><strong>Surface Summary:</strong>

- Explore the front of the cheek, side of the nose, and top of the nose.</p>

<p><strong>Subdividing Planes:</strong>

- Subdivide planes for details like septal cartilage and nostrils.

- Use overlaps to help with foreshortening.</p>

<h2>Perspective and Proportions</h2>

<p><strong>Perspective Alignment:</strong>

- Ensure perspective alignment between forms.

- Use proportion systems to avoid rethinking measurements.</p>

<p><strong>Surface Symmetry:</strong>

- Adjust the center line for surface symmetry.</p>

<h2>Lighting and Shadows</h2>

<p><strong>Lighting Effects:</strong>

- Consider lighting effects on the front of the cheek and side of the nose.

- Create half tones or shadows across the tip of the nose.</p>

<p><strong>Enhancing Details:</strong>

- Use erasing to enhance overlaps and details.</p>

<h2>Building Facial Features</h2>

<p><strong>Starting Points:</strong>

- Start with the top, bottom, base of the nose, hairline, temple, and back of the skull.</p>

<p><strong>Defining Features:</strong>

- Define quarters, ear position, jaw lines, and rhythm.

- Build the T for the cheek and include overlaps for foreshortening.</p>

<h2>Final Adjustments</h2>

<p><strong>Proportions:</strong>

- Adjust the skull shape and hairline for better proportions.</p>

<p><strong>Review Steps:</strong>

- Review steps: temple, hairline, back of the skull, base of the nose, and quarters.

- Define the ear, cheek, jaw, and chin, considering the gland that produces saliva.</p>

<h2>Consistency and Realism</h2>

<p><strong>Perspective Orientation:</strong>

- Be consistent with perspective orientation.

- Think through surface choreography and how lines translate to value.</p>

<p><strong>Lighting Considerations:</strong>

- Consider lighting on the chin with catch light, halftone, and shadow.

- Push realism by thinking about lighting across smaller facets.</p>

<h2>Fun with Features</h2>

<p>After setting up the basic structure, be ready to have fun with features. Experiment with different artistic directions and enjoy the process of bringing your drawings to life.</p>
