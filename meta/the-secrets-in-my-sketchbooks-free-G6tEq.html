<h2>What's in Premium?</h2>

<p>In this lesson, I share how I use different types of sketchbooks for specific purposes. You'll learn how I created <strong>The Dynamic Bible</strong> using a Strathmore watercolor sketchbook, turning personal lecture notes and drawings into a published book. I'll show how travel sketchbooks like the <strong>Traveler's Journal</strong> can become visual journals that capture drawings, notes, and collected items from your journeys. We explore accordion sketchbooks and how they encourage thinking about transitions and the design of entire spreads. I discuss working with larger format sketchbooks and experimenting with different materials to focus on single imagery and illustration. We also cover the importance of observation, variation in subject matter, and building a personal connection with your sketchbooks and materials. This lesson aims to inspire you to give your sketchbooks purpose and use them as tools to document your artistic journey.</p>
