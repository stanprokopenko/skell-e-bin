<h2>Importance of Studying the Skull</h2>

<p>Studying the skull is crucial for enhancing your understanding of head construction. It provides a solid foundation for drawing heads, allowing you to integrate anatomical accuracy into your artwork.</p>

<h2>Tools and References</h2>

<p>To effectively study the skull, having a physical skull is highly recommended. While 3D viewers and programs can be useful, a physical skull offers a more tangible reference. The Proko skull is particularly recommended for its size and design.</p>

<h2>Basic Proportions and Shapes</h2>

<p>Start with a ball shape and transition to an egg shape for the cranial mass. Establish basic proportions to guide your drawing:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Halfway between the brow and chin</strong> is the nose.</li>

<li><strong>Halfway between the nose and brow</strong> is the bottom of the eye sockets.</li>

</ul>

<p>Identify the side plane by finding the temple and hairline.</p>

<h2>Drawing Different Parts of the Skull</h2>

<h3>Brow Area</h3>

<p>Use the brow area to tilt perspectives up or down. This helps in setting the overall orientation of the skull.</p>

<h3>Jaw</h3>

<p>Focus on the big parts around the outside of the jaw. Use figure eights or spheres to show ear and jaw placement. Draw the jaw shape with attention to its major forms.</p>

<h3>Cheekbone</h3>

<p>Use straight lines to build the curves of the cheekbone. Consider the perspective and thickness of the cheekbone as it curves forward, which can break the front and side plane design in head construction.</p>

<h3>Eye Socket</h3>

<p>The eye socket is rounded and spirals back, creating a cone shape. The bottom of the eye socket comes from the cheek.</p>

<h3>Nasal Saddle</h3>

<p>The nasal saddle attaches to the keystone and forms an upside-down heart shape. This area is crucial for defining the nose structure.</p>

<h3>Teeth</h3>

<p>Map the teeth rather than drawing them individually. Understand the structure of the bite, with molars and premolars in the back. The lower teeth are smaller to allow the mouth to close.</p>

<h3>Mandible</h3>

<p>The mandible has a mild box shape with teeth sitting on top. The jaw angle differs between males and females. The back of the jaw is close to the teeth and has depth and width.</p>

<h2>Integration into Head Construction</h2>

<p>Use the skull to inform your head construction rather than drawing it every time. Digest the information from the skull back into your drawing process. Abstract head construction using the Proko skull to identify big features.</p>

<h2>Tips and Considerations</h2>

<ul>

<li><strong>Think about interior parts</strong> early in the drawing process.</li>

<li><strong>Simplify the skull</strong> into manageable forms, avoiding excessive detail.</li>

<li><strong>Always ask questions</strong> while drawing to avoid mere copying.</li>

<li><strong>Focus on exploring surface and form</strong>, and avoid getting lost in hatching.</li>

<li><strong>Comparing human skulls to animal skulls</strong> can be insightful.</li>

</ul>

<p>By following these guidelines and integrating skull study into your practice, you'll improve your head construction skills and create more anatomically accurate drawings.</p>
