<h2>What's in Premium?</h2>

<p>In the premium lesson, you'll learn to create a head painting using the grid method, broken down into clear stages for accuracy. You'll need vine charcoal, a sandpaper pad, and a kneaded eraser. The grid method involves overlaying a grid on your reference photo and canvas, allowing you to focus on shapes rather than preconceived notions. You'll learn to select squares, focus on shapes, avoid overthinking, and connect the dots to form the image. This approach helps you draw accurately without relying on preconceived knowledge. Once your drawing is complete, you'll transition to painting with a solid foundation.</p>
