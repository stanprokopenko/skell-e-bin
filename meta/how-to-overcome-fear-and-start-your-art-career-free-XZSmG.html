<h2>What's in Premium?</h2>

<p>In this lesson, I share insights from my journey transitioning from student to professional artist. We discuss the importance of moving beyond the student mentality and expressing what you've learned in your own way. You'll learn how passion drives practice and why drawing what you love leads to better work.</p>

<p>We explore how to balance your artistic passions with making a living, dealing with failure, and the persistence needed to keep going. I explain how fundamental art principles apply across different mediums and how understanding different time frames changes your artistic approach.</p>

<p>I also introduce my beginner painting course, where we break down the painting process into manageable steps. Starting with drawing and mapping out the subject, separating lights from shadows, and mixing simple colors using just four paints, this course aims to build your confidence and skills in an accessible way.</p>
