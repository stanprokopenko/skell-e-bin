<h2>What's in Premium?</h2>

<p>Learn how to adapt your gesture drawing techniques to handle challenging poses in this lesson. We focus on simplifying figures to their bare essentials, emphasizing fundamental movements and rhythms. You'll discover how to introduce subtle asymmetry in symmetrical poses to avoid stiffness and use curves—like C-curves and S-curves—and straights strategically to represent different body parts. We explore the importance of understanding weight and balance by adjusting poses and shifting the center of gravity. You'll also learn how to incorporate anatomical details at key focal points without disrupting the overall rhythm. The lesson encourages experimentation, pushing diagonals, exaggerating tilts, and applying these methods universally across different body types and even animals. We highlight the value of repetition and timed practice to build familiarity, all while keeping a playful and exploratory approach to your gesture drawing.</p>
