<p><strong>My name is Matt Wilson, also credited as Matthew Wilson sometimes.</strong> I've colored too many Marvel comics to list them all. My current series are <strong>Thor, Daredevil, and Scarlet Witch</strong>. Notable series I've colored include <strong>Black Widow, The Runaways, and Young Avengers</strong>. I had a long stretch on <strong>Secret Avengers</strong>, where editors joked it was Black Widow and myself as the longest-serving Secret Avengers.</p>

<h2>Career Journey</h2>

<p>I got my first job as an assistant for another colorist in the spring of 2003. As of spring 2023, I have been in the industry for 20 years. A friendâ€™s dad took him to the comic store, which led me to start buying Marvel series cards and X-Men cards drawn by Jim Lee. My mom saw some extreme 90s comics and took them away, leading to a soft ban on comics.</p>

<p>In college, I realized I wasn't passionate enough to be a comic artist but did well in a comics coloring class. A professor introduced us to a professional comics colorist in town, leading me to work as his assistant after graduation.</p>

<h2>Notable Projects</h2>

<p>One standout project was a 12-issue run of <strong>Black Widow</strong>, which felt like a complete, encapsulated story. Another standout was <strong>Young Avengers</strong>, where the creative team had a cohesive voice from script to lettering. I met writers and artists at conventions, leading to my name being suggested to Marvel editors by multiple people around the same time. <strong>Esad Ribic</strong>, an artist who used to paint his own comics pages, had a <strong>Loki series</strong> that stands out to me.</p>

<h2>Coloring Process</h2>

<p><strong>Flatting</strong> is the process of laying in flat colors, often the first step in coloring. I started as a flatter for another colorist and later flatted my own work. Using a flatter saves time, allowing me to focus on coloring different books. Marvel sends me black and white pages, which I send to a flatter to separate all sections with flat colors. I set a palette for the scene and save it as my flat layer for future reference. The final page includes gradients, brushstrokes, painting, and special effects. Flats are useful for making corrections, as they allow easy selection of specific elements.</p>

<p>Some days, figuring out a palette can be the hardest part, while other days, it comes easily. The initial color setting is crucial for building a good base before adding fancy effects. There isn't just one way to color a comic; different styles can be successful.</p>

<h2>Insights and Advice</h2>

<p>Early in my career, I thought I wouldn't color for Marvel because my style was different, but I learned to focus on being a good colorist in my own voice. <strong>Laura Martin</strong>, a colorist I admired, showed me that different styles can work in the industry. If I could tell my younger self anything, it would be to focus on being a good colorist and expressing my voice, as the rest will fall into place.</p>
