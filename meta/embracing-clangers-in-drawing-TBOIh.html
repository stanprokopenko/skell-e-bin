<p>Welcome back! Today, we're going to explore some <strong>clangers</strong>. We'll get our clangers out, which are experimental marks, and we'll call those marks <strong>figures</strong>. We'll draw lots and lots of figures, <strong>without a care in the world</strong>.</p>

<p>I believe the most stultifying thing for any artist is trying to do a good drawing, expecting it to happen by magic. The real magic is in the <strong>mileage</strong>. If we get some mileage on that paper, get some clangers in there, and give ourselves the grace that these are <strong>not supposed to be great drawings</strong>, well hey, the magic happens, we end up with great drawings.</p>

<h2>Starting with Clangers</h2>

<p>I recommend this for everyone, <strong>Start a page of clangers</strong> as you go, with all the grace in the world, to draw without worrying that anyone would ever look at it or criticize it. Our hand will, by osmosis, become a work of wonder. So, we'll fill a page full of clangers, then we'll get back into drawing some figures based on the <strong>hand memory</strong> that those clangers brought, all those wonderful, confident strokes because they were never meant to be anything other than an experiment.</p>

<p>That <strong>experiment</strong> is going to lend your hand some great quality. Let's get into it, and I wish you the best for your clangers. <strong>Enjoy them.</strong> It's the most wonderful thing in the world.</p>

<h2>Techniques and Methods</h2>

<h3>Using Broad and Fine Strokes</h3>

<p>Here I am with my 1710 Cante a Paris pencil, making my first marks. You might see a little dirty mark there, but I don't worry about that stuff. Once I've got my pencil and paper, my focus is all about the drawing, and anything that impedes that is ignored.</p>

<p>As I draw with this pencil, I'm constantly lifting my fingers up for a <strong>point</strong>, and placing the palm back down for a <strong>broad</strong>. You learn to do this. An easy method is to think, <strong>broad is for heavy or thick things</strong>. Once you have that in your mind, you have the beginnings of style, something the camera can't do, but we can.</p>

<h3>Drawing with Rhythm</h3>

<p>I'm drawing with <strong>rhythm</strong>, another concept, another great idea. Look how we can get a really fast little drawing in there, based on the rhythm of shapes.</p>

<h3>Methods and Mnemonics</h3>

<p>Every time we start doesn't mean we have to start in exactly the same method, but <strong>we have methods</strong>. For example, we can have <strong>Mrs. V</strong> in a frontal pose and then ask ourselves where the <strong>linea alba</strong> is, which is the line running through the navel up to the sternum. Once you understand where those are, you can note that the pose is slightly not full front. And you can change that at any point. <strong>We're shape shifters</strong>.</p>

<p>I'm thinking about the <strong>Liberty Bell</strong> being elongated down to the bottom of the knees. Remember, from the <strong>greater trochanter</strong> to the bottom of the knees, it is <strong>two head lengths</strong>. So, where Mrs. V ends, two head lengths down to the bottom of the knee, that is just, once again, a <strong>ballpark figure</strong>. It doesn't have to be exact.</p>

<h2>Understanding Proportions and Angles</h2>

<p>There's <strong>number nine</strong>. Number nine is tilted. In goes the <strong>ear</strong>. The ear is a great placement to say <strong>is the head up or is the head down</strong>. Where you place that will tell you what's going on. <strong>Head up, ears down. Head down, ears up</strong>. Then you can place the eyes and the nose wherever you like. I just rudimentarily placed it any place I like there, with the ability now to change it if I want.</p>

<p>I want to see how the pose is going. Remember, I <strong>orbit the head around the bigger objects</strong>.</p>

<h2>Experimenting with Shapes</h2>

<p>Note another change of pace here. I have put the <strong>shoulders in</strong>, not as two beans. So it's a different shape now. You can almost say, and I see this shape many times as I'm drawing, that you're looking at a little kind of face there with ears. It's a little bit like the <strong>flour sack</strong>, and that's why the flour sack is so important, because the ears of the flour sack represent where the arms would be.</p>

<p>There's the moment where these two shapes overlap and become the upper abs and navel area. And then down we go. The distances between the <strong>upper abs and lower abs</strong> can vary. This is a shorter distance for this figure.</p>

<h2>Embracing Variations</h2>

<p>Don't be disturbed if you look at a model and things are slightly different from the ballpark. That's what the ballpark is for, it tells you where the placement would generally be. And when you go too far off that, with all this mileage, you'll see that immediately and ask yourself, <strong>are we breaking the laws of nature?</strong> **</p>

<p>There's only so far we can push to the point where we say there's not another person on earth with this kind of length or shortness, and then it looks weird. But the difference in lengths of legs, arms, and torsos is quite varied. So we've got a lot of give in there. <strong>You'll know when</strong>. That's what mileage is all about, it trains your eye to see something that's really too far gone.</p>

<p>Now, having said that, as long as the <strong>hierarchy</strong> is there, you can then <strong>stylize</strong>. We're talking about realism for that idea. Let's say you want to stylize, you can really stretch those things out. As long as the <strong>navel is always below the upper abs</strong>, and that the <strong>iliac crest is below the lower abs</strong>. It can be right on it, but as long as it's not above.</p>

<h2>Filling the Page with Clangers</h2>

<p>A little back view here, I'm going to <strong>fill a page</strong>. I love to start drawings on a page that already has something on it. And the reason for that is that it's not a blank page, obviously. You often hear the term <strong>the fear of the empty canvas</strong>, and it is a real fear.</p>

<p>Before I go further, I just put in a little broad darkness where the <strong>rib cage meets the bottom of the tube</strong>, and that's where the rib cage <strong>goes in really fast</strong> before it comes back out again as the <strong>gluteus</strong>. So I'm indicating broad terms there.</p>

<p>Working with only line is tricky because the distances are so vast, but when you put <strong>broad strokes</strong> down, the distances become less vast.</p>

<h2>Understanding Anatomy in Motion</h2>

<p>There's a big broad shape for the <strong>scapula</strong> there. When the arm goes up, the scapula turns. So the scapula has now moved to a 45-degree angle there, roughly, because it is a <strong>hydraulic system</strong> and it's lifted that arm up.</p>

<p>Now to prove that point, I'm going to bring an arm down. And I don't have to swing up from the navel there to get the crook of the arm because after a while those tools are subliminal. You'll put most of them in at the beginning, but after a while, you can leave some out. If you leave them all out, though, what tends to happen is you <strong>forget the fundamentals</strong>. So I'll often put them in even if I don't need them, just to make sure that the <strong>subconscious art engine</strong> is strong.</p>

<h3>The Forward Tilt of the Neck</h3>

<p>Pushing forward for the neck, remember, the <strong>neck goes forward</strong>. The neck is fitting into the top of the rib cage, which is tilted backwards, and that's the reason for the tilt forwards of the neck. So remember, the neck is always tilted forward, it's not a pipe that sticks up from the rib cage, and that's great for us because everything's beautiful.</p>

<h3>Pinches and Stretches</h3>

<p>Feeling that big <strong>pinch</strong>. When you start drawing, you could always write <strong>S and P</strong> on each side to identify where the <strong>stretches</strong> are and where the <strong>pinches</strong> are. But on shapes like this where you really see the pinch very easily, there's not really much need for that. But it's not always that simple.</p>

<h3>Experimenting with Forms</h3>

<p>Now with <strong>pentimento</strong>, look how much give I'm giving on these <strong>gluteus</strong>. I want to see how much I can push them to get that <strong>squash</strong>. So <strong>bend and squash and stretch</strong>, all that stuff from animation. And look how it really gives the idea of <strong>heaviness</strong>.</p>

<p>Now these are <strong>relative clangers</strong>, by the way. These drawings are <strong>meant to be great</strong>. I'm filling a page. So I fill a page full of clangers, which are just exploratory drawings, and I'm not really that concerned with getting anything accurate. I just want to <strong>explore the ballpark ideas</strong> of where a leg would go if I was to decide to bring it up or drop it down.</p>

<p>When a leg is extended, the gluteus become longer, they don't really become longer, they just show their full length. And when you're sitting down, you're sitting on those <strong>sit bones</strong>, and so the gluteus are compressed, and we don't see as much volume.</p>

<h3>Using Mnemonics</h3>

<p>You can see here, using my many <strong>mnemonics</strong> to find all these wonderful ideas. So we bend at the <strong>navel and the upper abs</strong>. Anywhere above that crest, I can start pulling that tube forward and then add all those elements onto it. There's a <strong>head down and a head up</strong>. It's just a line and a circle.</p>

<p>If you're working on comic books, believe me, that is the road to freedom right there. How simple can you make it? And look how simple that is.</p>

<p>And over we go again to the other side. Now, that looks like it's coming out from below the waist, but remember, we're <strong>looking around a corner</strong> here. It's a little bit more complicated, but you'll know when it breaks, when it's too much or too little. The main thing is to remember you're coming off of that waist.</p>

<h2>Building Confidence in Drawing</h2>

<p>Where would I put that arm at this point? Well, there you go. I mean, that is an incredibly complicated idea from imagination, but it works. If you're drawing comic books and you do lots and lots of these, you can do a whole sequence of panels with a character that you really understand the shape of and the dimensions of and start doing <strong>sequential storytelling</strong>.</p>

<p>One of the biggest problems with sequential storytelling is people can't, to begin with, make the character obviously the same character from panel to panel.</p>

<p>It was all getting very muddy there. I put some legs and feet in, and it started getting too muddy to explain the idea, and so I move across and do another drawing. But there was a ton of <strong>mileage</strong> in there as far as movement, animation, and the principles of what we've been learning here, which is <strong>we're the boss</strong>. We're the boss of everything once we learn these simple shapes and put them into action.</p>

<h2>Learning from Other Artists</h2>

<p>Look at how beautifully this went in. And this is starting to resemble now, way down the line, when you see a <strong>John Buscema</strong> drawing. They look like this. John Buscema, American comic book artist, he illustrated <strong>Conan</strong> for years.</p>

<h3>The Role of the Inker</h3>

<p>To begin with, he would give the <strong>inker</strong>, because the artist didn't always ink their own pencils, put ink on top, he would give the inker a detailed drawing. After a while, he was so fast and was so much in demand that he started doing <strong>lay-ins</strong>, which is what this looked like. So he really needed a great inker because the inker would have to <strong>embellish everything</strong> that they couldn't see in the details, out of the details.</p>

<p>So the inker was usually an established artist to begin with, someone like <strong>Neal Adams</strong> or <strong>Pablo Marcos</strong>. People who could draw already, and they didn't always get as much work, say, as John Buscema in the beginning of their career, that is. And so they would supplement their income with inks, and they would ink on top of John Buscema.</p>

<h3>The Hierarchy of Artist and Student</h3>

<p>And everyone wins because then you learn from John Buscema, a lot like what we're doing here by <strong>osmosis</strong>. It's an incredible opportunity for everyone. For John to draw more, make more income, and for other artists to learn from John. Just as you're learning from me here, and I learned from him. So there's the <strong>hierarchy of artist and student</strong>. And the student becomes the teacher.</p>

<h2>Overcoming Challenges</h2>

<p>Just finding my way through a figure that could work. It's a little broken on the side there, but remember these are <strong>clangers</strong>. What I mean by broken is that it's not really reading the way it should. A bit of <strong>pentimento</strong> in there to see if I can get that ribcage less broad, and then coming down for all the stuff I really know, up to the <strong>acromion process</strong> and then up to the <strong>trapezius</strong>.</p>

<p>Finding that elbow joint is a hard line. Breaking the <strong>deltoid</strong> is one of the hardest things. You look for the pinch of the acromion process to do that.</p>

<p>So I'm looking through the figure there, so don't be confused by the fact that that arm seems to be coming right off the back. I'm actually <strong>drawing through</strong>.</p>

<p>So out of this clanger stuff, it's just for yourself. You don't have to explain it, but since I'm doing this as a demo as well, I better explain what happened there.</p>

<h3>Learning from Mistakes</h3>

<p>So if a drawing starts to go off the rails, just start another one and <strong>learn from that one</strong>. Ask yourself what it was that was so tricky there and keep it in your mind and make a note on the page. I often make notes to say <strong>explore this more</strong> or <strong>what's wrong here</strong>, <strong>what happened there</strong>, that kind of thing.</p>

<p>I was teaching a class once on a sitting figure. I suddenly realized I didn't know as much as I thought I did. I had to stop the class and say, <strong>guys, I'm at the end of my knowledge here, I have to explore this myself</strong>. And it was a very honest thing to say, but I didn't want to leave an impression that that's how you drew something.</p>

<h3>Teaching Makes You a Better Artist</h3>

<p>So I went back and I started to draw lots and lots of needle figures like this, needle figures that showed that compression, and found out the problem was I didn't truly understand the <strong>sit bones</strong> and the fact that the sit bones have that big push out toward the <strong>greater trochanter</strong> and then a quick curve in toward the underside of the leg.</p>

<p>And once I did 20 of these, I went, <strong>wow, never again shall I make that error</strong>. And the class actually, they really did appreciate the fact that I didn't lie to them. A teacher is not the font of all knowledge, and I see teachers frightened that they can't answer every question. <strong>Teaching will make you a better artist</strong>. That certainly made me one.</p>

<p>And if you don't have to explain it to anyone, you might just ignore it and never address the issue like I had to. But look at the freedom that came from that one hiccup in my teaching career.</p>

<h2>The Joy of Filling a Page</h2>

<p>I can draw this from imagination, and it actually reads as quite a substantial figure that rings true. As a schematic, of course, I'd have to embellish that more and more to get all the minutia in there for it to be something that you could finish.</p>

<p>But what a wonder <strong>filling a sheet of paper</strong> is. I recommend this thoroughly, and you'll see that because the figures are already on the page and you're not flipping from one page to another, you get very fluid.</p>

<p>That's why I never really kept a <strong>sketchbook</strong>. I didn't really feel that you had that freedom of a big page. Although I'm not saying don't get a sketchbook, it just wasn't for me. Because it was so intimidating to keep turning onto a fresh page. But a big sheet of <strong>newsprint</strong> like this, look what I'm able to do now.</p>

<h2>The Magic of Mileage</h2>

<p>This drawing is way, way better than any of the drawings that I've done until this point. It's established itself as a better iteration of how I'm drawing within <strong>18 minutes</strong>. So incredible, really. What a great use of time.</p>

<p>All the <strong>ballpark themes</strong> are being hit here, but don't think that it's a hack thing either, because every time I make these little ballpark moments, they're slightly different from the last one. It's just given me the <strong>subconscious power</strong> that I need going forward for any drawing.</p>

<p>And every time I do these drawings, I ask myself, <strong>can I make it a little better?</strong> Can I make each of these lines better? ** So say I was to embellish this drawing. That head is a little bit askew, it's a bit weird. I would have to do a lot of work in there.</p>

<p>But I've got enough stuff in there, in a very short time, to be able to do that. <strong>Ghost it back</strong>. Play around with it. Already it's starting to look better, isn't it? It's quite characteristic of people I know. And now with the expression of the mouth and the eyes, it really is starting to look like a character that <strong>suffers no fools</strong>, especially with the pose as well. Hands on hips, it's always quite arrogant.</p>

<p>Move the nose up and start to establish something a little bit better each time. Now that I've got the idea in mind, you can start with an idea and then establish it further. If you sit down and just try and think about ideas, that's okay too. But there's nothing like <strong>making marks</strong> to bring ideas forward.</p>

<p>If I were to sit and just think of ideas all day, I might not draw at all. But the second you make a mark, the ideas come flooding out. And that's why clangers are so great.</p>

<p><strong>Remember, a clanger is a drawing that no one else is supposed to see</strong>. It's for you to just basically fill a page full of marks and see where it goes. A little bit like <strong>streams of consciousness</strong>. But your conscious here is very strong.</p>

<p>And remember, every one of these drawings is getting more and more finessed. You saw <strong>latissimus</strong> going in there and then shifting to the <strong>serratus</strong> and <strong>rib cage</strong> in a very fluid moment. Same with the <strong>biceps femoris</strong> down to the <strong>fibula bone</strong> on the calves. Look at all that lovely <strong>pentimento</strong> to play around with different hip shapes. It's the most wonderful thing.</p>

<h2>Avoiding Preciousness</h2>

<p>Now you may say, <strong>wow, if I do a nice drawing like that, I want to keep it. I wish I had done this in a sketch pad</strong>. Once you start thinking like that, you're starting to be <strong>precious</strong>. There'll be plenty of drawings that are good, and they'll most likely come from doing this. So leave that to the end of the day and pull out your <strong>moleskine</strong> and make those drawings the last drawings you do. And it'll have all this mileage in it.</p>

<p>You can see how this drawing, like I say, is much more <strong>fluid</strong> than the ones before, especially the one next to it, which is really a clanger to be honest. It started well, and then I got too mechanical with it on the shoulders.</p>

<p>And all of it is terrific. <strong>All of it teaches us something</strong>, especially the stuff that doesn't work. So always the <strong>deltoid</strong>, bigger than you think, to lift that arm up. The <strong>acromion process</strong> would pinch, actually, where the first shoulder finished there. Acromion process is the <strong>scapula</strong>. It's the end of the scapula at the front.</p>

<h2>Anecdotes and Observations</h2>

<p>I was in a museum once across from a college that I taught in - Natural History Museum - and a woman was cleaning a giant <strong>scapula</strong>. And I said, <strong>is that the scapula of a whale?</strong> ** She was stunned. I said, I teach anatomy across the street. And we had a great conversation. And it was wonderful.</p>

<p>Imagine what it was like for her to be doing this job in solitary confinement almost, and then to meet someone that she can talk to about this incredible thing she's doing, preservation of a whale scapula. Never forget that day. It's marvelous.</p>

<h2>Creating Characters from Shapes</h2>

<p>Now look what I've done here, fleshed these hips. Haven't changed the top at all. But look, we've all met someone like this, haven't we? All of these shapes work in different ways, and you create <strong>different characters</strong>.</p>

<p>And I have met so many women like this. A woman will put their weight on <strong>below the waist</strong>, and a man will put the weight in <strong>above the waist</strong>. That's generally the way figures work. Male and female figures differ.</p>

<p>So all the power is in the woman's legs, and I love playing with <strong>wide hips</strong> to see what we get. Lots of models like this. No matter how lean they are, they always have wide hips and wide thighs. No matter how much work they do on that, it's a <strong>genetic thing</strong>.</p>

<p>I have a friend, and she says it's all <strong>pasta down there</strong>, and she's very athletic. Her <strong>serratus</strong> really show, and her <strong>intercostals</strong> as well. Unusual to see that, and yet always the thighs are very heavy on the outside. Amazing model.</p>

<p>I'm pulling the leg up there just for a bit of fun, to have a look at it. And look how <strong>normal</strong> the person has become. It's like an everyday person now, isn't it? It was very regal, the pose with the two knees and one leg going back. And you lift the leg up like that, and it's like someone, <strong>they're about to manicure their toes</strong> or something. So a <strong>pose tells a whole story</strong>. Different kinds of poses for different occasions.</p>

<p>But generally, I work in <strong>fantasy art</strong>, and so I'll do a lot of warriors, I'll do a lot of princesses, a lot of princes, a lot of kings, things like that, and barbarians, and of course <strong>monstrous</strong> types.</p>

<h2>The Osmosis Library</h2>

<p>This is all about the female figure and the power of <strong>osmosis</strong>, and we'll do one on the male figure. And we'll collect that down into a whole series of different ideas to see what we get.</p>

<p>But the main thing is this <strong>osmosis library</strong> is what's going to make you the artist that has expedited the journey that took me 30 years into a much, much shorter time.</p>

<h2>Practical Tips and Techniques</h2>

<h3>Sharpening Your Pencil</h3>

<p>I just got a bit of <strong>grit</strong> on the pencil there and moved it across to really do two things: to get the grit away and to make the pencil a better pencil. So the pencil adapts its curves to your hand. So that pencil is <strong>perfectly suited for me now</strong> because I've been drawing with it and it's now been reshaped into the kind of position that I've put it into where it always knows the broad shapes and the thin shapes.</p>

<p>So I'm basically <strong>sharpening this pencil on the page</strong> to be the best pencil for me, the perfect pencil. And that's why it's quite small, because the pencil, like a good brush, becomes a better pencil as you draw with it.</p>

<p>**Straight out of the box, it's a horrible thing to draw with. ** So always sharpen your pencil when you get it out of the box. Drawing with the pencil as it just comes out of the box is kind of pointless, just for taking notes with, really.</p>

<p>So, <strong>sharpen your pencils</strong>. At least that length of lead, I think, if you want all these broad to thin strokes. If you see <strong>Jeff Watts</strong>' pencils, the leads are like four times longer than that. For me, that's too much because I can't really get up onto that point, maybe he's got longer fingers. I don't know, but this is perfect for me. That's a perfect size lead for me.</p>

<h3>The Gestural Hand vs. the Detail Hand</h3>

<p>Now every once in a while, mix it up a little bit. Do a little small drawing. Notice I'm getting closer to the end of the pencil because the drawing is smaller.</p>

<p>I always fight against having to use the <strong>detail hand</strong>. So for me, the detail hand will only be used if I can no longer get any more out of this <strong>gestural hand</strong>. The gestural hand with the wrist pivoting to the elbow and the elbow to the shoulder gives you so much <strong>hydraulic fluidity</strong>. It just cannot be replicated with the detail hand.</p>

<p>This is what you use to <strong>write notes</strong> because you're balancing on a tightrope, you're balancing on a point of a pencil. Here, my hand is always in connection with the paper. It could be by a finger, a palm, or all the fingers.</p>

<p>You might go, well I don't see any smudge in there. Look, that little face went in beautifully, didn't it? I'm so happy with that. You get all these little <strong>wins</strong> that make you so happy, and it's from the <strong>mileage</strong> that your hand starts to get lighter and you make less smudgy marks.</p>

<p>If it does make smudges, they're so small and so useful later because they're darkening the page a little bit for you to rub back into with an eraser if you need to.</p>

<h3>Fixatives</h3>

<p>One of the critiques on a book of mine was he never used the <strong>fixative</strong>. It was like I hid it, but I don't use the fixative, and that's the reason it was never mentioned. So you can use fixative. If your hand's getting too heavy on the page, then fix it. What I recommend, though, is a <strong>reworkable fixative</strong>.</p>

<p>And I don't like spraying things anyway, you know, it's not as good for your health. But a reworkable fixative, you can still erase back pretty easy.</p>

<p>If I do end up spraying the page that has a great drawing on it, I'll take it outside and I'll hold the fixative at arm's length, and I'll spray in big swathes with my breath held, and then I'll come straight back indoors again. <strong>Never spray indoors.</strong></p>

<h3>Exploring Further</h3>

<p>So you've got a page here. <strong>Scoot around and see with a fresh eye what else you can do.</strong> That's a lovely little character now, isn't it? And there's still some more grit on that pencil.</p>

<p>Another thing you can do as well, if you're getting rid of the grit, is go and <strong>shade somewhere</strong>. I wanted to put some extra <strong>carpal ramp</strong> in there, push it to its limit. That's its limit, but isn't it nice? It's getting a little floppy now, but it's still nice.</p>

<p>So I'll push it till it breaks, and sometimes, you know, the broken part, you just leave it. It looks fine. Look at artists like <strong>Eliza</strong>, for instance. She pushes it to the limit. The gesture is so powerful in those drawings.</p>

<h2>Warming Up and Staying Fluid</h2>

<p>So there we have a big page full of some <strong>clangers</strong> to begin with and some successes based on the clangers. Alright, so we're well oiled up.</p>

<p>So you can call that page the <strong>first thing you do in a day</strong>. The first page of the day. It doesn't mean you can't start with a structural drawing to just get your mind right like I did.</p>

<p>But a <strong>page full of gestural drawings</strong> is really what you need to get into before you start drawing, I believe anyway. And then you can get into a little bit of structure like this without losing that <strong>gestural hand</strong>.</p>

<p>So the gestural hand from that previous page full of drawings is still very fresh in my hand, so I'm able to draw structurally here with a <strong>gestural flow</strong>. That's exactly what we want. Look how beautifully gestural those structures are.</p>

<h2>Foot Anatomy Tips</h2>

<p>That's like a little signature there, isn't it? With a big toe going across to the <strong>condyles</strong> on the other side. Remember, the <strong>big toe is on the inside</strong>. You might go, come on Patrick, who doesn't know that? Well, watch how many times you mess that up, especially when you do crossed legs, and you'll see what I mean.</p>

<p>So <strong>big toe on the inside</strong>, <strong>arch on the inside</strong>, <strong>flat foot on the outside</strong>. So let me put her feet flat on the floor. From the outside where the little toe is, there's no gap.</p>

<h2>Different Approaches to Drawing</h2>

<p>You can do anything. You can do sticks like this as long as you've got a <strong>gestural hand</strong> going. Another great artist I love to watch draw is called <strong>Karl Gnass</strong>. So Karl Gnass draws with sticks, and he elaborates off those sticks with gesture.</p>

<p>I do gesture and elaborate off the gesture with sticks, with straights, let's say. So I put the <strong>structure in after</strong>, and he puts the structure in first. And it works. It works for both of us. The two of us are doing two separate things, and both of them work fine. Absolutely fine.</p>

<h2>Working on Areas</h2>

<p>So here I go in here to find the <strong>up arm</strong> and the <strong>deltoid</strong> in the <strong>number 9</strong>, all in one little area. So you can start working in areas all the way down if you like, once you've got your stuff in.</p>

<p>So if the big shapes look good, you can move your weight on the figure in a <strong>rhythm</strong> like this. So put it in and rhythm it all the way down. Rhythm it all the way down and <strong>have fun with it</strong>.</p>

<p>I rarely get the eraser on, but I felt the need for it there. But if you get that eraser out, <strong>set your spider senses on full alert</strong>. That's not something you've got to do every time.</p>

<h2>Slowing Down and Focusing</h2>

<p>So moving down the figure and feeling that this drawing wasn't as easy as I first thought. But bringing a little bit of gesture back in with that navel. And always remember this, that whatever drawing you're doing, if it's not really working, <strong>you're still a better artist than you were the drawing before that did work</strong>. You just ended up in a bit of a muddle. Maybe you started thinking about your grocery list or something.</p>

<p>I always say to myself <strong>compartmentalize this drawing experience</strong> and say here's an hour and that's all you're doing. Turn everything off and go draw. And you can see how I <strong>slowed down</strong> there because I was aware of the fact that I was rushing ahead beyond the speed of my thoughts, and now we got a lovely leg in there.</p>

<p>Based on me setting off my spider senses and saying <strong>slow down</strong>, it's not a race. And start thinking a little bit more about your drawing and less about everything else.</p>

<h3>Drawing in Public</h3>

<p>That's why it's hard for teachers to do a demo. You've got to cut a break for them. Because when they're doing demos, they've got to be thinking about the students and everything else, and so a demo is really, what is it, <strong>50% as good as it could be</strong> because you don't have that mindset of <strong>this is only me and the drawing</strong>.</p>

<p>It's not an excuse, I'm just letting you know when you become a teacher not to be frightened of the fact that your drawings aren't coming together like they do at home. That's just the natural state of things, and once you have that grace for yourself, then they actually <strong>do pick up a little bit better</strong>.</p>

<p>And the more you <strong>draw in public</strong>, the less that hindrance will be, and you'll start drawing better again. Draw with people watching as much as you can, and you'll soon realize that it's not that frightening and <strong>everybody loves whatever marks you make</strong>.</p>

<p>Most people, they don't see your bad lines, they just see <strong>magic</strong>. No matter what stage you're at, because most people can't draw. They can't draw as well as a first-year student. So wherever you are, people are going to love your drawings.</p>

<p>You go and draw in the park, you'll soon have people look over your shoulder. I was teaching my students down in the <strong>South Bank Parklands</strong>, a little college I taught in was across the street from that. We went out to draw people.</p>

<p>And I felt this weight on my shoulder and there was a whirr, a sound, and I looked over and there was a <strong>Japanese tourist</strong> who had just got off a coach, and he was resting his, didn't mean to, but he was resting his camcorder on my shoulder. And all the Japanese people who got off the coach with him were standing behind him. And I looked around, and he smiled.</p>

<p>So think about that. They were there to see Australia and they diverted from the marvels of Australia, the blue sky, the beautiful park, to see this drawing happen. And it was a wonder to them. <strong>People love art, so go share it</strong>.</p>

<h2>Handling Complexity</h2>

<p>I've told myself to slow down and you can see I'm working slower here. It's actually a <strong>complicated thing</strong>, you know. We bent the figure, we're lifting an arm up, we're dropping an arm down. We've dropped the head down. All of this is tricky stuff.</p>

<p>So even though we're still in clanger world, we're starting to get something good out of it. That <strong>tenth rib</strong> coming up. So I am slowing right down here for this. So beautiful little moments here.</p>

<p>And you see the upper abs end and the navel straight in. Now look what happened as I moved on. I was able to say well, you know what, those first initial marks were a little off, but that's okay. Coming down the figure and knowing the <strong>hierarchy of things</strong> means I could make that adjustment.</p>

<p>Now imagine if you did a massive amount of details in there and you find that odd. So you've got to really think of the <strong>holistic nature of things</strong> to get a drawing that works as a beautiful thing that flows.</p>

<p>I'm keeping that little drawing on the left there to show you that that's the important thing. <strong>What's underneath those structural, gestural shapes are more important than anything</strong>.</p>

<p>And don't be frightened of <strong>pentimento</strong>. I mean, that looks a little bit like the <strong>hairy hand</strong>. What the hairy hand is, is when you draw with a detailed hand and you have to scratch multiple times to get a line because your detailed hand only allows you so much length.</p>

<p>Whereas the <strong>gestural hand</strong>, look how I move that hand all the way down the page because I'm using <strong>my arm, not my hand</strong>, to get length of line. Try it and you'll see what I mean. If you're tightrope walking on the tip of a pencil, you can't go far with it. But when you're drawing from the <strong>shoulder</strong>, you can make a gigantic circle, for instance, on a large canvas.</p>

<p>The gestural hand was probably the most important change I ever made in drawing, and I made it very late actually. I used to draw in small for advertising, and once I started doing big canvases again, I just realized how powerful the gestural hand was.</p>

<p>When you're working on small canvases, you know, I still use a gestural hand. But you can use the detail hand and not really suffer too much. But I <strong>suffer all the time with it now</strong>.</p>

<p>So look how close I am to the tip. I'm doing smaller stuff. And now that becomes the detail hand but in a gestural grip.</p>

<p>So, <strong>at your peril</strong>, draw with the detail hand. And yet, some artists do it. And they're fine. But they tend to always be drawing small.</p>

<h2>Combining Gesture and Structure</h2>

<p>So shoulders downwards, very gestural stance here but structural at the same time. So the <strong>gesture</strong> is in the bend and in the pose of the arms. The <strong>structure</strong> is in the long leg balancing the figure and the angle of the raised leg resting on something solid. So the bottom part of this figure is solid and the top of it can do anything it likes now because it has those bendy bits.</p>

<p>Look at the <strong>pentimento</strong> in there to find an arm I like. Lifting it up. Re-establishing the <strong>egg</strong> here to overlap, and down we go. And the <strong>iliac crest</strong> getting hidden behind that <strong>rectus femoris</strong>.</p>

<p>Sometimes I just <strong>ghost back</strong> with the back of my hand. And the reason why I did that is because I didn't really need that much ghosting back, just enough. I would have broken the spell to reach for another thing, like the tissue or the chamois. I try and keep focus on the page as much as possible.</p>

<h3>Remembering Proportions</h3>

<p>Now remember the <strong>deltoid</strong>, about a hand's length. It'll equate with a swing up from the <strong>nipples</strong> there with those arms swinging out. And as the arm comes in, then it'll come down a little lower. So I was thinking of that <strong>swing out</strong> idea.</p>

<p>Swing out from the <strong>navel</strong> for the <strong>crook of the arm</strong>. That hand that's on the waist, that arm is going back in space. It's shorter. It can't be the length you want anymore. There's <strong>foreshortening</strong> involved. That's why we can't swing up to the crook there.</p>

<p>So ask yourself all the time, <strong>is the arm foreshortened? Is it hanging down or is it going back? Is the elbow going back?</strong> Then that forearm is going to be shorter, and also the top of the arm on the right-hand side is going to be shorter too. So it's going back in space.</p>

<h3>Ghosting in Features</h3>

<p><strong>Ghosting in</strong> a little face here. I used to put the eyes, nose, and mouth in and then ask myself, <strong>is it going to be a wide jaw? Is it going to be narrow? Is it going to be a square jaw? What am I going to do here? Small chin?</strong> Anything you like is possible. So I get the little ghosted face in first. Notice I put the faces in very faint because I know they're going to have lots of change in them. And I'll often wipe back a face to have another go.</p>

<p>I love that little <strong>bob hairstyle</strong>. I always did. There's just something so posh about it. And that identifies a character right away. So that nipple's a little bit off. That should be off-center more. But these are <strong>fast drawings</strong>, and they're not to be over-critiqued. Just be a testament to the <strong>fluidity</strong> of what we're doing here.</p>

<p>In fact, I can say that, it means that it's really not a crippling thing because I can always come back and correct at any point I want. I want to keep the drawing <strong>fresh and alive</strong>, and I'll move across like that without being burdened by mechanics.</p>

<h2>Embracing Imperfection</h2>

<p>So if you look at the old masters' drawings and any great artist, you'll see their drawings are a little <strong>askew</strong> here and there, but the <strong>hierarchy</strong> is always there. Things are in the <strong>ballpark</strong>. Probably one of the ills of being a student is trying to make everything so perfect that your drawing ends up with <strong>no life</strong> to it.</p>

<p>Remember, anything can be corrected in that ballpark area. But what is correction? It's often stultifying if you correct too much. As long as it's <strong>fluid and within the region</strong> you need it to be, it will be a nice drawing for people to look at. As long as it's got <strong>your style</strong> in it. And the style comes from the fluidity, for me, anyhow. Your style might be completely structural, and that's fine too. Everything's up for grabs.</p>

<p>But I want my figures to <strong>live</strong>. I want them to be <strong>alive</strong>. I love certain artists for a reason. I love <strong>Fred Moore</strong>, the Disney artist whose recreation of Mickey Mouse really changed the game. Went from a little mouse with two dots for eyes that made tooting sounds, to this beautiful little fluid mouse we know today. That was Fred Moore, changed it on the fly.</p>

<p>And he risked the wrath of Walt Disney, but it shows you what a great leader Walt Disney was despite any fallibilities he might have had beyond that. He was willing to say <strong>this is how Mickey Mouse should be drawn from now on</strong>.</p>

<p>So <strong>be fearless</strong>. If it doesn't look right, change it. See what else is there. Try and make it <strong>better</strong>. And I don't mean correct, I mean just better, <strong>aesthetically</strong>. Anything can be corrected.</p>

<h3>Experimenting with Expressions</h3>

<p>See how I'm changing those <strong>eyebrows</strong>? The higher the eyebrow, the more <strong>youth</strong>. But also do them too high for, let's say, a much older duchess, for instance, that's trying to look young, and they draw their eyebrows way too high, they overcompensate. That can look great on a character. Think of <strong>Cruella de Vil</strong>, and characters like that.</p>

<p>So <strong>exploring how people behave</strong> will create great characters too. You've got to really go out and <strong>observe people</strong>. And see how many characters there are. There are so many. Even go to a supermarket, you don't have to go down to a village or anything, you know, and find really extreme characters. <strong>They're everywhere</strong>.</p>

<p>I often say to my students, they say to me, <strong>how do I create characters? ** I say, ** they're all in this room. Every single one. And that's when they do their </strong>blind contour**, and they realize that everyone has their own little characteristics. There'll be a super tall "I don't know how to draw that character," and there's a six and a half foot skinny kid standing there, and then there's a five-foot tall chubbier kid there as well. You know, they are everywhere.</p>

<p><strong>Characters are all over the place</strong>. So draw them all and see what we get. That's a wonderful class. We do that blind contour. We get so many characters by lunchtime. It's incredible, really. I say, now there you go. There's a page full of characters. <strong>Go explore</strong>. Go and put a pirate hat on one and see what comes to that. Before you know it, they're drawing eye patches.</p>

<h2>Addressing Challenging Areas</h2>

<p>Alright, so there we go with her. Nice big <strong>rectus femoris</strong> there. Legs getting a bit tube-like. Pushing down for the <strong>patella</strong> and adding a little bit more for that <strong>boxy knee</strong>. Really becomes a hell of a box at that point. When those <strong>condyles</strong> separate from each other, that's really a huge, big, almost giraffe-like knee. Incredible stuff.</p>

<p>There's the <strong>tarsal ramp</strong> there. So <strong>knees</strong> are, I wouldn't say they're a problem, but they're definitely a <strong>challenge</strong>. I've got a lot of movies on my web store about legs particularly, just to address the knees really.</p>

<p>They can do amazing things, the legs, and they give us great opportunity for <strong>structure and gesture</strong> around those knee areas. The knees might be something you've avoided all this time because every knee looks different. You might go, <strong>is there any method to this at all?</strong> And there's plenty of method.</p>

<p>We'll explore it over and over. I mean, there's a method there. You come down <strong>four quadriceps</strong> as a curve and then just follow it right away with the tendon and the kneecap and then again with the bone of the <strong>tibia</strong> all coming in at an angle. A big thick line, a smaller thick line, and a long diagonal straight line. <strong>Wow! A knee!</strong> A knee that rings true.</p>

<h2>Understanding Mass and Focus</h2>

<p>And remember <strong>mass</strong> and the <strong>power of mass</strong>. And with all that grey stuff down on the leg, we tend not to look. If you want someone to look somewhere, like I'm saying look up here at this face, there's more detail and <strong>contrast</strong> up there.</p>

<p>So I'm re-establishing <strong>bone landmarks</strong>, all landmarks actually. So thinking about what's under the deltoid? The <strong>humerus bone</strong> is under there, the big <strong>condyle</strong> of it. So that big ball will create a highlight, and I'll push it in there.</p>

<p>As the arm goes back, that humerus ball pushes forward, and so the highlight now is around the front. And if the arm comes down by its side, that highlight would start to look like it is more on the side. Imagine a sphere, a snooker ball, just turning this light to see what's happening.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p>So there's another example of just <strong>sharpening the pencil</strong>, and as I sharpen the pencil, it gives you a chance to just <strong>frame that picture</strong> with very little effort. Let's say the frame wasn't there. People go, oh there's a drawing, and then they see the frame, and they go <strong>wow, that's a big finished piece because you framed it</strong>.</p>

<p>It gives you a chance to sharpen the pencil, and remember I'm <strong>turning that pencil in between strokes</strong> every once in a while to make sure I'm sharpening it from every angle. So look where the type was there on the pencil, and after a while, you'll start to see on my drawings that that type will move around. Think of it <strong>orbiting</strong>, I'm doing it there actually, moving that pencil around in between strokes to sharpen it all the way round.</p>

<p>So that's one of those subliminal things you may not be aware of. There you go. It's a different angle now. So you always <strong>sharpen your pencil as you draw</strong>. On the page, then you don't have to go off and sharpen a pencil that has worn down on one side.</p>

<p>It's all over <strong>incremental</strong>, making you the <strong>best pencil you can possibly draw with</strong>.</p>

<p>I like that drawing. It's got a little heavy in parts. That's the great thing about it. You can look at that drawing that's just been done and say to yourself, a little heavy there on the <strong>rectus femoris</strong>. Let's see if you can <strong>lighten up for this one</strong>.</p>

<p>And with the <strong>mileage</strong> based on that drawing, you can say I can do this drawing now that's coming out with a lighter hand, a lighter touch. So always <strong>lighten up for the next drawing</strong> because you've still inherited the heavier hand from, like, say, detail or render from the previous drawing. Lighten up. New drawing. A lighter hand is required.</p>

<p>So I'm thinking here of <strong>balance</strong>, a pose.</p>

<h2>Observations from Teaching</h2>

<p>At the university I taught here in Brisbane, <strong>QUT</strong>, they have a whole building with <strong>ballerinas</strong> in it, and I would take my students down there to draw the ballerinas, and they loved it. A lot of that stuff is like what we're doing here but not as interesting. They're <strong>rinsing and repeating</strong> all the time.</p>

<p>To be a great ballerina, they have to be constantly doing the same move a thousand times to get it fluid, and so when we come in as artists, they're really keen to show it off.</p>

<p>I remember one ballerina, I said, would you mind doing a few jumps? And she couldn't believe how great that idea was because now she finally got to show people what she can do, and everyone benefited from it. Really wonderful drawings from that student. A great student she was, obviously, because she was the only person there, staying behind to get better and better.</p>

<p>I'll never forget that day because we did so many drawings. You know, every drawing you do feeds in. You can <strong>dig it up later</strong>. And I learned a lot about <strong>balance</strong> that day. Especially about this little pushing of the legs and the pointing of the toes that they do so much. And it showed me new kinds of balance.</p>

<p>The ordinary person doesn't balance on their toe. It changed the dynamics of what we were drawing. And it made me realize just how much they move their arms around for balance, almost like <strong>tightrope walkers</strong> because they're walking a finer line than most people.</p>

<p>So their arms are almost like the pole of a tightrope walker because they need it. They're always in motion. We're rarely in that much motion that we need to push our arms all the way out like this. But look at the fluidity of it. It's great.</p>

<p>And with the tools we have, we could adapt to those <strong>extreme poses</strong>. Because we have the <strong>sternocleidomastoid</strong> always ready to go, the arch coming in toward the abdominals, all that stuff was there for us to use when we were drawing movement.</p>

<p>I think there's a <strong>Glen Keane</strong> demo of him drawing ballerinas somewhere on YouTube. See if you can find that. One of the great Disney artists.</p>

<h2>Pushing the Limits</h2>

<p>So here I go again with that same light hand and using the <strong>tube</strong> to push way, way, way back in. So <strong>Mrs. V</strong> now is quite squashed out. And that's telling me that the hips are going way back. And that's an amazing pose.</p>

<p>So I remember <strong>John Buscema</strong> would draw the <strong>Wasp</strong>, the Wasp woman. And she was always flying around like that. And it was tough to draw that kind of thing because we don't see many people do it. But once you learn the little basics, you can do it.</p>

<h3>Adjusting Details</h3>

<p>So there's the head going back. That <strong>ear's too high</strong>. So I'm going to have to adjust that ear back down again. There you go. So <strong>head up, ear down</strong>. So don't make that mistake.</p>

<p>Even though the ear equates with the eyebrow and the nose in a straight-ahead figure like you see on the middle pose there. That head's actually tilted down a little bit, so the ear's up a little bit.</p>

<p>Remember, that's the idea. It's only for a straight-ahead pose that you can see the ear is the length of the nose, and equates eyebrow to there. And even that's not entirely true for everyone, it's just a ballpark.</p>

<h3>Understanding Movement</h3>

<p>So we're pushing the chest forward, meaning the rib cage, and so the <strong>breasts</strong> are being pushed forward, and they are squashed a little bit for that reason, and also reshaped by the arms going up. Always moving, being compressed by the rib cage, being pulled by gravity, being squashed against a surface, anything at all. The breasts are always changing with the pose.</p>

<p>Try an <strong>upside-down pose</strong> with a character hanging from somewhere and watch those breasts do something opposite of what we're used to, which is falling down toward the head. <strong>Madness, but a wonderful challenge</strong>.</p>
