<p>Welcome to this journey of painting without overthinking. Unlearning hindering habits is crucial for artistic growth. By breaking down the painting process into manageable stages, you can focus on each aspect without feeling overwhelmed. This methodical approach makes it easier to follow along and understand how everything links together in the end.</p>

<h2>Planning and Developing Values</h2>

<p>Begin by blocking in the head and progressively working into the darks with your values. Mix a <strong>dark halftone</strong> using a bit of black and alizarin crimson to keep it warm. Apply this to areas like the hairline, beard growth, and shadows under the eyes and chin. Pay attention to the variations in value caused by light falling on different planes of the face.</p>

<h2>The Four Types of Edges</h2>

<p>Understanding edges is crucial in conveying form and depth in your portraits. There are <strong>four kinds of edges</strong> to utilize:</p>

<ol>

<li>

<p><strong>Hard Edges</strong>: Typically found in cast shadows, such as under the nose or where the head casts a shadow on the neck. These edges are sharp and clearly define the separation between light and dark.</p>

</li>

<li>

<p><strong>Firm Edges</strong>: Less sharp than hard edges but still well-defined. They often occur where two forms meet, like the transition between bone structures and flesh.</p>

</li>

<li>

<p><strong>Soft Edges</strong>: Indicate rounded forms by gently transitioning between light and dark. Use soft edges for areas like the cheeks or the bulbous tip of the nose.</p>

</li>

<li>

<p><strong>Lost Edges</strong>: Occur when adjacent areas share similar values, causing edges to disappear into the background. Lost edges create a sense of mystery and rest for the eye, as seen when hair blends seamlessly into a dark background.</p>

</li>

</ol>

<h3>Applying Edges to Convey Form</h3>

<p>Edges aren't just about transitions, they tell a story about the form. Varying edges, hard, firm, soft, and lost, adds musicality to your painting. For example, a hard edge can emphasize the structure of a bone, while a soft edge can suggest the roundness of a cheek.</p>

<h2>Using Your Finger as a Tool</h2>

<p>Sometimes, your finger is the best tool for softening edges. Gently blend areas with a single, confident swipe to avoid muddying colors. Wipe your finger clean between strokes. This technique is especially effective for creating <strong>soft</strong> and <strong>lost edges</strong>, contributing to the painting's overall realism.</p>

<p>After blending, re-establish important details with your brush. This interplay between softening and redefining enhances the depth and vitality of your portrait.</p>

<h2>Enhancing with Color Variations</h2>

<p>While the initial stages may appear monochromatic, introducing subtle color variations will bring your painting to life. Add warmth to areas like the lips or creases around the eyes. These small touches of color contribute to the humanity and lifelike appearance of your subject.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p>By understanding and skillfully applying the concept of edges, you can significantly improve the realism and depth of your portraits. Observe your reference closely, use edges to convey form, and refine your work as you progress. With practice, these techniques will become second nature, and you'll find that painting isn't as hard as you thought.</p>
