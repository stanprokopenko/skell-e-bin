<h2>What's in Premium?</h2>

<p>In the full lesson, we break down the fundamentals of gesture drawing into three key components: understanding <strong>why</strong> we draw gestures, determining <strong>what</strong> we're drawing, and deciding <strong>how</strong> to achieve the desired look. We'll explore the importance of abstraction in conveying ideas, using simple lines and shapes like curves, straights, and basic forms to express complex concepts. You'll learn how elements like the <strong>line of beauty</strong> and rhythm enhance your drawings, and how shapes influence character perception in design. We'll also dive into capturing non-verbal communication and body language to tell a story through your figures. By understanding these concepts, you'll develop a personal and effective approach to gesture drawing.</p>
