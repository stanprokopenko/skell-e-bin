<h2>Matter and Energy</h2>

<p>I always think of <strong>structure</strong> as the solid, three-dimensional form, like the architecture of whatever I'm drawing. I pair that with <strong>gesture</strong>, which is the fluid, lifelike energy flowing through everything. I call it the <strong>matter and energy</strong> of art. It's a balance of corners and curves, form and fluidity. This resonates with how our universe is built, matter plus energy. When I respect both in my drawing, I get the solidity of life and the flowing grace of life.</p>

<h2>Why Connection Matters</h2>

<p>Art’s superpower is its ability to connect ideas. For example:<br />

- <strong>Foreground</strong> can connect to <strong>background</strong> through linear perspective.<br />

- <strong>Light</strong> and <strong>shadow</strong> connect through gradual changes in value.  </p>

<p>These strategies help me convey depth and unity. No matter how complex something is, I can find ways to connect the big shapes with subtle transitions.</p>

<h2>Simple Shapes and Curves</h2>

<p>To make drawing more approachable, I distill it to a few childlike ideas. I often start with <strong>simple geometric shapes</strong>, such as boxes, tubes, eggs, or teardrops, to represent an arm, a torso, or any object. Then I add <strong>gesture</strong> by curving the <strong>long axis</strong> of those shapes. I connect structure and gesture early, so the drawing has both solidity and movement.</p>

<p>When I first draw a part of the body, I replace it with a basic three-dimensional form and then give that form a <strong>curve</strong> that suggests how it moves. Having both shape (for structure) and curve (for gesture) keeps it lively and believable.</p>

<h2>Seeing Like an Artist</h2>

<p>Reality can look incredibly complex. I’m not born with the ability to see the underlying shapes and curves, it’s something I wire into my brain through practice. Anyone can learn this. It’s the same idea as learning a sport or a musical instrument. Consistent exposure and effort help me see the world in simpler terms, and I can draw it with clarity.</p>

<h2>Building Value</h2>

<p>Once I have my structure and gesture in place, I can start playing with <strong>value</strong>, light and shadow. I like to keep it simple by making shadow shapes darker, and light-side shapes lighter. I’m not worrying about every law of light right away. Just blocking in <strong>shadow shapes</strong> and <strong>light shapes</strong> gives me a strong illusion of form. Later, I might refine those transitions or add half-tones and subtle gradations. But I don’t need all that complexity at the start.</p>

<h2>Putting It All Together</h2>

<p>My process is about layering <strong>simple ideas</strong>: 

1. Draw a <strong>gesture</strong> line or curve along the long axis.<br />

2. Add <strong>structure</strong> using basic forms (two-dimensional or three-dimensional).<br />

3. Block in the <strong>shadows</strong> and <strong>lights</strong> with simple value shapes.  </p>

<p>When my structural forms feel solid, and my gestures feel fluid, the drawing starts to look alive. From there, I can refine details, push realism, or stylize my work. It all begins with <strong>connecting gesture and structure</strong>. That’s the foundation I build on each time I draw.</p>
