<h2>Navigating Imaginary Space</h2>

<p>You're traveling into imaginary space, the same three dimensions you've known since you were born. A wondrous illusion is created by the placement and combination of only three lines. We'll call them <strong>X, Y, and Z</strong>.</p>

<p>Perspective lines take you into imaginary space. Before you learn to navigate and measure in there, you need to know the <strong>three guiding lines</strong>. They're called <strong>axes</strong>, which is the plural for axis. An axis is just a line, usually one you can't actually see. An imaginary line can help you <strong>foreshorten</strong>, the <strong>long axis</strong> shortens when it points toward you.</p>

<h2>The Importance of Axes</h2>

<p>Pretty much every object has a long axis, unless it doesn't. So, we need a system that works for all forms, including environments. These can get complicated. Here's one way to solve it, rather than start with a whole scene, you can start with <strong>placement lines</strong>. Placement lines give a base from which to jump.</p>

<p>You can imagine <strong>three sets of lines</strong>, and those three line systems position the whole scene. <strong>Three line directions</strong> let you find other lines.</p>

<h2>From Flat Angles to Space</h2>

<p>Let's see where we are. You've learned about angles and protractors. That was the flat surface out of perspective. You put a good deal of work into getting an eye for those angles, but that was only a start. It wasn't yet <strong>space</strong>.</p>

<p>Then orthos, orthographics, say this flat surface means something more, a thing that is not flat. But now you move into the really hard views that slant into space. Prepare yourself here, <strong>three-quarter views, oblique views, tipped, tilted, slant, at an angle</strong>. That changes everything. How could you ever predict it?</p>

<p>Here's an idea: tilt it back behind a window, look at the window, and measure the angles on the window with a protractor. That is how perspective works. You could take the time to label those angles, but would you? If you do, it names angles, but it wouldn't help much with learning to draw besides noticing angles and labeling them. Not enough. You could get old doing that and not learn how to draw in perspective.</p>

<h2>The Simplest and Most Useful Angle</h2>

<p>You're about to learn something simpler and more useful, the simplest and most useful angle of all, the <strong>right angle</strong>.</p>

<p>Two lines, oh, I'm sorry, <strong>three lines</strong>, one I forgot. Right here where the two lines meet. Can you guess it? If you're thinking a 45-degree angle comes out of there, you're learning the protractor. Good. But that's not a right angle, and that's not where we're going.</p>

<p>There's another right angle facing toward you. You're looking right at it. It's pointing at you. Let me show you. It's a right angle to vertical if you look at it from one direction, and it's a right angle to horizontal if you look at it from another. This is how you <strong>coordinate space</strong>.</p>

<h2>The Three-Dimensional Compass: X, Y, Z</h2>

<p>This three-dimensional compass of <strong>X, Y, Z</strong> arranges the three poles of space, each at right angles to both of the others. Let's think about that. A compass rose shows north and south, up and down on the map. It shows east and west, right and left on the map. But it doesn't show a third dimension unless you give it an axis that is upward, not northward.</p>

<p>With <strong>three axes</strong> in an oblique view, you have the most simplified arrangement possible to navigate space.</p>

<h3>Naming the Axes</h3>

<p>Why do we use letters? You could say up and down, left and right, close and far. But spin this, and what was up is now left. What was left is now far. So, you can't always name a line by its position or where it points because that may change.</p>

<p><strong>X, Y, Z</strong> lets you place objects so that even in different positions, their names stay the same, and it still makes sense if they spin or tumble.</p>

<h2>Navigating Complex Objects and Environments</h2>

<p>How about environments? They don't spin into different positions. Ah, but <strong>we do</strong>. In environments, you use letters for axes in case your <strong>viewpoint changes</strong>. But you can call the axes anything, as long as they don't get confused with their directions on the surface. This is not about the surface, this is about the <strong>world in there</strong>. If you move around in that world, every angle on the surface changes. How can you keep track?</p>

<p>Remember that a setting, like a form, has its own set of axes. Sometimes axes have <strong>vanishing points</strong>, sometimes not. Sometimes the vanishing points are close, sometimes distant. The thing that stays constant is the name of each set of lines from the orthos.</p>

<p>(By the way, some systems swap out the Y and the Z.) No biggie, different names, same thing.)</p>

<h2>Reviewing the Axes</h2>

<p>Let's review the names that we'll use:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>X</strong> is the <strong>width</strong> of the object, not its direction on the paper.</li>

<li><strong>Y</strong> is the <strong>height</strong> of the object, as you named it in the ortho.</li>

<li><strong>X and Y</strong> represent width and height of an object.</li>

</ul>

<p>X and Y could still be flat dimensions if they are flat designs, but <strong>Z</strong> requires you to acknowledge <strong>depth</strong> and usually introduces a <strong>vanishing point</strong>. But your concern here is only that <strong>three sets of parallel lines</strong> cover all three dimensions. Those are the <strong>axes</strong>. They will apply to very complex objects as you advance.</p>

<h2>Assigning Axes to Lines</h2>

<p>Let's prepare with a literal assignment. Your assignment is simple. You literally assign one of three letters, <strong>X, Y, or Z</strong> (or any system you're used to), to each set of lines in these images.</p>

<p>Then <strong>sketch</strong> from each image. Sketch the object, sketch the scene. Don't get fussy. Doing several a little loosely is better than doing only one very precisely.</p>

<p>Find the <strong>three line systems</strong>, label them to recognize which line system each line belongs to. Naming these lines should be easy. Everything here is lined up. This is the <strong>easiest level</strong>. You may get through it fast.</p>

<h3>Level 1: Aligned Objects</h3>

<p>In the first level, things are lined up. Assign X, Y, and Z to each set of parallel lines. This should be straightforward.</p>

<h3>Level 2: Non-Aligned Objects</h3>

<p>Here's the next level. Here, things are <strong>not lined up</strong>. That means that this could be X or Z. You can decide which is width, which is depth. The important thing is that once you decide, <strong>stay consistent</strong> as you work through the object to rehearse your awareness.</p>

<p>Remember, the letters you choose don't change their names when an object changes position. <strong>Y does not turn into X when it lies horizontal</strong>. You label per object so that when objects tumble, you know which direction is which.</p>

<h3>Level 3: Bevels and Diagonals</h3>

<p>If this still seems too easy, try the next level. It includes <strong>bevels</strong>, <strong>diagonal lines</strong>. That means they move on <strong>two axes</strong>. Scary? Perhaps that some of these lines move in two directions at once? But you can deal with it.</p>

<p>You label them not as belonging exclusively to one of these three directions. You name <strong>two axes</strong> on which the lines move:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>XZ</strong>: that's width and depth.</li>

<li><strong>ZY</strong>: that's depth and height.</li>

<li><strong>XY</strong>: that's width and height.</li>

</ul>

<p>If you are cutting these boxes, you move the cutting blade out and back, or up and back, or in and up, <strong>two axes combined</strong>, <strong>two letters assigned</strong>.</p>

<h3>The Challenge of Multi-Axis Lines</h3>

<p>If you want the hardest of all, try lines that move on <strong>all three axes</strong>. Say out loud the directions in which each line moves. This lets you know that more than three axes exist.</p>

<p>So why only three letters? If you want more, here's where to find them: <strong>spherical coordinates</strong> - axes that could melt your brain. This simple labeling gets your brain ready to handle that heat.</p>

<h2>The Secret of Primary Axes</h2>

<p>The secret is not to learn all of those lines in between. It's to learn <strong>primary lines</strong>, which give you the lines in between. It's something like color. <strong>Three primary colors</strong> yield lots of others. Three primary axes give you enough to deduce the spatial structure of the globe.</p>

<p>Notice the primary lines, <strong>three to begin</strong>. This will expand your awareness of spatial dimensions, X, Y, and Z, and the parts in between.</p>

<p>You can study many lines, or you can study three. <strong>Everything spatial is XYZ</strong>.</p>

<h2>Assignment: Label and Sketch</h2>

<p>Okay, <strong>label and sketch</strong>.</p>
