<h2>Establishing the Side Plane of the Head</h2>

<p>The side plane is a crucial element in face construction. To establish it:</p>

<ol>

<li>Identify four key points: hairline, base of the nose, temple, and back of the skull.</li>

<li>Draw the hairline as the planar break between forehead and top of head.</li>

<li>Wrap the line to the back of the head.</li>

<li>Use these points to create the side plane cut.</li>

</ol>

<p>Once you have the side plane, you can establish the ear, jaw, and cheek positions. Remember that the basic principle is <strong>shaving down big forms</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Tip:</strong> The side plane helps define the perspective of the head. A wider ellipse indicates a more frontal view, while a narrower one suggests more rotation.</p>

<h2>Developing the Eye Sockets</h2>

<p>Start with the simplest version of the eye sockets, then progress to more complex shapes:</p>

<ol>

<li>Begin with the "Cyclops" plane: a single cut-back plane for both sockets.</li>

<li>Mark the brow line and bottom of the sockets.</li>

<li>Draw two lines dropping back from these points to create the socket plane.</li>

</ol>

<p>To add complexity:</p>

<ol>

<li>Divide the forehead into three planes.</li>

<li>Create the keystone area between the brows.</li>

<li>Add organic curves to represent the rounded socket shape.</li>

</ol>

<p><strong>Remember:</strong> The eye socket structure is crucial for correct eye placement and lighting effects.</p>

<h2>Building the Nose Structure</h2>

<p>Construct the nose using these steps:</p>

<ol>

<li>Start from the end of the keystone.</li>

<li>Mark the width of the nose at its base.</li>

<li>Identify the tip of the nose (where highlights typically appear).</li>

<li>Connect these points to create the basic nose shape.</li>

</ol>

<p><strong>Tip:</strong> Begin with a simplified, single-plane representation of the nose bridge, then add complexity as needed.</p>

<h2>Creating the Denture Sphere</h2>

<p>The denture sphere represents the mouth area:</p>

<ol>

<li>Draw a light egg shape extending from the chin to about the midline of the eyes.</li>

<li>Use this shape to guide the placement of the mouth and surrounding features.</li>

<li>Remember that the mouth is rounded to accommodate eating.</li>

</ol>

<p><strong>Important:</strong> The denture sphere helps organize features like the nasolabial furrow and cheek structure.</p>

<h2>Gradual Complexity Approach</h2>

<p>The key to successful face construction is starting simple and gradually adding complexity:</p>

<ol>

<li>Begin with idealized, generic forms.</li>

<li>Slowly incorporate more specific details based on observation.</li>

<li>Allow room for adjustments and refinements throughout the process.</li>

</ol>

<h2>Perspective and Form in Face Construction</h2>

<p>Think of the face in terms of <strong>3D forms and planes</strong>:</p>

<ul>

<li>Use simple shapes like spheres and cylinders as the foundation.</li>

<li>Apply perspective principles to all facial features.</li>

<li>Consider how planes change direction across the face.</li>

</ul>

<p>When drawing different angles:</p>

<ol>

<li>Adjust the width of ellipses to indicate head rotation.</li>

<li>Maintain consistent proportions and structure across various views.</li>

<li>Use foreshortening techniques for features turning away from view.</li>

</ol>

<p><strong>Remember:</strong> Every line you draw should reinforce the 3D form of the face. Think of your drawing as sculpting with lines rather than creating flat shapes.</p>

<p>By following these steps and principles, you'll create a solid foundation for portrait drawing that allows for both accuracy and artistic interpretation.</p>
