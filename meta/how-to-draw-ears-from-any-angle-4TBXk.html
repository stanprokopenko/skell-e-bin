<p>Welcome to the ear chapter. In this lesson, we'll break down the anatomy of the ear and its basic structure. We'll start with a quick overview of the ear's anatomy, then move on to construction sketches from different perspectives using some fantastic references from Bodies in Motion. We'll study the ear from the front, back, and profile views, and I'll share tips and advice along the way.</p>

<h2>Basic Ear Anatomy</h2>

<h3>Placement and Proportions</h3>

<p>We're going to start off by using the <strong>Loomis method</strong>. I begin with a simple light sphere to represent the volume of the cranium. I cut it in half horizontally and vertically. The <strong>horizontal line</strong> represents the <strong>brow line</strong>, which also indicates <strong>where the top of the ear will be</strong>.</p>

<p>Then, I block in the gesture of the face mask and the jaw, pulling it forward slightly. I also add the gesture of the neck, which leans forward and flows down into the upper back.</p>

<p>I find the <strong>base of the ear</strong>, which aligns with the <strong>base of the nose</strong>. These are part of the classical canons for the figure, but remember, there are many variations. Some people have ears that line up differently, but for now, we'll stick with this canon.</p>

<p>Once I place the ear, it gives me a nice guide for finding the edge of the cheekbone. I follow from the top of the ear and pull it down towards the base of the chin. This adds dimension and structure to the profile.</p>

<p>Behind the ear, we have the <strong>mastoid process</strong>, where the <strong>sternocleidomastoid</strong> muscle attaches.</p>

<p>At this point, we've established the average positioning of the ear. It definitely favors the backside of the skull. Typically, the front side is closer to two-thirds, and the back side is more like one-third of the width of the profile of the head.</p>

<p>Remember, the <strong>top of the ear lines up with the brow line</strong>, and the <strong>base of the earlobe lines up with the base of the nose</strong>. These are very important points to remember when placing the ear.</p>

<h2>Simplifying the Ear</h2>

<h3>Steps for Blocking In the Ear</h3>

<p>Now that we have the basic gesture in place, let's dive in and break down the anatomy of the ear. One of the initial steps for blocking in the inner shapes of the ear is to start with a <strong>hook shape</strong>. This is your <strong>step one</strong>.</p>

<p>For <strong>step two</strong>, have an <strong>interlocking hook</strong> that comes up and around and feeds into the other hook at the bottom. Think of this as the stem or root of the hook.</p>

<p>With these two main shapes, you can block in the rest of the smaller shapes. I use a combination of <strong>straights and curves</strong> to give it some nice structure and sense of being solid.</p>

<p>I like to think of the ear's overall gesture as resembling a <strong>bass clef symbol</strong>. This gives me a starting point to build off of.</p>

<h3>Important Landmarks</h3>

<p>The ear is located behind the jawbone, on the back three-quarter of the head. As I mentioned before, the <strong>top of the ear lines up with the brow line</strong>, and the <strong>base of the earlobe lines up with the base of the nose</strong>. It's crucial to remember these alignments for accurate proportions.</p>

<p>To recap the steps:</p>

<ol>

<li>Start with the <strong>outer hook shape</strong> representing the <strong>helix</strong>.</li>

<li>Add the <strong>interlocking inner hook</strong>, which feeds into the base of the first hook.</li>

<li>Include a <strong>smaller, reversed hook shape</strong> that almost forms a <strong>G</strong>. This frames the <strong>ear canal</strong>.</li>

</ol>

<h2>The Names of the Ear Parts</h2>

<p>Let's break down the anatomical parts of the ear:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Helix</strong>: This is the entire outer portion of the ear.</li>

<li><strong>Antihelix</strong>: The inner shape framed by the helix.</li>

<li><strong>Tragus</strong>: A small protrusion facing forward, near the ear canal.</li>

<li><strong>Antitragus</strong>: Opposite the tragus, facing it.</li>

<li><strong>Triangular fossa</strong>: A small triangular depression often in shadow.</li>

<li><strong>Concha</strong>: The inner part near the ear canal, forming a bowl-like shape that funnels sound into the ear.</li>

<li><strong>Earlobe</strong>: The soft lower part of the ear.</li>

</ul>

<p>These names are fairly easy to memorize because they come in pairs: <strong>helix and antihelix</strong>, <strong>tragus and antitragus</strong>.</p>

<h2>Drawing the Ear from Different Angles</h2>

<p>I highly recommend doing quick gestural studies from different perspectives to get better at drawing ears. Using high-resolution 3D scans from Bodies in Motion, we'll study the ear from the front, back, and profile views.</p>

<h3>Front View</h3>

<p>Starting with the front view, I begin by adding a straight line to indicate the side of the face where the ear attaches. I add the <strong>brow line</strong> to know where the top of the ear will be.</p>

<p>I start the <strong>helix</strong> of the ear, pulling it down in that <strong>bass clef shape</strong>. I give it some thickness as it comes down to the <strong>earlobe</strong>.</p>

<p>I break up the shape into <strong>straights and curves</strong> for structure. I block in the <strong>antihelix</strong> and the <strong>triangular fossa</strong>. The helix swoops down and goes behind the <strong>tragus</strong>, which faces off with the <strong>antitragus</strong>.</p>

<p>The <strong>concha</strong> is the inner part near the ear canal, forming a bucket shape that catches sound waves.</p>

<p>Remember, the <strong>top of the ear lines up with the brow line</strong>, and the <strong>base of the earlobe lines up with the base of the nose</strong>.</p>

<h3>Back View</h3>

<p>For the back view, the ear is simpler yet still complex due to subtle plane changes. I start with a <strong>flattened, elongated S-curve</strong> for the ear's gesture.</p>

<p>The <strong>helix</strong> is thicker at the top and tapers down as it moves towards the base, then thickens again towards the <strong>earlobe</strong>.</p>

<p>The <strong>concha</strong> is visible from the back and has a bucket-like shape that fans out away from the head.</p>

<p>Behind the ear, we have the <strong>mastoid process</strong>, where the <strong>sternocleidomastoid</strong> muscle attaches.</p>

<h3>Profile View</h3>

<p>In the profile view, I start with the <strong>bass clef shape</strong> for the overall flow of the ear. The <strong>helix</strong> forms the outermost part, and I give it thickness.</p>

<p>I add the <strong>antihelix</strong>, which shows the internal structure, and indicate the <strong>triangular fossa</strong>.</p>

<p>The <strong>tragus</strong> is a small nub that overlaps the base of the <strong>helix</strong>. Opposite the tragus is the <strong>antitragus</strong>.</p>

<p>The <strong>concha</strong> funnels into the <strong>ear canal</strong>, usually located behind or underneath the tragus.</p>

<p>Again, it's important to remember that the <strong>top of the ear lines up with the brow line</strong>, and the <strong>base of the earlobe lines up with the base of the nose</strong>.</p>

<p>Throughout this lesson, we've explored the anatomy of the ear and how to draw it from different angles. Remember the key proportions and placements, and practice with quick gestural studies to internalize these concepts. Repetition truly is the mother of all skill. Keep practicing, and you'll master drawing the ear's complex structures in no time.</p>
