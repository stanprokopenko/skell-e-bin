<h2>Studying My Son's Features</h2>

<p>When thinking about my next illustration, I knew I wanted to incorporate <strong>AC units</strong> to decorate the background. But that wasn't too challenging to research. The real question was, <strong>what would be the focal point?</strong> What elements could I explore that would be both interesting and meaningful?</p>

<p>I started looking at photos of my son, who was around nine months old at the time. He's now 13 months, but those earlier pictures captured some truly adorable shapes. <strong>His head turns and cheek shapes</strong> are some of the most delightful forms I've ever seen. I realized I hadn't spent much time drawing him because of other commitments. So, I decided to take this opportunity to <strong>draw some fan art of my son</strong>.</p>

<h2>Observing Ratios in Baby Faces</h2>

<p>The unique aspect of his face is, as I mentioned, the shape of his cheeks. I've drawn enough chibi characters to generally know what a small, young person looks like, but in reality, it's a bit different and even cuter.</p>

<p>In this photo, Conan was just getting over a cold, so there are little splashes under his nose. Focusing on the <strong>ratios</strong> of his face, I noticed that the <strong>eye line is almost the midpoint</strong> of his face. This is because the face is smaller on a younger person. Observing further, there's an indent at the forehead, and the distance from there to the chin is slightly longer.</p>

<p>I measured with my hands, a technique I learned from observational drawing where you <strong>measure exactly to understand proportions</strong>. I found that there's a one-to-one ratio between the forehead and the cheeks before it hits the chin shape. The cheeks protrude, creating mirrored bulges on either side.</p>

<h3>Breaking Down the Features</h3>

<ul>

<li><strong>Head Shape</strong>: Almost a square when considering the width and length, but with rounded edges.</li>

<li><strong>Eye Line</strong>: Right through the middle of the face.</li>

<li><strong>Eyebrows</strong>: I like to draw them to define the front plane of the face, much like drawing a box.</li>

<li><strong>Ears</strong>: Define the side plane of the face and are aligned with the side.</li>

<li><strong>Eyes and Nose</strong>: The width of the eye is similar to the width of the nose.</li>

<li><strong>Mouth</strong>: Really small and cute, with a little dip and a slight protrusion of the lip.</li>

<li><strong>Hairline</strong>: Follows different planes, aligning with the top and side planes of the head.</li>

<li><strong>Jawline</strong>: Starts right by the ear.</li>

</ul>

<p>By observing and being aware of these details, I organically <strong>learn and internalize anatomy</strong>.</p>

<h2>Studying the Unique Hat</h2>

<p>One idea I had was to use a hat he was wearing once. He hated it, but it was so funny! I wanted to study it a bit.</p>

<h3>Analyzing the Hat's Shapes</h3>

<ul>

<li><strong>Head Shape</strong>: The hat follows the same shape as his head but is slightly thicker.</li>

<li><strong>Thickness</strong>: Exaggerated thickness going all the way around.</li>

<li><strong>Top Cone</strong>: A small bump at the top, rounded off based on the lighting.</li>

<li><strong>Ears</strong>: Bisected by the detail inside, resembling a super rounded-off cylinder, connecting towards the back of the head.</li>

<li><strong>Connection</strong>: The hat connects in the front with a button, about the width of the full strap.</li>

</ul>

<p>By spending time <strong>breaking down the shapes</strong>, I gained a basic understanding of the hat's design.</p>

<h2>Applying the Design to New Contexts</h2>

<p>Now that I've studied the hat, I can think about applying it in different ways. For instance, I could:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Draw it from different angles</strong>, like from above with the cute little hill at the back.</li>

<li><strong>Use it on a different character</strong>, not necessarily my son.</li>

<li><strong>Place it on an animal</strong> or create a new character.</li>

<li><strong>Transform it into something else</strong>, like the silliest airplane you've ever seen!</li>

</ul>

<h3>Experimenting with the Hat Design</h3>

<p>For fun, I decided to turn the hat into a ship:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Flapping Ears</strong>: Imagine the ears flapping up and down.</li>

<li><strong>Front Window</strong>: The front of the vehicle could be a window.</li>

<li><strong>Incorporate Previous Studies</strong>: Borrow elements from other studies, like a vehicle with a wheel.</li>

<li><strong>Strapping It Together</strong>: Use the button and straps as functional design elements.</li>

</ul>

<p>This playful approach allows me to <strong>experiment and combine shapes</strong> I've studied, making it easier and more enjoyable.</p>

<h2>Creating Characters Inspired by Studies</h2>

<p>I often like to <strong>put unique designs onto characters</strong>, sometimes even on very different ones, like a sexy girl wearing a cute baby hat. Since I understand the shape, I can do different poses and have fun with it.</p>

<h3>Designing the Character</h3>

<ul>

<li><strong>Head Shape</strong>: Use the rounded box shape of the hat.</li>

<li><strong>Hill Shape</strong>: Incorporate the little hill at the top.</li>

<li><strong>Adult Character</strong>: Place an adult character inside, not just a cute baby.</li>

<li><strong>Juxtaposition</strong>: Create a gritty story where the only thing that doesn't make sense is the cute hat.</li>

</ul>

<p>By playing with the design in unexpected ways, I aim to <strong>evoke reactions</strong> from others, whether it's humor, surprise, or intrigue.</p>

<h3>Connecting Design Elements</h3>

<ul>

<li><strong>Repeated Motifs</strong>: Use the cute strap from the hat as a motif throughout the design.</li>

<li><strong>Weaponizing Features</strong>: Turn the ears into weapons sticking out.</li>

<li><strong>Incorporate Details</strong>: Include ridges and other small features for added interest.</li>

</ul>

<p>This process is similar to my work on <strong>"Sea of Stars"</strong>. The game director loved everything I did, which was a dream scenario. The more I had fun and did silly or unexpected things, the more he liked it.</p>

<h2>Incorporating Story into Design</h2>

<p>When I'm <strong>having fun and playing with designs</strong>, the story elements come more naturally. As I draw and explore, I begin to imagine:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Why the character looks like that.</strong></li>

<li><strong>What they do that requires them to wear these things.</strong></li>

<li><strong>How they exist in their world.</strong></li>

</ul>

<p>Connecting the dots between the design and their purpose or narrative helps me make motivated decisions. It ties together the character's appearance with their role and setting.</p>

<h2>Embracing Playfulness in the Creative Process</h2>

<p>This approach emphasizes:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Learning through observation</strong>: Studying real-life shapes and proportions.</li>

<li><strong>Playing with shapes</strong>: Using understood shapes to create new designs with ease.</li>

<li><strong>Evoking emotions</strong>: Aiming to get reactions from viewers by making them feel something.</li>

<li><strong>Storytelling through design</strong>: Letting the design process inspire narrative elements.</li>

</ul>

<p>I find that once I've <strong>studied something</strong>, it's much easier to <strong>play with those shapes</strong> and let creativity flow without overthinking. By exploring and combining different elements, I can design characters and stories that are both fun and meaningful.</p>
