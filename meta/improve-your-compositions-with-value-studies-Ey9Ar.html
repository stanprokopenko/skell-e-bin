<p>I'm going to do another demo for you, focusing on simplifying a composition into value studies. This composition is beautiful, simple, elegant, and masterfully done. The dark silhouette of the horse and the Native American running toward us creates a strong focal point. The background consists mostly of middle values, with a light dust cloud directly behind the focal point, creating the most contrast.</p>

<h2>Two-Value Simplification</h2>

<p>To start, I simplify the composition into <strong>two values</strong>. This involves combining the dark silhouette of the figures against the middle-value background. The composition becomes fairly simple:</p>

<ul>

<li>A <strong>wide shape at the top</strong> that goes diagonally, creating motion and movement.</li>

<li>The <strong>dark diagonal shape</strong> lacks symmetry and balance, making it dynamic.</li>

<li>Everything around this shape is light in comparison.</li>

</ul>

<p>If it were a perfectly vertical composition, it wouldn't be as interesting. The diagonal creates energy and draws the eye.</p>

<h2>Three-Value Study</h2>

<p>Next, I move to a <strong>three-value study</strong> and spend a bit more time on it. I lightly map in some of the shapes, being careful not to focus too much on measurement. In a thumbnail, it's more important to consider placement and general shapes rather than exact details.</p>

<p>I consider the negative shapes, like the area between the horse's legs or under the armpit. These shapes are crucial for the composition. For the legs, I'm not concerned with anatomy but rather the <strong>diagonal shape and the overall composition of values</strong>.</p>

<p>The <strong>cast shadow</strong> is important. I love how the artist loses the feet, blending them right into the shadow, and connecting the horse to the ground. There's a gradation from dark to medium tone, without a very specific shape, just a smooth transition.</p>

<h2>Analyzing Shapes and Values</h2>

<p>In the focal point, I think of very abstract shapes. I'm not drawing detailed horses but looking at which parts are part of the dark silhouette and which are middle values. For example:</p>

<ul>

<li>The <strong>front of the horse's face</strong> is in the middle value.</li>

<li>The <strong>back of the head</strong> merges with the dark silhouette.</li>

</ul>

<p>This area has the most small shapes, intentionally designed to bring the eye in. The smaller, delicate shapes create interest, while the rest remains as a big silhouette.</p>

<p>I notice that the artist doesn't highlight the hand with lighter values. Instead, the hand remains a <strong>dark silhouette against a light background</strong>. There are mid-value shapes that separate elements, like the horse from the rider, adding depth.</p>

<h2>Connecting to the Ground</h2>

<p>I question the value at the bottom area of the background. Is it a middle value or does it start to become dark? When I squint, it merges with the cast shadow, connecting the figures to the ground.</p>

<p>There are two approaches:</p>

<ol>

<li><strong>Simplify it</strong> so the silhouette stands out against a light background.</li>

<li><strong>Shade the bottom area as dark</strong>, connecting the silhouette to the ground and grounding it.</li>

</ol>

<p>By shading the bottom, I prevent the dark shape from appearing as if it's floating. It grounds the composition, making it feel more stable.</p>

<h2>Importance of Shape Design</h2>

<p>The more I look at the composition, the more beautiful it becomes. It's so dynamic, everything flows. The artist was definitely thinking of rhythms.</p>

<p>I remember to include the <strong>spear</strong>, a small but crucial detail. It's equivalent to adding eyes or a mouth in other compositions, tiny details that really matter. The spear provides context. If you <strong>oversimplify and lose critical information</strong>, you lose an important part of the story.</p>

<h2>Maintaining Context</h2>

<p>In larger thumbnails, like one that's about five inches tall, I want to keep some of the context without losing everything. I still want it to look like a horse. I keep the shapes simple, not trying to draw features but ensuring the overall form is recognizable.</p>

<p>For example, I use:</p>

<ul>

<li>A little hook for the nose.</li>

<li>Simple vertical and horizontal lines.</li>

<li>A small shadow under the jaw.</li>

</ul>

<p>Combined with the legs and spear, it's enough to convey that it's a horse.</p>

<h2>Observations on Value Relationships</h2>

<p>A key part of this composition is the <strong>dark focal point on a light background</strong>. Smaller details are pushed to mid-values to maintain the dark silhouette's impact against the light cloud behind it.</p>

<p>I adjust the values:</p>

<ul>

<li>Ensuring the cloud acts as a way to separate the horse's face from the background.</li>

<li>Not drawing every detail in the cloud but capturing the general shape.</li>

<li>Cleaning up the lightest values with an eraser to preserve the brightest areas.</li>

</ul>

<p>By smudging the background values and refining the edges, I enhance the contrast and clarity of the composition.</p>

<h2>Adjusting the Ground Plane</h2>

<p>Initially, the figures seemed to be floating, giving the impression of a cloud rather than a dust cloud. To address this, I:</p>

<ul>

<li>Add a <strong>dark silhouette of the ground</strong> around the edges.</li>

<li>Blend the cast shadows into the background.</li>

</ul>

<p>This not only grounds the figures but also improves the overall feel of the composition. It connects the dark silhouette to the ground, making it more cohesive.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p>I notice a subtle detail:</p>

<ul>

<li>Where the <strong>spear overlaps the hand</strong>, the spear becomes lighter just in that area.</li>

<li>This allows the spear to be visible over the hand before it becomes dark again behind it.</li>

</ul>

<p>Such small adjustments showcase the artist's intention and attention to detail, enhancing the composition's depth and readability.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p>By simplifying the composition into two and three values, analyzing shapes and value relationships, and paying attention to key details, we can appreciate the masterful design and learn to apply these principles in our own work.</p>
