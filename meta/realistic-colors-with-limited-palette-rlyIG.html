<p>I took some time to explain terms related to mixing and halftone, aiming to clarify these concepts.</p>

<h2>Mixing Halftones</h2>

<p>When I mix halftones, I often use <strong>mustard and ketchup colors</strong>. This time, I decided not to add white to the mixture. Instead, I added a bit of black to adjust the chroma. It's amazing how ketchup and mustard can reproduce browns. </p>

<h2>Color Choices and Palette</h2>

<p>My typical palette includes <strong>raw umber, transparent oxide brown, and red</strong>. However, I can approximate these with limited colors. I used to avoid black, thinking it was a dead color. Now, I see its potential for creating interesting browns and realistic grays.</p>

<h2>Palette Management</h2>

<p>I have colors on my palette for convenience, especially under deadlines. But this can lead to a lack of harmony. Limiting the palette can enhance harmony, though I sometimes rely on pre-mixed colors for time efficiency. Once mixed, I store the colors in jars to prevent them from drying out, allowing for breaks without issues.</p>

<h2>Practical Painting Tips</h2>

<p>My halftone mixture is slightly <strong>darker and warmer than the light</strong>, reflecting the local color as light diminishes. Highlights show the true color of the light source, while halftones reveal more of the object's local color. Halftones are darker as they are further from the light source, matching the subject's skin tone. </p>

<p>Matching values is challenging and requires practice. Squinting can help determine if values match. I might mix shadow and halftone for smoother transitions but will avoid blending for now. I have my average light, halftone, and shadow colors ready, simplifying the painting process.</p>

<h2>Paint Preservation and Preparation</h2>

<p>I preserve paint in jars to prevent drying, leaving some on the palette for immediate use. I label jars to keep track of mixtures, ensuring I have enough paint for the session. The shadow color dries fastest, so I store it promptly. I clean my palette and prepare to start painting, considering the preparation as part of the painting process. I have already mixed the necessary colors, so I won't repeat the mixing process on camera.</p>
