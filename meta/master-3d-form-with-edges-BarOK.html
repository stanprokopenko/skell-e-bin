<p>I’m working on a level-two shading exercise where I turn portrait references into simple “blobs.” My goal is to focus on <strong>edges</strong>, rather than getting lost in details. I keep everything as big, simplified forms, like lumps of clay, then worry about where the light lands and how to handle the edges around those shadows and highlights.</p>

<p>I’m not aiming for a perfect portrait. I want to practice seeing each part of the head as a blob with distinct planes and edges. This way I train my mind to interpret real faces in a more structural, three-dimensional way.</p>

<h2>Breaking the Head into Big Blobs</h2>

<p>I begin by imagining the overall shape of the skull as a large, rounded mass. Then I add the jaw, muzzle (the area around the lips), eye sockets, and cheeks as separate forms. Sometimes I think of the muzzle as a “tuna can,” a simple cylinder with top and bottom planes. For the cheeks, I sketch in rounded shapes that wrap around the eye sockets.</p>

<p>• I keep the lines light at first, focusing on the overlaps, who is in front and who is behind.

• I visualize the head like I’m molding clay, attaching lumps together, and cutting away or adding as needed.<br />

• Even though it’s a portrait reference, I stay loose and let the forms be a bit blobby, which helps me understand each plane more simply.</p>

<h2>Defining the Light Source</h2>

<p>Before shading, I decide where my light is coming from. In one example, I imagine a single light shining from the top-left. In another example, I flip it to the top-right, or I move it around. Knowing this helps me figure out where shadows will fall.</p>

<h2>Shading and Handling Edges</h2>

<p>Once I have my blobs, I shade each one according to its orientation to the light. I pay special attention to edges:</p>

<p>• <strong>Soft edges</strong> usually happen on rounded, fleshy areas or where light and shadow shift gradually over a curve.<br />

• <strong>Firm edges</strong> are more abrupt than soft but not razor-sharp. I might use them around forms that have a distinct corner or a firm shift in plane.<br />

• <strong>Sharp edges</strong> occur at sudden stops, often silhouettes or cast shadows. They’re crisp, with no smooth transition.</p>

<h3>Example: The Forehead and Nose</h3>

<p>On the forehead, if it’s more spherical, I see a <strong>soft edge</strong> where light blends into shadow. But the bridge of the nose might have <strong>sharp or firm edges</strong> if the bone or cartilage creates clear planes.</p>

<ol>

<li>I start by blocking in a big shadow shape.  </li>

<li>I check how soft or firm the transition is at every boundary of that shape.  </li>

<li>I use gradations for softer edges, a defined line for sharper ones, and something in between for firm edges.</li>

</ol>

<h3>Example: The Cheeks and Eye Socket</h3>

<p>The cheeks often have a rounded mass. I give them a <strong>soft gradation</strong> into shadow. Where the shadow meets bony areas or cast shadows, I might switch to a <strong>firm or sharp</strong> edge. In the eye socket, I have a rounded eyeball hidden under strong brow ridges. I note the transitions all around that shape, especially where cast shadows under the eyebrow can create sharp lines.</p>

<h3>The Neck as a Cylinder</h3>

<p>If I’m including the neck, I treat it like a big cylinder:</p>

<p>• I figure out which side is lit.<br />

• I keep the shadow side separate.<br />

• I then smooth in a half tone for the transition.</p>

<h2>Inverting or Inventing the Light</h2>

<p>In some examples, I repeat the same drawing of a head and just <strong>change the light direction</strong>. This helps me understand how shadows shift on the same blobs. I treat each part on its own, like:</p>

<ol>

<li>Identify the top plane where the light first hits.  </li>

<li>Mark the opposite side or underside as shadow.  </li>

<li>Decide how firm or soft each edge will be based on the form’s structure.</li>

</ol>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p>This blob approach lets me focus on the big statements, where the planes face the light and how each edge feels. Every small wrinkle or detail should support that big, three dimensional idea. If I keep my core forms consistent and design my edges carefully, the drawing looks more solid and believable, even when I simplify the portrait into simple shapes.</p>
