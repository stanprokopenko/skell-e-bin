<p>Drawing the figure can feel overwhelming. There’s anatomy, lighting, and the challenge of capturing something we all recognize. I like to <strong>simplify</strong> and treat most parts of the body as <strong>tubes</strong>. Tubes allow me to show gesture, structure, and position without getting stuck in too much detail. As I refine, I can add corners and tapering to make each tube more characteristic.</p>

<h2>Why Tubes?</h2>

<p>Tubes are a <strong>three-dimensional gesture</strong>. They reveal how something moves in space along its <strong>long axis</strong> and around its <strong>short axis</strong>. Using tubes:<br />

- Helps me keep the drawing simple yet expressive.<br />

- Establishes a sense of perspective, proportion, and flow.<br />

- Is flexible, I can make them parallel, curved, tapered, or even slightly kinked.</p>

<p>When in doubt, I return to this basic shape to keep things clear.</p>

<h2>Constructing Tubes</h2>

<p>First, I imagine a <strong>long axis</strong>, that central curve of the limb or torso. Then I draw parallel lines around it, or I let one side curve more than the other. This is enough to capture the overall shape. Many body parts taper toward the ends, like the forearm, while others feel more parallel, like much of the upper arm.</p>

<p>I avoid letting two curves cancel each other out. I want an <strong>obvious flow</strong> in the tube so it feels dynamic. I also watch out for overemphasizing bulging muscles. Simplifying with tubes prevents me from making the figure look stiff or overly detailed at this early stage.</p>

<h2>Applying Tubes to the Figure</h2>

<p>I often start with the <strong>head</strong> as a bucket or conical shape, then attach a neck tube. The <strong>torso</strong> can be a large bent tube, like a big bolster pillow. You can bend or kink it to capture a hunch or twist. I might add small corners where I see bony landmarks or joints, but I keep the main shape intact around the long axis.</p>

<p>For the <strong>arms and legs</strong>:<br />

- I look for the lasting curve. For example, a bicep might flow from shoulder to elbow, while the tricep breaks away sooner.<br />

- I start with the tube, then clip or curve it off where I know a new form begins.<br />

- If I’m not sure how something connects, I allow the tube to “curl off,” suggesting a transition to the next form later.  </p>

<p>I also draw through hidden areas lightly, imagining the body as if made of <strong>transparent glass</strong>. For example, if the torso blocks view of the shoulder or hips, I still sketch those lines behind it to keep my spatial understanding.</p>

<h2>Building Confidence and Refinement</h2>

<p>Drawing tubes first helps me ignore complicated surface details and focus on <strong>structure and gesture</strong>. After blocking in those forms, I can refine proportions, add more detailed shapes around the joints, and adjust curves or corners to reflect the anatomy more precisely.</p>

<p>I don’t worry about perfect proportions on my first pass. I look for the big, simple shapes, correct as I go, and gradually dial in accuracy. This way, I avoid getting lost or stiff in my figure drawings.</p>

<p>With consistent practice, tubes become a powerful connective strategy. They keep the figure cohesive, fluid, and open for later refinement.</p>
