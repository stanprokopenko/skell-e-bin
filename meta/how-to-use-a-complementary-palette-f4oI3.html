<h2>Understanding the Complementary Palette</h2>

<p>A complementary palette adds one more hue to the monochromatic palette, using colors found on opposite sides of the color wheel. For example, yellow's complement is purple, and red's complement is green. The complement must be directly across the color wheel to be a pure complement. This palette uses a color and its opposite to build a painting, offering a full range of saturation levels through these two colors.</p>

<h2>Setting Up the Canvas</h2>

<p>I start by setting up a 1500x1200 pixel canvas for this sketch study. Here's a tip: use the crop tool to easily make your canvas bigger if needed. I create a basic line drawing of the scene on a separate layer, simplifying complex elements like the monster into a sphere for easier color study. I set the line drawing layer to multiply mode.</p>

<h2>Choosing and Applying Colors</h2>

<p>For this demonstration, I choose orange and blue as my complementary colors. Orange represents sunlight, while blue represents the sky and shadows - a realistic pairing. I create a small color chart at the bottom of the canvas as a reference.</p>

<p>I decide on warm (orange) light for the scene. I start by "killing the white of the canvas" to avoid middle gray. Then, I block in basic colors for different elements like the sky, monster, and bridge. I adjust saturation levels to differentiate local colors of objects.</p>

<h3>Light and Shadow</h3>

<p>I choose a side light from the right for this scene. I use the multiply brush mode for shadows and gradually build up color temperatures in light and shadow areas. <strong>Warm light acts as a "bully," imposing its hue and saturation on surfaces it hits.</strong></p>

<p>To create shadows, I "scumble" in neutralized blues. This helps build the color temperature range. It's important to cool off shadow areas by moving towards blues on the color wheel.</p>

<h3>Color Temperature</h3>

<p>I start with less saturated colors and build to extremes as the painting progresses. For shadowed areas, I block in aggressive blue, then build in warmer reflected light. <strong>Be careful not to make reflected light too bright, as it can look unrealistic.</strong> As a general rule, I keep reflected light cooler than direct light.</p>

<h2>Painting Techniques</h2>

<p>I switch from an airbrush to a textured brush for more definitive strokes. I use the overlay blending mode for subtle reflected light effects. To create a sketchy, study-like appearance, I use varied brush strokes.</p>

<p><strong>Avoid hard outlines - vary edge softness, line width, and value for a natural look.</strong> I use brush scattering settings to add background noise like leaves and twigs, then work back into these scattered brush strokes with a regular brush to reduce repetition.</p>

<h3>Adding Depth and Realism</h3>

<p>I add occlusion shadows (also called ambient occlusion) under the monster and between stones. To create depth, I use atmospheric perspective to reduce contrast on distant elements. I create dappled light effects on the grass with varying shapes and sizes.</p>

<p>For realism, I add imperfections and variations to the bricks. I also use small shapes in the background to create a more fleshed-out environment.</p>

<h2>Refining the Painting</h2>

<p>As I refine the painting, I work on specific elements:</p>

<ul>

<li>For the monster, I define its fur texture through silhouette strokes and add dimension to its eyes with dark sockets and glossy highlights.</li>

<li>On the bridge, I paint occlusion shadows between stones and add catch lights and shadows to give dimension to the stones.</li>

<li>In the background, I vary the sky color temperature by scumbling warmer blues over cooler ones.</li>

</ul>

<p>I create subtle glow effects mimicking bounce light and camera lens effects. I add horizontal strokes in the water to suggest reflections and paint an occlusion shadow where land meets water.</p>

<h2>Tips for Effective Learning</h2>

<p><strong>It's better to do multiple unfinished paintings in a day to explore color, rather than one detailed finished painting.</strong> The mileage from quick studies helps with decision-making in future work.</p>

<p>I regularly flip the canvas horizontally to reveal composition issues. Instead of using the undo function, I paint over mistakes to foster a "sketching" mindset.</p>

<p>Remember, quantity of practice is often better than quality when learning principles. Limited color palettes help focus on value and ease into color work. Don't be afraid to experiment and make mistakes - that's how we learn and improve our skills.</p>
