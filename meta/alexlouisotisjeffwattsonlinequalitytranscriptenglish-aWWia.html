<p>How are you all doing out there? I'm really honored to be a part of this video. Stan's an old friend of mine and was a student of mine many years ago. I run an atelier here in Southern California called Watts Atelier of the Arts. We've had it for about 30 years now, and quite a lineage of great draftsmen and painters have come through our doors and gone on to do amazing things, like Stan with Proko and what he's doing now to further this knowledge base for all of you.</p>

<p>I'm hoping I can add a little insight into what it means to have good <strong>line weight quality</strong>. I've been doing this most of my life, and it's such an amazing vocabulary that you develop as an artist to express yourself three-dimensionally on flat surfaces or even in sculpting.</p>

<h2>The Journey of Learning Art</h2>

<p>The drawing I chose to showcase is quite advanced, and I know many of you are just getting your sea legs with this stuff. It can be a little daunting to look at something like this, but I want it to be more inspirational as far as where you're heading in your future efforts. A lot of this is a culmination of many years of acquiring skill sets, very similar to learning a language.</p>

<p>You have to learn the alphabet, and then start doing cursive. Ultimately, you put that together into basic sentences, basic grammar, then writing paragraphs, composing short stories, and maybe one day writing a novel. Many of you right now are in those beginning stages of just getting an understanding of what the vocabulary is. Here's a curve, an S-curve, a C-curve, a straight, how you control the line weight of your hand onto a surface. What kind of surface is it?</p>

<p>All these things are slight nuances of this language you're going to be learning. Think of them as <strong>visual languages</strong>. You might have charcoal, which has a certain syntax or quality to it, but you also have graphite, watercolor, gouache, and all the painting mediums as well. Each one represents a visual language that you're going to learn and hopefully master. Then you'll express yourself with beautiful imagery that's either of a narrative bend or simply a beautiful drawing of an individual in a costume like this.</p>

<p>When I'm training people and taking them through the hierarchy of knowledge, they have to learn to be articulate in these languages. It's a very patient, long-game mentality that you need to adopt. Think of it like saying, "I want to learn Russian, but I speak English, and I want to learn it in a week." It's not very feasible. You'd have to immerse yourself in the language, any language.</p>

<p>The nice thing about drawing is that the commonality among all the languages is the same. If you understand an edge or value in charcoal, it translates into other mediums as the same edge. It still needs to be a hard edge in oil, graphite, and even in sculpting.</p>

<h2>Visual Language and Mediums</h2>

<p>In the drawing I chose, it exemplifies a very heavy, <strong>calligraphic style</strong> of drawing. Think of calligraphy as your handwriting, the style that you write in. Everyone has an inherent style of writing that evolves over time, and that's how you sign your name, bend your "E's," and so on.</p>

<p>You can think of the same thing in drawing. Over time, you're going to cultivate a sensitivity that's already in you, but we may use other artists to emulate their calligraphy, their handwriting, until your own matures. That could be years, depending on the complexity of the people you're emulating.</p>

<p>This particular drawing has a tonal feel, meaning it looks like the reality we experience in our everyday life. We don't walk around seeing a bunch of cross-hatching everywhere, at least hopefully not! When you're translating that into a drawing, you can leave some line in as design, but it's not the way the world represents itself. The world represents itself in clean tone, edge, and value.</p>

<h2>Line Weight and Quality</h2>

<p>Once you understand those basic building blocks, you'll find that they build on themselves quite exponentially. It will happen quicker, and you won't have to think about it as much years down the road. There's a lot of light at the end of the tunnel, trust me! But it does require a lot of <strong>sweat equity</strong>, which means sitting down at the board, working from reference or even invention, and just doing it daily, weekly, monthly, yearly, and setting goals for yourself.</p>

<p>The main overarching focus of this is <strong>aesthetics</strong>. We're looking at various qualities of line weight that represent tone, kind of combining two different methodologies or philosophies. One is a line for line's sake to represent tone, meaning that I have a certain value, let's say, for lack of complexity, we have ten values. If I want to represent a mid-tone value somewhere in drapery with a lot of folds and sub-folds, I use line weight to convey that.</p>

<p>In this particular drawing, I was inspired by an artist named <strong>Alphonse Mucha</strong>, and partially that was due to the fact that the paper I was working on took the graphite in a way that led me to want to work in that calligraphy. I've studied a lot of this particular artist's work over the years, so I was able to quickly pivot and go into these nuances.</p>

<p>I go into these little swirly nuances within these cavities of drapery. Normally, when I look at this guy's drapery, there were not a lot of swirls, that was my interpretation, <strong>calligraphically</strong>, a design aesthetic. These are fancy words for just making things look cool.</p>

<h2>Design and Aesthetics in Drawing</h2>

<p>This is very advanced drawing, this is kind of your end game, maybe ten years down the road. I know many of you are thinking, "Ten years?" But believe me, it goes by like that. Study diligently and work towards specific goals because you could be quite a different artist ten years from now, or you could be pretty much the same as you are now if you don't train properly. So you definitely want to think about those concepts.</p>

<p>Again, the line is representing a certain value. If I push really hard on the pencil, it's going to draw up a darker value, and that's going to cause that area to look like a darker halftone or maybe a darker part of that particular fabric. If it's lighter, then I either want to push lighter or I want to separate my lines out. There are many different ways you can do that.</p>

<p>Ultimately, when you step back from this drawing and squint at it, I want it to look very believable, I want it to look like reality. But if you walk up on it and look closely, you're going to see a myriad of different calligraphic interpretations glued together in a way that, yes, looks like reality, but through a veil of design. That design is heavily influenced by an artist's biases towards things, what they like, dislike, how they see the world, and how they appreciate it.</p>

<p>That's something you'll cultivate over time and mature into, very much like the nuance of a singer or a musician or a poet or a writer.</p>

<h2>Interpreting Form Through Line</h2>

<p>When I look at this particular drawing, if we go down to the skull, for example, you can see there's a little thesis study in and of itself, this is a little anatomical study that happens to be part of this narrative of this story. This was a class I taught at Watts Atelier, and it was a streaming class. I taught it week to week, and people followed along with me.</p>

<p>We have this skull here, it is in a semi-finished state. I say semi-finished because there's more work that can be done on it, it can be smoothed out, I could take out some of the lines, but the lines are representing pieces of nuanced aspects of this skull, the zygomatic bone, the cheekbone, the nasal cavity, brow ridge, the mandible.</p>

<p>These are not fancy names to impress you but to impress upon you the need to understand what it is you're drawing so that you can then design it. There's an old saying: <strong>It's difficult to indicate what you don't know</strong>, and I would go so far as to say it's almost impossible to indicate something attractively that you don't know.</p>

<p>So, you have to filter it through a knowledge of this particular form. You might say, "How am I supposed to get the knowledge of that form?" Well, you could buy a skull cast or one of Stan's little skulls, they're really cool. You could have it in front of you on your drawing board, you could draw from that, and you could familiarize yourself with the angles and the bevels of these particular nuanced aspects of, say, a skull.</p>

<h3>Using Line to Represent Value</h3>

<p>When you're doing these little cross-hatching notes, think of notes in music, you want to go with or against the form. Now, this is where it gets kind of tricky because there might be a form going one way, and you might wonder whether to draw with it or against it. That is where the nuance comes in.</p>

<p>The decision you make, whether to crosshatch with or against a form, has a lot to do with what you've done elsewhere. So you have to think of the context of the whole as you work on the parts, and vice versa. It's a very complex way of thinking.</p>

<p>Give yourself a lot of room for experimentation, and don't expect it to look great immediately. Champion your little successes. Maybe you do a little area of this skull and it looks pretty good, but then you go the wrong direction somewhere else, and it doesn't look quite as good. Make a mental note, let's make a course correction, let's try it a different direction if we can.</p>

<h3>Working with Values and Edges</h3>

<p>Line weight is connected to <strong>edges</strong>. Soft edges recede, and hard edges come forward. Black will also accentuate the hard edge you've made, and make it come forward even more. So how far and how much do you want to punch the viewer in the face with this edge?</p>

<p>If you use the wrong edge around a form, it would start to misrepresent that area. The edge and line weight are connected. The value comes after. Value has very little to do with edge and line weight, but line weight has a lot to do with edge.</p>

<p>If we're doing cross-hatching to make it look like a value, then yes, the line has a lot to do with the interpretation of that value. But if we're doing it more like a scaffolding from which we're going to put a clean tone into and the lines are secondary, they're just to contain where those values are going to be placed, then we may go back and relook at those lines we've used or chosen for the different areas and ask if they still are adequate to express the three-dimensionality of the form.</p>

<h2>Learning Through Practice and Patience</h2>

<p>As we draw, line weights are going to be very important to interpreting how things look. Now we're back into the realm of reality, and this guy does have a skull. It's nice that I know a lot about it because when I go to interpret the muscles that are on top of the skull in this face, that remembrance of the skull from having studied it so much will affect how I draw this.</p>

<p>You may not think that's true, you might say, "I don't see any skull there, I don't see any of this stuff you were just showing in that last drawing." But that's maybe a very rudimentary way to think of it because in this face, there are areas where the muscles are less and the bones are more prevalent, around the brow ridge, maybe in the zygomatic cheekbone area, the nasal bone before it goes to cartilage on the tip of the nose.</p>

<p>These are all nuanced aspects of muscles, you'll learn. The point being is that you have to be articulate with expressing yourself and be able to share the reality through line, <strong>line quality</strong> to represent form on a flat surface and make it look real.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p>This conversation wasn't meant to intimidate you, it was just to say that there is a lot to learn in front of you, and it's beautiful, amazing stuff. Ultimately, this is a science, and it is also an intuitive experience. Part of it's thinking, part of it's feeling, feeling, thinking, thinking, feeling, back and forth. If you think too much, it's going to get stiff and uptight, if you feel too much, it's going to get sloppy and out of control. You've got to have both.</p>

<p>Right now, it's best to learn through thinking because that's the gateway to intuition. This will come later. A lot of what I'm doing here has an intuitive element to it, that's where the fun nuance comes in for me.</p>

<p>There's a ton to look forward to. I hope this helped a little bit and didn't confuse you. It was really meant to inspire you as to what's in front of you. You're in good hands with Proko and Stan and the team. Thanks for having me, and hopefully this helped a little bit with line weight.</p>
