<p>Hey everyone, I'm Alex Sinclair, a comic colorist. I've been in the industry for over 32 years, and I want to share my journey and some insights into becoming a colorist in comics.</p>

<h2>My Path to Becoming a Colorist</h2>

<p>Becoming a colorist started with me being a failed penciler, which is a story many inkers and colorists share. I showed my portfolio with pencils, inks, and colors. While I received critiques on both pencils and inks, everyone really liked my color samples. It took me a couple of years to realize that coloring was where I excelled.</p>

<p>At the time, Jim Lee had his own studio and was conducting a talent search. I decided to send only color samples, thinking I could use that to get into the industry and eventually become a penciler. Sure enough, two weeks later, I got a call from Jim inviting me to join the studio. Thirty-two years later, I'm still coloring because I realized that was my thing. I still draw and paint, but when it comes to comics, coloring is definitely my passion.</p>

<h2>The Importance of Artistic Foundation</h2>

<p>You need to have a <strong>strong artistic base</strong> to be able to ink, color, and obviously pencil. You don't have to be the best penciler out there to be able to color, but you need that knowledge behind you because all those concepts translate. You use them differently as a penciler, inker, or colorist, but you use them all. So having that background in art is essential to pull off any of these three specialties.</p>

<h2>Understanding Collaboration in Comics</h2>

<p>Remember that creating comics is a <strong>collaboration</strong>. You're working after one or two artists, and you need to respect what was done before you. But don't be afraid to bring your own flair and style to what you're doing. You're part of building the final product, coming in at the end to help put it all together and make sure that when it's presented, it's a solid package.</p>

<h2>Enhancing Storytelling Through Color</h2>

<p>As a colorist, you're reading the inks that are there, and these will establish your light sources. You're also helping to add <strong>mood</strong>, <strong>drama</strong>, and augment the <strong>storytelling</strong>. You're adding a lot in those ways, not that it's not there already, but you want to <strong>enhance</strong> it.</p>

<p>Reading the script is a big part of coloring interiors. I read the script for every book I work on because it helps establish the time of day, location, and sometimes the writer will drop specific color notes for what they want to see on a page. I take a lot of cues from both the script and the art. Putting the two together, I then decide on the palette I'll use and what colors will help the characters pop, or not pop, depending on what's happening on each page. There are decisions I'm making from panel to panel, page to page, scene to scene, and book to book, and these are influenced by the script and the art.</p>

<h2>Advice for Aspiring Colorists</h2>

<p>I often see portfolios that only have covers, and one of the things I tell aspiring colorists is to <strong>color interiors</strong> because that's the job. A cover comes here and there, but the bulk of the work you'll do is 20 pages of interior work.</p>

<p>My advice is to download inks, get inks from artists, and color five-page sequences. Color three or four of them, you want to show that you can <strong>tell the story</strong>, add mood and drama, and help the art by making the characters that need to pop stand out and adding special effects to enhance the drama and action. It's more about seeing interior work, not covers. Yes, you want to show that you can do covers as well, but the hard part of coloring is storytelling and doing interiors.</p>

<h2>Adapting to Advancements in Technology</h2>

<p>Technology is always improving and changing. Sometimes it plateaus, but then something new comes along, and you jump on it because it might be the next big thing. We saw this with Photoshop as it evolved from being a photographer's aid program to a painting program. Competing programs also help improve the industry.</p>

<p>There are so many different programs you can use, it's not just Photoshop. <strong>Clip Studio</strong> is another great program that many people use for drawing, inking, and coloring. <strong>Procreate</strong> and the iPad have really changed things, you can carry this one around everywhere. I use Procreate to color when I'm on an airplane, I have an iPad, and I'm coloring on it. It's a great tool, and I use both Procreate and Photoshop together to produce my work.</p>

<p>Technology is always evolving and improving, and keeping up with that is part of the job and part of the process. Having competition is always great. Even as an artist, you're always improving because you don't know who is coming next. You need to improve and continue to grow as an artist because you want to stay ahead of the new artists entering the industry, the young guns looking to knock you off your pedestal.</p>

<h2>Improving Efficiency in Your Workflow</h2>

<p>Your workspace is a big part of <strong>efficiency</strong> and <strong>speed</strong>. Make sure you learn the shortcuts to the different programs you use. If we're using Photoshop as an example, there are hotkeys you can use. Instead of using the tool palette, you're pressing a key and saving yourself the movement of going to the tool and back. It's a short movement, yes, but if you eliminate it by just pressing a key with your left hand, you can continue to work more fluidly.</p>

<p>I work a lot with Wacom and their products. I use tools like the <strong>ExpressKey Remote</strong>, and I program keystrokes into it. They also have on-screen menus that pop up that I use with the pen. I program them so that when I click a button on the remote, a menu pops up, and from that, I can select various functions. This feeds the efficiency of my process.</p>

<p>With my setup at home, my keyboard is actually off to the side, and I rarely use it because my hands are all here, and I'm working continuously. In an industry where you get <strong>paid per page</strong>, the more pages you produce, the more you can make. You want to build yourself into an efficient working machine that can turn the pages faster. Learning these tools is vital.</p>

<p>Using a keyboard has become a crutch for me because I have to look down and find the key, whereas I've already programmed everything into my remote, and my muscle memory moves my fingers immediately to the tool I need at the moment I need it. It gives me the extra movement elsewhere.</p>

<h2>My Current Workload</h2>

<p>I'm usually doing about <strong>three books a month</strong>. When you add covers into the mix or the amount of covers, it ends up being about three and a half to four books a month. It's a busy month-to-month gig for me.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p>Being a colorist is about more than just adding color to a page. It's about enhancing the storytelling, adding mood and drama, and collaborating with other artists to create a cohesive and compelling final product. It's important to have a strong artistic foundation, stay adaptable with advancing technology, and continually improve your efficiency and skills. I hope my journey and insights can help aspiring colorists navigate their own paths in the comics industry.</p>
