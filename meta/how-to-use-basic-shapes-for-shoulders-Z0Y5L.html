<h2>Simplify with Curves and Corners</h2>

<p>You can start by thinking of the shoulders and upper back in terms of <strong>curves and corners</strong>. When you feel stuck, simplify the shapes. Use a curved line for continuous flow or use corners when the form changes direction.</p>

<h2>The “Sailboat Triangle”</h2>

<p>The shoulder blade looks like a <strong>sailboat-shaped triangle</strong>. In practice, you usually only draw part of this triangle. You focus on:

- <strong>The Spine</strong> (the ridge along the top of the blade)<br />

- <strong>The Blade</strong> (the rest of the triangle, often kept parallel to the spine)</p>

<p>Because the blade can slide around on the rib cage, it looks different in each pose. It “floats” rather than locking in one place like the pelvis does.</p>

<h2>Corner to Corner</h2>

<p>The top ridge of the shoulder blade and the collarbone can give you a <strong>corner</strong> at each shoulder. These corners help you see how the neck transitions into the broader thorax. Even if you simplify them later, try to place these corners first. You can always refine with curves later.</p>

<h2>The Upside-Down L</h2>

<p>Another simple approach is to see the shoulder blade as an <strong>upside-down L</strong>. You can draw it as a corner and a short line dropping down toward the arm. Even if you don’t show the entire triangle, hinting at the spine of the blade can strengthen your construction.</p>

<h2>Boxy Architecture of the Upper Back</h2>

<p>When you place both shoulder blades, they create a slight <strong>box feeling</strong> across the upper back. Imagine a “roof” shape where you move from the <strong>skinny neck</strong> to the <strong>thicker rib cage</strong>.<br />

- The neck sits in the center.<br />

- Each shoulder blade sits off to the side, forming the first <strong>corner plane</strong>.<br />

- The middle between them forms another vertical plane down the spine.  </p>

<p>Visualize this in terms of three planes: one near each shoulder blade and one between them.</p>

<h2>Working in Profile</h2>

<p>In a <strong>profile view</strong>, you often see one shoulder blade at a time. It can appear as a small corner or a short L shape on the upper back. You might draw:<br />

1. A simple corner at the top of the shoulder.<br />

2. The edge of the shoulder blade dropping down.  </p>

<p>Connect the arm with a curved line or with an egg-like shape for the deltoid. This helps you show how the arm meets the torso.</p>

<h2>Connecting the Arm</h2>

<p>You often see a gentle <strong>S-curve</strong> where the shoulder transitions into the arm. In profile, place a <strong>corner</strong> for the top of the arm, then let a curve bridge the shoulder into the deltoid area. If you see a highlight or a clear edge, you can mark it with a corner. If not, use a smooth curve.</p>

<h2>Room for Error</h2>

<p>When you simplify, there is plenty of <strong>room for error</strong>. Placing a corner or a short line in the right general spot does the job. You don’t have to be exact with anatomy. Your goal is to show form changes in a clear, structured way.</p>

<p>Use this approach to create a more <strong>nuanced</strong> yet still <strong>simple</strong> construction of the upper back and shoulders. If you run into problems, return to the basic shapes, curves and corners. Then decide whether to refine by inserting an extra line, an L shape, or a sailboat triangle for the shoulder blade.</p>
