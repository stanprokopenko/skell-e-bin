<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>You want to think of the head as having <strong>two main parts</strong>, the skull and the face. The skull is generally <strong>round</strong>, and can vary in depth (sometimes shorter or taller). The face has more <strong>box-like architecture</strong> with key features, eyes, nose, mouth, and jaw, forming planes that step forward.</p>

<p>You won’t get into complex perspective drawing here, but you will focus on an <strong>intuitive approach</strong>. You’ll align the side of the head with the front, using simple box logic to make the head feel structured. You’ll place the ear in relation to the brow or the eye line, and that will help keep everything in position as you move the head around in different angles.</p>

<h2>Skull vs. Face</h2>

<p>• <strong>Skull</strong>: A large, round form. Most hairstyles follow and expand on this shape.<br />

• <strong>Face</strong>: Has more pronounced planes and angles, think of the eye sockets, nose, jaw, and chin as noticeable steps.</p>

<p>When drawing, consider the skull as a <strong>big circle or oval</strong> and place the more <strong>box-like face</strong> underneath it. This creates a “front vs. side” logic that helps you nail perspective.</p>

<h2>The Eyebrow Line</h2>

<p>Use the <strong>eyebrow line</strong> as a landmark. It indicates the <strong>top of your eye sockets</strong>. To find it:<br />

• Roughly divide the head (no hair) into thirds: from hairline to brow, from brow to the bottom of the nose, then from nose to the bottom of the chin.<br />

• The <strong>eyebrow arch</strong> can be subtle or dramatic, but it marks where the face transitions from a front plane to a side plane.  </p>

<p>Pay special attention to where the <strong>ear</strong> sits compared to that eyebrow line. It might align with the brows, the eyes, or even be slightly above or below.</p>

<h2>Ear Placement and Box Logic</h2>

<p>The ear sits on the <strong>side plane</strong> of the head. Once you lock in the brow line, you can measure how far back the ear should go. The <strong>front of the ear</strong> is roughly at the midpoint between the forehead and the back of the skull, though it often tilts backward.</p>

<p>If you imagine a <strong>box</strong> around the face, that box has:<br />

• A <strong>front plane</strong> for the forehead, eye sockets, nose, mouth, and chin.<br />

• A <strong>side plane</strong> for the temple and the side of the cheek and jaw.<br />

• An <strong>edge</strong> that separates the front from the side, which often aligns with the eyebrow’s outer quality and the area near the zygomatic arch.</p>

<h2>Building the Profile</h2>

<p>When you draw a face in profile:<br />

1. Start with a <strong>clean silhouette</strong> or a simple shape (like a sailboat triangle) to mark overall proportions.<br />

2. Locate the <strong>eye socket</strong> by placing the eyebrow line, then curve a shallow “C” shape or reverse “C” to define where the forehead transitions to the side of the temple.<br />

3. Place the <strong>ear</strong> about halfway into the skull’s width, tilting it slightly.<br />

4. Add the <strong>jawline</strong> and <strong>chin</strong>, noticing how the nose and mouth move forward from the brow.  </p>

<p>Keep lines <strong>light</strong> at first, so you can compare features and adjust quickly.</p>

<h2>Practical Construction Tips</h2>

<p>• <strong>Check Proportions</strong>: The distance from hairline to brow, brow to nose, and nose to chin is roughly one-third each.<br />

• <strong>Adjust as Needed</strong>: Everyone’s proportions vary. Compare your ideal proportions to the model and tweak ear height and chin length.<br />

• <strong>Keep It Simple</strong>: Focus on building a solid structure first. Extra details like eyelids, subtle angles, and muscle forms come later.  </p>

<h2>Moving Forward</h2>

<p>Once you feel comfortable with these foundational ideas, practice drawing front, three-quarter, and various tilted angles. You’ll apply the same <strong>box logic</strong> to line up the ear with the main features and keep that front plane and side plane clear. This approach helps you build confident drawings of the head in many poses.</p>
