<h2>What's in Premium?</h2>

<p>In this lesson, we study the eye using classical sculpture references to focus on the underlying structures without the distractions of color and detail. You'll learn how to sketch the eye from both profile and front views, starting with key anatomical landmarks like the brow ridge, eye socket, nasal bone, and zygomatic bone. We guide you through the process of blocking in the eye socket, indicating the eyeball, and rendering the eyelids and shadows to create depth.</p>

<p>You'll also explore techniques for maintaining symmetry using gestural lines, simplifying complex shapes with straights before refining with curves, and accurately placing features like the iris and pupil. The lesson emphasizes understanding the anatomy of the eye, the importance of light source awareness, and the benefits of studying sculptures to enhance your drawing skills.</p>
