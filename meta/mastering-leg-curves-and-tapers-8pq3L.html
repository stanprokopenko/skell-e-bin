<h2>Basic Taper of the Thigh</h2>

<p>I like to start by simplifying the thigh as a taper. In profile, the <strong>front side</strong> of the thigh tends to have a fuller curve, while the <strong>back side</strong> is straighter or slightly curved. Even on more muscular figures with defined shapes, the front carries the larger sweep down to the knee. The back, or hamstring area, usually shows subtler curves.</p>

<p>I imagine the thigh connecting from the “ball” of the hip down toward the knee. I’ll often place a simplified vertical or near-vertical line to help me see how tilted or curved the leg really is. If I see that it’s nearly vertical, I like to reinforce that in my drawing so I have <strong>structural support</strong>. From there, I can adjust the curvature to capture the contour’s flow.</p>

<h2>The S Curve of the Lower Leg</h2>

<p>Below the knee, the leg frequently forms a nice <strong>S curve</strong>. I look for a gentle rhythm that weaves from the back of the calf around to the front, then continues into the foot. Sometimes there’s a small bump or corner, but mostly it’s a fluid transition. And again, I keep an eye out for any vertical lines to anchor the shape and measure how far off that axis the curves are.</p>

<h2>Bending the Leg at the Knee</h2>

<p>When the leg is bent, the taper looks different because the shapes bunch up at the knee. Instead of a smooth transition, there may be a clearer <strong>corner</strong> or several corners where the thigh and calf change direction. Sometimes I see two or three chiselled corners if the figure is especially muscular or the bend is more pronounced.</p>

<p>If the knee is bent in perspective, I visualize it as a hinged shape. The thigh moves in one direction, the lower leg extends in another, and I look for how those shapes overlap or connect.</p>

<p>That’s the basic overview of drawing the upper leg in profile and how it ties into the lower leg. I keep an eye on the taper, the fullness or subtlety of curves, and the corners at the knee when the leg bends. With these ideas, I can capture the fluid design of the entire leg.</p>
