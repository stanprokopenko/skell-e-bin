<h2>The Eight-Step Head Drawing Process</h2>

<p>The head drawing process consists of eight key steps, divided into three main phases:</p>

<p><strong>Gesture and Basic Structure (Steps 1-4)</strong></p>

<ol>

<li>Shape of the skull</li>

<li>Tilt or two-dimensional axes</li>

<li>Jaw and cross (combination of center line and brow)</li>

<li>Perspective (determined by brow relationship to ear)</li>

</ol>

<p><strong>Proportions (Step 5)</strong></p>

<ol>

<li>Marking halves and thirds between brow to chin</li>

</ol>

<p><strong>Perspective and Features (Steps 6-8)</strong></p>

<ol>

<li>Four points to a side plane (developing ear, jaw, and cheek)</li>

<li>Eye sockets as a visor</li>

<li>Nose development, denture sphere, and chin</li>

</ol>

<h2>Homework Assignment: 20 Head Drawings</h2>

<p>Your homework is to complete <strong>20 head drawings</strong>, divided into two groups:</p>

<ol>

<li>

<p><strong>10 drawings building on prior work</strong>: </p>

<ul>

<li>Start with drawings you feel confident about, reaching at least step 5 or 6</li>

<li>Focus on adding the newer steps: visor, nose, denture sphere, and chin</li>

</ul>

</li>

<li>

<p><strong>10 new drawings from scratch</strong>:</p>

<ul>

<li>Work through all eight steps</li>

<li>This helps build greater familiarity with the entire process</li>

</ul>

</li>

</ol>

<h2>Time Management and Learning Approach</h2>

<p><strong>Aim for 10-15 minute exercises</strong> for each drawing. This time limit is crucial for several reasons:</p>

<ul>

<li>It <strong>forces repetition</strong>, which is key to learning</li>

<li>It helps <strong>ingrain the process</strong> into your muscle memory</li>

<li>It prevents you from <strong>getting stuck on details</strong></li>

</ul>

<p>Remember, the goal is to make the process <strong>routine and habitual</strong>. By setting time boundaries, you're creating "guardrails" for your practice.</p>

<h2>Instructor's Advice</h2>

<ul>

<li><strong>Shorter time limits are beneficial</strong>. They force you to stop, restart, and repeat the process, reinforcing your learning.</li>

<li><strong>Avoid the temptation to perfect details</strong>. With a 20-minute limit, you might find yourself focusing too much on perfecting individual features.</li>

<li><strong>Embrace repetition</strong>. It's through repeated practice that the process will become second nature to you.</li>

</ul>

<p>Good luck with your homework! Your instructor looks forward to critiquing your work and seeing your progress through these exercises.</p>
