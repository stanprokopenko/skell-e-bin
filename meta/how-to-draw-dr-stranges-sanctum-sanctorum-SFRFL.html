<h2>Infusing Personality into Building Exteriors</h2>

<p>Infusing personality into the exterior of buildings is challenging but essential. Aim to make the building <strong>dynamic, fun, and fitting within the Marvel Universe</strong>. Focus on understanding the exterior and making it <strong>impactful and memorable</strong>.</p>

<h2>Composition Techniques</h2>

<p>Approach the composition with <strong>flexibility</strong>, not worrying too much about the end result initially. Use a <strong>low vanishing point</strong> and experiment with shapes, such as a circular window. Avoid centering the building too much in the frame to keep it interesting. Highlight key features like the circular window to make the building recognizable.</p>

<h2>Shape, Size, and Scale</h2>

<p>Consider <strong>shape, size, scale</strong>, and the relation of shapes to ensure the location is important in the story. Use <strong>extreme three-point perspective</strong> to make the building feel otherworldly. Mix regular elements with the crazy architecture of the sanctum sanctorum.</p>

<h2>Sketching and Planning</h2>

<p>Sketch loosely to plan the composition before making a grid. Ensure all parts are in their proper place in the composition. Use a <strong>10-point divider</strong> for perspective drawing and technical illustration.</p>

<h2>Inking and Adding Detail</h2>

<p>Start inking and adding detail without a ton of purpose initially. Balance detail and shape to make the building look good. Marry reference and personal vision to create a strong image.</p>

<h2>Refining the Image</h2>

<p>Trust your gut and pursue images with potential, even if challenging. Develop a <strong>visual shorthand</strong> to avoid getting bogged down in every detail. Focus on big details like top windows and the shape of the building. Use whiteout to correct and bring out shapes. Avoid perfection; aim for a dynamic and fun image.</p>

<h2>Balancing Story and Visuals</h2>

<p>Allow room for characters to breathe in the story. Balance drawing amazing images with making a good story. Use textured whiteout for trees and other elements.</p>

<h2>Final Touches and Readability</h2>

<p>Prioritize readability before sending the work to a colorist. Erase and refine details to make the image sing. Accept that the process can be messy but aim for personality and visual interest.</p>

<h2>Embracing Challenges</h2>

<p>Dive in headfirst to challenging compositions to improve. Struggle with difficult compositions to get better. Move on to the next lesson or page if frustrated, knowing improvement comes gradually.</p>
