<p>In this lesson, we're going to do two different things. First, you're going to learn some powerful tools and techniques that will allow you to get light and shadow into your gesture drawings. Second, once you have all the tools and techniques you need to draw dynamic and exciting gestures, we're going to take a look at the gesture drawing process as a whole to make sure that you have a solid understanding of the gesture drawing process and that you leave this course with the knowledge, experience, and confidence to produce dynamic and exciting gesture drawings either from life or from photographic reference.</p>

<h2>Simplifying Light and Shadow</h2>

<p>Before we deal with shading something as complex as the human figure, let's first start with a more simple subject. Drawing butternut squashes is a great way to prepare for figure drawing because it shares many of the same shapes and characteristics as the human body. It's the perfect subject to observe as we explore the shading process.</p>

<p>The biggest mistake students make when shading is getting caught up rendering small details and completely missing the big overall lighting scheme that defines the form. Gesture drawing is not about small details; it's about observing and constructing the figure as a dynamic whole. This holds equally true as we apply light and shadow to our gesture drawings.</p>

<p>To start, think about light and shadow in the most simple way possible. Consider your subject as having a lit side and a shadow side. In reality, there are an infinite number of values in between, but focus on the exact moment that the subject turns away from the light and goes into shadow. Simplify and draw the moment when light ends and shadow begins.</p>

<p>Here you can see a simplified version of the line of termination, the line that marks when the light ends. This line does an excellent job simplifying the lighting scheme and dividing the subject into a lit side and a shadow side. It's only after you understand this basic division of light and shadow that you can shade with more detail.</p>

<p>Notice how detailed shadows grow directly out of the original simplified line of termination. When students start shading these kinds of details first, they tend to miss the overall lighting patterns, and the small shading details make little sense. Always understand your shadows in terms of their most simple shapes first before adding complexity.</p>

<p>Underneath the squash, we find the cast shadow. On a simple subject like this, the shadow is cast on the surface that the object is sitting upon. Often, the figure will cast shadows on itself. You should already know that we refer to shadows on the subject itself as form shadows and shadows created when a subject blocks light from hitting an adjacent surface as cast shadows. Cast shadows are darker and harder-edged, while form shadows, although dark, are slightly lighter than cast shadows and have softer edges.</p>

<h2>Applying Light and Shadow to Figures</h2>

<p>When you look at a figure, you should see a clear division between the lit side and the shadow side. Sometimes it's easier to simplify values if you squint your eyes or let your eyes go softly out of focus. The first thing you want to do is be able to see and draw the light and shadow patterns as simply as possible.</p>

<p>Although there's not a single correct solution to this problem, the primary line of termination divides the most prominent shapes and forms of the figure into a lit side and a shadow side. For example, the glute on the left is casting a shadow onto the glute on the right. Follow the line of termination down the left leg.</p>

<p>This line of termination doesn't capture all of the shadows. For example, the shadows on the foot and lower back are not included in this simple line of termination. These shadows are details that only make sense in the context of a larger lighting scheme. In gesture drawing, we're more interested in creating a simple and dynamic sense of light and shadow. Only once the light and shadow patterns are understood simply should we attempt to add more complexity.</p>

<h2>Gesture Drawing Demonstration</h2>

<p>Now, let's pull everything you've learned together into one demonstration drawing. This demonstration drawing was done in under 10 minutes using the exact same tools and techniques that you learned in this course. Note that even though I'm using the same elements, I'm not using them in the same order that you learned them. The tools and techniques are yours to use in whatever way you think is best. Feel free to experiment with them to design your own gesture drawing process.</p>

<p>You'll see me start with a primary action line, simplifying the pose into as few lines as possible. I started with the raised arm on the right, down the side of the torso, and then flipped the line upward to communicate how high the hip is raised and pushed out. From there, I took the line down the outside contour of the leg toward the foot.</p>

<p>Next, I drew a secondary action line capturing the direction of the leg on the right, making sure that the foot on the right is lower than the foot on the left. This should all be done within the first minute of your gesture drawing. Hopefully, you can see how well this simple collection of lines communicates the dynamic pose of the figure.</p>

<p>Then, I drew the axis lines for the shoulders and pelvis. Everything at this point in the drawing is malleable, but the drawing becomes more solid as I add more information. I started to draw the two-chambered shape for the torso, the first closed shape of the drawing. With the torso in place, each new shape needs to be drawn in relationship to it.</p>

<p>I added the suprasternal notch and followed the sternocleidomastoid on the left up and around the shape of the head. With the suprasternal notch in place, I drew other visible indications of the center line of the torso, like the navel and the linea alba traveling out of the navel both above and below it. I indicated the direction of the arm on the left and paid particular attention to the placement of the knees.</p>

<p>Although you won't see much evidence of my measuring in this demonstration drawing, I'm always thinking in terms of measuring. I'm always making visual comparisons between the part of the body I'm drawing and the parts of the body that I've previously drawn. At this point, the figure is starting to solidify. This is roughly where you want your drawing to be within the first three minutes.</p>

<p>Before taking the drawing further or adding more detail, make sure that the general shapes and proportions are working. If there are no major proportional errors, begin the process of building the rest of the figure on top of this simple gesture drawing.</p>

<p>There are some important differences between my drawing and the reference photo. My drawing is more exaggerated. I've made the pose more extreme. The upper torso that I've drawn is tilted more than the upper torso in the photograph. I've also pushed the hip out further to the left, giving my drawing a greater sense of drama and dynamism.</p>

<p>As the drawing takes shape, the lines I'm drawing with are getting darker and sharper, but I'm still saving the darkest lines for later on. Before refining the head, I used my pencil to take a proportional measurement from the reference photo. I learned that the distance from the indention on the left side of the torso to the suprasternal notch is about the same as the distance from the suprasternal notch to the top of the head. So, as I refined the head, I moved the top of it down.</p>

<p>These kinds of adjustments are common and normal, and you should expect to make many of them while doing your gesture drawings. I made a similar adjustment to the arm on the left. I really like the way this drawing is turning out, so I started to add some details to the contours, starting with the weight-bearing leg on the left. I used a strong, dark line to emphasize the curve that occurs when the muscles of the leg flex as they bear the weight of the figure.</p>

<p>Next, I drew the curve of the tibia on the left before adding some detail in the foot. Generally speaking, this is where your drawing should be around the five-minute mark. We have a dynamic statement of the entire pose. Although this doesn't always happen, within the first five minutes, try to include enough information in the drawing that someone could get into the pose just by looking at the drawing itself without seeing the model.</p>

<p>With the entirety of the pose addressed, shift to smaller details. Spend more time crafting the contours of the figure, particularly interested in creating overlaps where the contour for one part of the body comes in front of and overlaps the contour of another part of the body. Overlaps help give the gesture a sense of depth and volume because they tell us which parts of the body are in front and which are behind.</p>

<h2>Shading Process</h2>

<p>Begin the shading process by drawing a simplified line of termination, the line that will divide the lit side of the figure from the shadow side. In this first pass, draw the line of termination with a very light, soft line, and only draw the most prominent direction changes and curvatures of the line of termination. For example, the shadow of the torso casting onto the leg on the right, before continuing down the right side of the leg.</p>

<p>Draw a second line of termination on the leg on the left. Remember, a complex form like the figure may have many different lines of termination on the different parts of the body. Sometimes they connect, and other times they do not. Draw a simplified line of termination for the face. There's no specific order to address these lines of termination, but generally, address the biggest forms of the body first and work your way down to the smaller forms. Simplicity should always come before complexity.</p>

<p>With a simplified line of termination for most of the parts of the body, make a second pass and start to record smaller details. On the second pass, use a soft but darker line than the first pass. This second more detailed pass at the line of termination represents the core shadow, the darker band of shadow that runs down the line of termination before the shadow side gets lighter due to reflected light.</p>

<p>Notice how well this second and more detailed pass at the line of termination describes numerous anatomical details that were left out in the rest of the gesture process. For example, the line of termination now helps describe individual ribs. Using the side of your pencil, lay a light wash of value on the shadow side of the line of termination. Move your pencil back and forth using parallel strokes. By using the side of your pencil, you can make thick, soft lines that appear to unify the shadow side.</p>

<p>Now that the largest and most prominent shadow shapes of the figure are drawn, move around the drawing and refine the lines of termination, adding more and more detail and complexity to the drawing. A well-crafted line of termination has the power to describe all kinds of anatomical features on the surface of the body, even if you don't have a strong sense of the bones and muscles that are creating these shifts in light and shadow.</p>

<h2>Final Touches and Completion</h2>

<p>As the drawing nears completion, think about what it needs to have a sense of completion. This does not mean that all parts of the drawing need to be at an equal level of completion. Leaving parts of a gesture drawing unfinished can add a sense of drama and mystery to the drawing and invites the viewer to help complete the illusion that you've created on the page.</p>

<p>When finishing a drawing, ask yourself what you want to stand out to the viewer. There are three primary ways to emphasize parts of your drawing:</p>

<ul>

<li>Add darker and more refined contours, particularly contours that are drawn quickly and dynamically.</li>

<li>Darken the values, particularly at the line of termination.</li>

<li>Add more detail. Detail draws people in and often distracts viewers from less finished parts of the drawing, leaving them with the impression that the drawing is more finished than it actually is.</li>

</ul>

<p>You can see all three of these emphasis strategies coming together at one of my favorite parts of the body to draw, the knees. Pay particular attention to the knee on the right. Another strategy that gives a sense of completion to a drawing is the grounding of the feet. If you have drawn the head in a gesture drawing, and you don't always do, it's also important to block in the hair. If you have time and you'd like to suggest some facial features, a detailed line of termination will often create a compelling illusion of the face. The trick here is not getting overly detailed. The facial features are implied using value, but they're not stated with any detail using contours.</p>

<p>Remember, one of the goals of gesture drawing is to communicate as much information as you can using as few lines and strokes as possible. This comes with practice. The pose time is nearly over, so take a moment to see if there are any final details you'd like to add. One of the most amazing things about the gesture drawing process is that any new thing you learn, whether it's anatomical or a technique, you can fold it into your gesture process.</p>

<p>For the final touches, draw the shadow that the head is casting over the neck, as well as flesh out the arm on the left a little more. Time is up. This drawing took just under 10 minutes. It'll take a good amount of time and practice for you to be able to accomplish this much in a 10-minute pose, but hopefully, this demonstration has given you a sense of how the gesture drawing process works as a whole, as well as how much can be accomplished in a short amount of time by drawing efficiently and passionately.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p>It's not about drawing fast. It's more about simplifying the figure and focusing on what's essential to the pose instead of getting mired in small details. Ultimately, there are no rules to gesture drawing. Every artist does it differently. In this course, I've tried to introduce you to the elements that most master drawers are using most of the time.</p>

<p>Good gesture drawing is at the foundation of all figure drawing. Underneath every more finished and rendered figure drawing is a dynamic gesture drawing, where the dynamics of the pose were first worked out and the basic forms of the body were drawn as simply as they could be. Gesture drawing is the first and most important step you can take toward learning how to do more complex figure drawings. But gesture drawings can also stand on their own as beautiful works of art. Some of my favorite drawings are gesture drawings that were done in under five minutes.</p>

<p>Gesture drawings can be mysterious and ethereal, or they can have more detail and a greater sense of light and shadow. But what they always share is a sense of beauty and dynamism that only comes from drawing with vitality and vigor.</p>

<p>For today's practice, you'll be drawing from three different practice reels. Each practice reel will contain one 15-minute pose. This is an opportunity to bring together everything you've learned in this course. As you practice today, draw boldly, experiment, have fun, and remember to focus more on your drawing process than the outcome. Good drawing is a byproduct of good process.</p>

<p>I wish you the best of luck with your goals as an artist, and it has sincerely been my pleasure and privilege to have played a role in your process of learning to draw.</p>
