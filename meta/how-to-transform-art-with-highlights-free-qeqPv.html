<h2>What's in Premium?</h2>

<p>In the premium lesson, we dive into adding light and <strong>highlights</strong> to transform your artwork. You'll learn how to organize your layers for the lighting stage, grouping your <strong>shading</strong> layers and <strong>flats</strong>, and creating new layers for highlights. We explore the <strong>transformative</strong> power of highlights, showing how they add <strong>style</strong> and can dramatically change your color palette.</p>

<p>You'll discover how to choose the right highlight color—often a <strong>brighter</strong>, <strong>complementary</strong> hue—and experiment with different intensities to achieve the desired effect. We discuss <strong>balancing highlights and shadows</strong>, depending on your light source and the mood you want to convey.</p>

<p>To keep your workflow efficient, we address avoiding "<strong>hue saturation hell</strong>" by staying true to your original <strong>vision</strong> and setting clear goals. The lesson includes experimenting with different <strong>lighting schemes</strong>, adjusting saturation and hue to shift from cool to warm tones.</p>

<p>We'll also cover adding style with bold highlight colors, enhancing surfaces like <strong>glass</strong> with reflective highlights, and adjusting background elements for <strong>cohesion</strong>. You'll learn about using <strong>texture</strong> and <strong>glow effects</strong> to add depth and interest, and managing your layers effectively with various blending modes.</p>

<p>Finally, we'll revisit shadows to ensure they complement your new lighting scheme, and apply <strong>finishing touches</strong> like coloring within the line art and using tools like the <strong>blur tool</strong> to harmonize all elements of your artwork.</p>
