<h2>Embracing the Stages of Creation</h2>

<p>We're starting right at the beginning, assuming you've got your materials ready. Like Botticelli, who didn't start in one corner and make it up as he went, we work in <strong>stages</strong>. This methodical approach is essential, whether in classical painting or modern illustration.</p>

<h2>My Journey with Advertising Illustration</h2>

<p>For most of my career, I did advertising illustrations, airbrushing rendered products before computers were an option. These projects required careful planning under tight deadlines.</p>

<p>For example, working with Bruce Mayo, who provided wonderful comps, I would:</p>

<ul>

<li>Create an accurate line drawing, sometimes multiple versions.</li>

<li>Get client approval.</li>

<li>Paint the final piece, sometimes overnight.</li>

</ul>

<p>This process was methodical, with <strong>distinct stages</strong>: from rough comps to precise drawings to finished art.</p>

<h2>Developing the Mock Turtle</h2>

<p>When I drew the Mock Turtle from <em>Alice in Wonderland</em>, I started with numerous thumbnail sketches to find a decent design. With honest critiques from my studio friend, I kept refining.</p>

<p>I realized the head's position felt wrong, it needed to tip up more. By analyzing and redrawing the head's center line, I finally got a version I was satisfied with, even if my friend was only mildly impressed.</p>

<h2>Understanding Forms Behind the Scenes</h2>

<p>Drawing a ball with lines around it, <strong>like rubber bands on a sphere</strong>, is one of the most useful forms to master. Bending these "rubber bands" teaches you how to draw anything.</p>

<p>These underlying lines, though they don't appear in the finished piece, are crucial. They come from the perspective skill of knowing how to put a line on a ball, relating to boxes and other forms.</p>

<h2>Letting Spontaneity Take Over</h2>

<p>Not every stage needs to be careful. In fact, <strong>early stages should be un-careful</strong>. The idea is to let spontaneity flow:</p>

<ul>

<li>Pour out ideas without overthinking.</li>

<li>Set time limits to encourage quick thinking.</li>

<li>Generate multiple options, hoping some will come alive.</li>

<li>Then, choose and refine.</li>

</ul>

<p>If a drawing doesn't work, start over with vellum. <strong>Trace over, make another mess, and do it again</strong>. Vellum makes working in stages easier, and while digital tools offer alternatives, I love the tangible feel of paper.</p>

<h2>Balancing Method and Improvisation</h2>

<p>While a separated, staged process is valuable and common among professionals, it can hinder spontaneous drawing. <strong>Spontaneous drawing</strong>, like live improv, sharpens instincts but can be challenging.</p>

<p>If you find it difficult, in our next lesson, I'll show you how filling sketchbooks with drawings can help, and share some lessons about taking risks.</p>
