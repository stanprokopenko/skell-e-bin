<p><strong>This article is my critique and reflection on the ortho to form puzzles project, focusing on the transition from orthographic views to invented forms. I’ll walk through the process, highlight technical and creative challenges, and share feedback on individual submissions.</strong></p>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p><strong>Project Overview</strong></p>

<p>The main goal of this project is to transition from <strong>orthographic (ortho) views to invented forms</strong>. This process is a blend of <strong>technical skill</strong>, like understanding perspective and construction, and <strong>creative skill</strong>, especially when inventing forms that aren’t immediately obvious. I want to emphasize that both the process and the results are <strong>legitimate and valid</strong>. The challenge is real, but it’s meant to push you to grow, not to overwhelm.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p><strong>Critique Process</strong></p>

<p>I start by scrolling through all the submissions, getting a sense of the overall work. I look for the <strong>distinction between orthos and inventions</strong> - how well you move from a flat, technical view to a creative, three-dimensional form. The intent is to <strong>challenge and enliven</strong>, not to make things impossible. If you find it tough, that's by design, but I'm here to support you.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p><strong>Technical Considerations</strong></p>

<p>A few technical points came up repeatedly:</p>

<ul>

<li>

<p><strong>Vanishing Points and Isometric Angles:</strong><br />

Some of you tried to work without vanishing points at first, but found it much easier once you included them. Using isometric angles is not cheating, it’s a valid approach, and I encourage you to try both methods.</p>

</li>

<li>

<p><strong>Drawing Cubes with Quantifiable Measurements:</strong><br />

    If your forms don’t look like cubes, one solution is to draw a lot of boxes until you get better. But I’ll also show you how to draw a cube with precise, measurable steps, as in architectural practice.</p>

</li>

<li>

<p><strong>Construction Lines (“Thin Wires”):</strong><br />

    Without constructing a box and using thin wires or guidelines, it’s almost impossible to accurately place forms in space. These lines are essential, especially when objects are floating or overlapping.</p>

</li>

<li>

<p><strong>Inconsistent Isometric Angles:</strong><br />

    If you’re inconsistent with your angles, especially when forms are meant to swivel, you’ll run into problems. Consistency is key for believable forms.</p>

</li>

</ul>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p><strong>Community Support and Feedback</strong></p>

<p>The community played a big role in clarifying concepts. <strong>Lynn (Lynn3)</strong>, in particular, provided clear explanations and support. In isometric perspective, without construction lines, you can't determine the position of objects. Lynn acted as a professional teacher, and the students responded as pre-professionals, learning from the feedback. I believe in <strong>tough love</strong>. I’ll push you, but always to help you grow.</p>

<p><strong>Individual Student Feedback</strong></p>

<p><strong>Andreas</strong><br />

Andreas made inventive use of slopes and curves that can’t be predicted from a single view. Some curves are only visible from certain angles, but Andreas made them work within the constraints. He submitted part one early to ask for help, first trying the project without vanishing points (which didn’t work), then improving after using them. The forms still didn’t look like cubes, but the effort and learning were clear.</p>

<p><strong>Jay Minriv</strong><br />

Jay Minriv experimented with positive and negative forms, creating multiple variations and exploring simple extrusions. He played with counter-changing shapes, and even if the castle design was based on a real one, the extrusion and graphic design were strong. I’m impressed by the creativity and execution.</p>

<p><strong>CETA and Dave</strong><br />

CETA and Dave created monumentally tall forms, pushing past the constraint of matching the height to the plan view. There’s no rule against making the top view extend upward, and CETA dared to do so, which I appreciate.</p>

<p><strong>Rick B</strong><br />

Rick B took an innovative approach to the top view, introducing negative space and imagining forms floating above one another. Swapping out negative and positive spaces shows strong imagination. The use of thin wires to account for gaps was effective. Rick B produced two sets of forms, both exemplary.</p>

<p><strong>Vera Robson</strong><br />

Vera Robson was the most inventive, sticking to a flat plus sign but tilting forms at a 30-degree angle and aligning edges and corners in unexpected ways. She also transformed rectangles into cylinders, which I anticipated but still found inventive. Vera challenged the assumption of right angles in a creative way.</p>

<p><strong>Maria Biro</strong><br />

Maria Biro expressed a love for brain puzzles, which is exactly the right attitude for this kind of project.</p>

<p><strong>Josh Drummond</strong><br />

Josh Drummond used wide-angle perspective and applied lessons from previous projects, like the “melted pancakes” assignment. He showed an understanding of how forms near the viewer are seen from above and how they conform to the horizon line as they recede.</p>

<p><strong>JPC99</strong><br />

JPC99 worked on newsprint, preferring to work large, but had to clean up images in Photoshop due to scanning issues. He freehanded lines and forms, understanding horizon lines and vanishing points, but tried to visualize them without a ruler. While this can be seen as lazy, if it leads to improvement, it’s a valid approach.</p>

<p><strong>Jay Oshie</strong><br />

Jay Oshie completed the project freehand, achieving both creative and technical success.</p>

<p><strong>Key Lessons Learned</strong></p>

<ul>

<li>

<p><strong>Account for Every Line:</strong><br />

    Learn from students who made sure every line was accurate and accounted for.</p>

</li>

<li>

<p><strong>Value Creative Risks:</strong><br />

    There’s also a lot to learn from those who surprised us with daring and creative choices.</p>

</li>

<li>

<p><strong>Balance Skill and Creativity:</strong><br />

    This project, like previous assignments, is not about trigonometry, but it is scientific and requires accountability in connecting precise lines.</p>

</li>

</ul>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p><strong>Encouragement and Next Steps</strong></p>

<p>I encourage everyone to review the work of others for further learning. The next lesson will focus on being more meticulous, tracking things carefully, and making good connections. The upcoming critique will address these topics in more detail. Keep pushing yourself, and remember that both technical precision and creative surprises are valuable.</p>
