<h2>Projecting the Ground Plan</h2>

<p>We have a more complex ground plan that we'll turn into elevations. The first thing I do is <strong>project the plan</strong>. I've placed it so that only one corner touches the surface. That's the only true height line we'll have for this entire object.</p>

<p>This means the height lines for these boxes won't be traceable from there. We'll have to bring them forward to make them touch. The height line for this point of the roof is clear and unforeshortened. The height lines for other points of the roof will have to be brought forward as well.</p>

<h2>Placing the Viewer and Vanishing Points</h2>

<p>I'll put the <strong>viewer</strong> back here, placing them right there. This means this is almost a perfect two-point perspective. Our 60-degree cone of vision should include it all, it is very close. It's going to be a <strong>wide-angle view</strong>.</p>

<p>Now, we want to place our <strong>vanishing points</strong>. I make sure those vanishing points are going to be in the picture. Here's what I do:</p>

<ul>

<li>I place the straightedge and the triangle and go to the point where the viewer is.</li>

<li>From there over to here is the right vanishing point.</li>

<li>Aligning with the angles of our viewer, I find the left vanishing point.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Projecting Points to the Viewer</h2>

<p>The next job is to take every one of those corners, this one, this one, and so on, and bring them down to the viewer. I make a single dot where the viewer is. If possible, I could put a push pin there, which would make it very exact.</p>

<p>I run lines from each corner to the viewer. This is important. I'm bringing down:</p>

<ul>

<li>Each corner that can be called corners.</li>

<li>Points where portions of the building touch each other.</li>

</ul>

<p>These lines converge at the viewer, helping us project the plan onto the picture plane.</p>

<h2>Dropping Vertical Lines from the Picture Plane</h2>

<p>Now, we no longer need the viewer. The viewer has established where all these intersections are. The next step is to take the picture plane and pivot it down. This means all these points will now become <strong>vertical lines</strong> on which we will place height measurements.</p>

<p>I make these vertical lines as thin and unobtrusive as possible. Every one of these lines needs to be precise, they need to touch the dots they're supposed to touch. They may not make sense right now because they're just a bunch of vertical lines, but they will make sense when we're trying to find where a corner may be. We run them down from where the points touch the picture plane.</p>

<h2>Establishing the Perspective Grid</h2>

<p>Starting with the corner that touches the picture plane, I track it down and decide how low I want it to be on the ground. If we get it too low, it becomes well out of the cone of vision.</p>

<p>We're creating a wide-angle view. In fact, I'm making it even a little wider angle. There's a reason, I don't want it to encroach up here. We're conjuring something, we're conjuring up an animal that we don't know how big it's going to be.</p>

<p>Now, I take all those lines, we dropped them down, and now we're going to put them into perspective.</p>

<p>Since that front corner is there, it goes back to the <strong>left vanishing point</strong> at an angle like this. Where does it end? The ground part of it will end right there. That is the part that touches the ground.</p>

<p>Remember, it's important to be precise with these lines. Mistakes can compound, but I correct them as I go.</p>

<p>The next ones are just connecting the dots. If we've done our job right, the points will align correctly when we point them to their respective vanishing points.</p>

<h2>Transferring the Heights and Elevations</h2>

<p>Now it's time to <strong>transfer the heights</strong>. We need to measure how high anything is, say, the height of different parts of the house.</p>

<p>There's only one corner that touches the picture plane, which means when we bring it down here, I'm going to darken this line because that's going to be the only non-foreshortened line. The heavy line is the line that we're going to use to take all measurements.</p>

<p>I line up the T-square and pull it tight so that it goes right there. I place the base of this house so it just rests perfectly on that line and burnish it down.</p>

<p>Now, we can transfer the heights from our elevations onto the drawing.</p>

<h3>Using Reference Points</h3>

<p>We know that the highest point is the peak of the roof. We also have points we're sure of, such as this point right here, and we know where it is not only top to bottom but left to right. It is perfectly there. We should make that a <strong>prime reference point</strong>.</p>

<p>We need the height of the peak of the small roof and the base of the small roof. The height of these elements is important.</p>

<p>Once we have that height established, we run it back to the left vanishing point. This gives us, with a few connect-the-dots moments, the correct placement on the drawing.</p>

<p>We repeat this process for other elements, using the right vanishing point where appropriate. It's an elaborate but fun process of connecting the dots.</p>

<p>Once we have a basic measurement, we'll find all the other ones.</p>

<h2>Finalizing the Drawing</h2>

<p>Now, let's take the peak of the roof, because we know where that is. It's established and certain. I want to draw it lightly because most of the line will be gone, although this portion will be dark, and that can go down heavily.</p>

<p>We can now connect the dots to form the roof. We know that certain lines go off to their respective vanishing points, so we can draw them accordingly.</p>

<h3>Eyeballing Measurements</h3>

<p>Sometimes, I might <strong>eyeball a measurement</strong> if I didn't get it quite as accurate as I wanted to in the initial setup. With experience and skill, I trust that I'm giving you something not too far off.</p>

<p>We can throw in another vertical line that we know is there. It's going to intersect with that corner back behind there.</p>

<p>We're trying to darken in the lines that would be darkened lines, <strong>primary lines</strong>. The ones at the base here. I know that's at the base, it's the same height, so I don't want to run it the way we had it for the shadow. I want to run it through the base of those elements.</p>

<h3>Adding Details</h3>

<p>Let me add the <strong>door</strong>. I'm going to estimate this door, I can see the distance between certain points, and that's about twice that distance.</p>

<p>How about the height of that door? We'll figure the height, run it back to the vanishing point, and it will intersect with the guessed width of the door in that position.</p>

<p>It may look tall and skinny, but that's due to the wide-angle lens effect contributing to this tall and skinny quality.</p>

<h2>Completing the Drawing</h2>

<p>I think, because it's fun, we'll <strong>darken everything in with a heavier pencil</strong>, but only the primary lines, though. Maybe before we do them all, we should lighten up some of the lines that should be lightened up.</p>

<p>That looks pretty good, maybe a little more for the ground.</p>

<p><strong>Alright, I think we've done it.</strong> We've made a plan projection of a wide-angle, three-quarter view of a house.</p>

<p><strong>Go and do thou likewise.</strong></p>
