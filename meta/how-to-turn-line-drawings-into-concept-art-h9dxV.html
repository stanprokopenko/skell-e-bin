<h2>Setting Up the Composition</h2>

<p>I decided to illustrate how to apply lighting and color to a simple concept design. I drew a very simple geometric composition of a mountain landscape with three layers:</p>

<ul>

<li>A <strong>foreground</strong> hill with a little character walking along a path.</li>

<li>A <strong>mid-ground</strong> with some sort of castle structure.</li>

<li>A <strong>background</strong> with mountains into the distance.</li>

</ul>

<p>This setup allows us to have depth and layering compositionally. I split the image into four main blocks: the sky, the mountains, the mid-ground, and the foreground.</p>

<h2>Starting with Ambient Light</h2>

<p>When I start painting, I like to think about <strong>ambient light</strong> first. I imagine a bluish, cloudy day with light coming from everywhere. I begin very rough, focusing on the impression rather than details. As I refine it a bit more, I hide the line art to focus on developing the layers without relying on outlines. The goal is to achieve believable lighting and color without the need for line art, as there are no outlines in real life.</p>

<p>I then split the composition into distinct layers, locking each one for easier painting:</p>

<ul>

<li>The sky</li>

<li>The distant mountains</li>

<li>The mid-ground castle</li>

<li>The foreground hill and character</li>

</ul>

<p>I created a <strong>sharp selection set</strong> for each layer, allowing me to work on them individually.</p>

<h2>Adding Ambient Occlusion</h2>

<p>Next, I made an <strong>ambient occlusion pass</strong>. I painted in value into each layer to represent the soft shadows that occur in ambient light. I'm envisioning a gray day, so I'm not thinking about the local color of the objects yet. In this case, everything is gray, focusing on a <strong>light-centric approach</strong>.</p>

<p>Now, I have all the layers split into the composition's blocks, each with some soft light. The ambient occlusion helps me see the form, and the distinct edges allow me to see the shapes of each object.</p>

<h2>Exploring Local Color</h2>

<p>Then, I considered the <strong>local color</strong> of the objects. Still imagining the generic bluish-gray light, I adjusted the colors slightly:</p>

<ul>

<li>The grass in the foreground</li>

<li>The stone of the castle walls and the different materials on top</li>

<li>Some snow on the distant mountains</li>

</ul>

<p>Using this as a starting place, I'm still not aiming for fully refined art here. I'm exploring the lighting, so they can remain as very loose sketches. Not everything is perfectly refined, but it gives me a foundation to work from.</p>

<p>At this point, even in the local color version under this terrible blue-gray light, I can still see depth, shape, and form. The ambient occlusion helps define the form, and the distinct edges show the shapes of each object.</p>

<h2>Exploring Different Lighting Scenarios</h2>

<p>Now, I wanted to explore how different lighting conditions can affect the composition. I'll show you how I adjust the lighting to create various moods and focal points in the scene.</p>

<h3>Misty Morning</h3>

<p>The first scenario I thought of is a <strong>misty morning</strong>, since we're already in that gray zone. I changed the sky from a flat color to a more gray look and painted in some soft cloud-like structures to suggest darkness and soft clouds.</p>

<p>I added a new layer in <strong>Linear Dodge (Add)</strong> mode and painted in some soft extra layering, like there's mist down in the valley. I played with the contrast of the foreground hill to make it even darker, and I did a <strong>Hue/Saturation adjustment</strong> to desaturate the colors slightly, taking some of the greens out to make it look more muted and misty.</p>

<p>I added another fog layer with floating misty layers of clouds, hovering between the layers to give the feeling of elevation. It also provides more separation between the castle and the mountain behind it.</p>

<p>On the foreground, I decided to add little lights to the castle. The time of day is either early in the morning, after the sun has set, or there's a really big storm. Those little lights add some color contrast to draw the eye to the castle as a focal point.</p>

<h3>Dense Fog</h3>

<p>Next, I wanted another version: misty, but with <strong>full fog</strong>. Instead of high clouds with low mist, I wanted something with <strong>even denser fog</strong>.</p>

<p>I adjusted the background colors, making them really brighter to give even more depth and separation. I lightened the background significantly and made the sky a flat color, filling the whole scene with mist in the air.</p>

<p>I made a copy of the background mountains and blurred them slightly by a few pixels. This blur pushes the mountain back as if there's particulate in the air diffusing it. It doesn't draw the eye there anymore.</p>

<p>I added more fog layers and did the same for the mid-ground mountains, slightly blurring them as if particles are diffusing the air. Then, I added more fog between the layers.</p>

<p>I created a fog layer that's really strong, painting over in <strong>Normal</strong> mode with color to create thick, patchy fog rolling in. I wanted there to be some patchiness so that the castle feels farther back than the immediate foreground.</p>

<p>This gives even more depth, with just a little bit of contrast on the castle. Now, the focal point of the shot is definitely the character, because the highest contrast is right there on the character looking over the misty scene.</p>

<p>I added a slight blue lift to the foreground to add some fog, painting fog over the foreground to make it feel like the mist is rolling in there. This further focuses the focal point.</p>

<p>I decided to add the window lights back in and blurred them as well to give the effect that they are softly affecting the atmosphere.</p>

<p>Comparing this version to the previous misty morning, they both have a different feeling and focus. The dense fog creates a different mood.</p>

<h3>High Key Morning Sunrise</h3>

<p>I wanted to create a <strong>morning shot</strong> with high key, lots of bright light, a happy morning. The previous versions were dark and mysterious, so I wanted to change the mood.</p>

<p>I found a piece of reference of a morning sunrise and used that. I liked how the sunlight diffused through the air. I painted the sky with some of the colors from the photograph, incorporating blues, oranges, and yellows.</p>

<p>Then, I painted each layer with the idea of light coming from screen left. I painted the bright light on one side and the dark on the other, giving good form to the mountains. The light is very soft, so I don't have hard shadows. Instead, I have soft shadows.</p>

<p>I'm also wrapping the light around the surfaces and intentionally changing my colors to show how the light would bend around the objects. I chose a color palette that is hopefully very appealing, with limited soft pastel colors.</p>

<p>I added a layer of glow over the top that supports the idea of very high key, soft, beautiful morning light. This creates a different look, shifting the mood to a brighter, happier scene.</p>

<h3>Midday Sun with Focal Light</h3>

<p>I thought about creating a look where not everything is being hit by the sun. I still wanted a midday shot but with a <strong>pool of light</strong>.</p>

<p>Instead of having everything lit, I wanted some clouds to justify a beam of light that's just coming onto the castle. I painted some clouds in the sky and added the sunlight only onto the castle. I didn't let the sunlight hit the background mountains or the foreground character, creating a very strong focal point.</p>

<p>I changed my colors slightly so that the lighted area stands out while the rest falls off into shadow. Then, I added some fog layers to give extra separation and make the castle pop off the background.</p>

<p>Without the fog, the character blends into the background, so I needed more separation. I added extra fog to create a very saturated color palette, with some cyans in the fog to complement the warm yellow-greens. This gives it a different color opinion.</p>

<p>In the foreground, I painted a little bit of light, as if light is bouncing off the hill and towards the character. I made another layer with a little bit of soft light coming towards the character. Then, I added a <strong>bloom layer</strong> over the top that lets the light glow through the atmosphere and fog into the camera.</p>

<p>This is a different kind of happy, different from the high key sunrise. There's a different level of contrast overall in the shot, but it still feels like a place where you'd want to go, a happy place.</p>

<h3>Midday Sun from Screen Right</h3>

<p>Next, I wanted a <strong>midday sun</strong> scenario with the sun coming from screen right. I found a reference image where the lighting was like this, changing the shape of the buildings and the light in the scene.</p>

<p>I added a fog layer to give a little separation and added extra <strong>bounce light</strong>. The light is coming in and bouncing off of the character's red cloak back onto the rocks and bouncing from the rocks onto themselves.</p>

<p>I didn't let the sunlight go all the way down because I wanted there to be a right-screen-centric focus. Now, there's kind of a two-focused approach, and this rendering is a bit more graphic in style, but it follows the same composition.</p>

<p>I wanted the attention to be drawn to the door of the castle, so I'm considering all the different pieces of the light. I added a little cyan highlight from the left. Again, I'm thinking about shape, I want to see the roundness of the tops of the roofs, so a little <strong>specular highlight</strong> of a different color, as opposed to the warm light, helps me see the shape better.</p>

<p>Then, I added some glow to the sky, as if the sun is up, shining down and there's a little bit of haze taking some of the crunchiness of the contrast out and softening the whole image.</p>

<h3>Sunset</h3>

<p>I did another version, a <strong>sunset</strong>. You can see a little bit more of my process in this one. I started by darkening the whole image, and painted some really dark clouds into the sky.</p>

<p>I added some haze and did a <strong>curves adjustment</strong> to turn the whole scene a little more purple. I placed the sun right behind the castle and added some glow to the sun. I also added some overall glow to the scene. This is right as the sun is setting.</p>

<p>I added some little extra specular highlights to capture the sun's highlights on the rocks and on the edge of the character. I added little highlights onto the castle and made some paint touch-ups to give more complexity to the clouds.</p>

<p>I turned on the window lights, which make it look like it's a high-contrast sunset. This is still a rough painting, I'd need to do a lot of cleanup to turn this into a final illustration, but it gives me an idea of what the scene could look like if the sun were low in the sky.</p>

<h3>Nighttime</h3>

<p>Lastly, I wanted to create a <strong>nighttime</strong> version. I started by darkening the entire image and painted some dark clouds into the sky.</p>

<p>I added low clouds, fog layers to split the layers, and more fog to really separate the castle from the background. Another fog layer separates the foreground character from the castle. I added more chunky fog, changing my brush to have a bit more grit to it, creating a night atmosphere.</p>

<p>I turned on the window lights and added glow from those windows, indicating there's atmosphere and haze. I wanted some <strong>bounce light</strong> coming from those lights, since the camera is exposed for night, those windows' light will spread further. This way, I can have some little highlights onto the castle to mimic the idea that there's more light than you would see under a brighter lighting setup.</p>

<p>On the character, I thought it would be great if the staff had some magic in it. I wanted to draw more attention to the character, so I added some glow and more glow of that light onto the surrounding set, making the staff really bright. This definitely makes the focal point the magic person coming into the castle.</p>

<p>I added some little sparkle layers onto the staff and thought maybe this isn't enough, so what if I put a moon in the scene? I took a photo I had of the moon and pasted it in, setting it to <strong>Add</strong> mode. Then, I added a warm glow on top of the moon.</p>

<p>Even though most people think of moonlight as being blue, actual moonlight is very yellow. There's a thing called the <strong>Purkinje effect</strong> that affects your eye's perception with the rods and cones. Your night vision cannot see reds as much as blues and greens. Really, blue is the main color you see at night. You can only see the warmth of the moon when you look at it directly.</p>

<p>I painted in a little bit of warmth onto the clouds to rim light them, added a layer of a few stars, and then added direct moonlight. This moonlight is now forming a rim onto the tops of the towers, and the edges of the mountains. Again, separation, shape, and form, the rim light helps me see the shape and form.</p>

<p>I added a little bit of paint touch-up, adding more detail into the clouds. Then, I added a little bit more fog to soften the night. I also wanted a little more glow in the fog, which gives me the final look.</p>

<h2>Comparing the Different Lighting Scenarios</h2>

<p>Looking at all of these versions, you can see I don't need the line art to make this work. These should all work without it:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Nighttime</strong></li>

<li><strong>Sunset</strong></li>

<li><strong>Midday Sun from Screen Right</strong></li>

<li><strong>Midday Sun with Focal Light</strong></li>

<li><strong>High Key Morning Sunrise</strong></li>

<li><strong>Super Thick Mist</strong></li>

<li><strong>Very Thin Mist</strong></li>

<li><strong>Plain Local Color</strong></li>

</ul>

<p>Each version has a different feeling, focus, and mood, demonstrating how lighting and color can dramatically change a scene.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p>This is my process for thinking about how to apply lighting and color to a simple line drawing and exploring what light and color can do. By adjusting the lighting conditions, colors, and atmospheric effects, we can create vastly different moods and focal points within the same basic composition.</p>
