<h2>Simplifying Gesture and Structure</h2>

<p>In figure drawing, I like to simplify <strong>gesture</strong> and <strong>structure</strong> into two basic elements: <strong>curves</strong> and <strong>corners</strong>. By thinking of it this way, we can approach drawing more intuitively and creatively, rather than theoretically.</p>

<h2>Understanding Structure: The Importance of Corners</h2>

<p><strong>Structure</strong> is about creating a sense of form and position in space. The more <strong>corners</strong> we include in our drawing, the more we convey the <strong>three-dimensionality</strong> and <strong>position</strong> of the form.</p>

<p>For example, a perfect sphere may have volume, but without corners, it's hard to tell its exact position in space, whether we're viewing it from slightly underneath or to the side. <strong>Corners provide visual cues</strong> that help the viewer understand the object's placement.</p>

<h2>Understanding Gesture: The Flow of Curves</h2>

<p><strong>Gesture</strong> is about capturing the <strong>life</strong> and <strong>fluid energy</strong> of the form. It's the use of <strong>long axis curves</strong> that connect one form to the next. By emphasizing curves, we bring movement and dynamism into our drawings.</p>

<p>We can think of gesture as the <strong>long axis</strong> that flows through the form, while the <strong>short axis</strong> moves over the form, helping us feel its volume.</p>

<h2>Applying Curves and Corners in Figure Drawing</h2>

<p>Let's apply these ideas to figure drawing. I start by drawing the <strong>long axis curve</strong> of the face, without focusing on the features or details. It's about capturing the overall flow.</p>

<p>Then, I build enough <strong>structure</strong>, adding corners where necessary, to find the next gesture. For instance, I might draw the <strong>shoulder line</strong> using a long axis curve, and connect it to the previous form.</p>

<p>When connecting different body parts, I use <strong>corners</strong> to indicate where one form ends and another begins. <strong>Overshooting lines</strong> and <strong>crisscrossing them</strong> creates these corners, which add structure and position.</p>

<h2>Connecting Forms Through Gesture and Structure</h2>

<p>I think of the <strong>gesture lines</strong> as flowing through the figure, connecting forms even when they're interrupted or hidden. For example, the neck connects to the rib cage, and I imagine the flow continuing through the shoulder girdle.</p>

<p>By considering what's happening on the unseen side of the form, I can create a stronger sense of volume and connectivity. <strong>Drawing through the form</strong> helps to suggest the parts we can't see, enhancing the three-dimensional illusion.</p>

<h2>Overlapping and Drawing Through Forms</h2>

<p>As I draw, I look for multiple ways to connect different parts of the figure. For instance, I might connect the neck to the breastbone, to the shoulder line, and to the back of the rib cage. <strong>Triple-checking</strong> these connections helps ensure that each part is placed correctly.</p>

<p>I also consider the overlapping of forms. Even though we only see one side of an object, showing how forms overlap or connect through other forms gives a better sense of depth and volume.</p>

<h2>Prioritizing Gesture When Time is Limited</h2>

<p>If I'm short on time, such as when the model is changing poses quickly, I prioritize capturing the <strong>gesture</strong> over building detailed structure. I'll indicate the movement and flow of the limbs with long axis curves, even if I don't have time to add the hands or other details.</p>

<p>The <strong>gesture is more important than the structure</strong>, because it conveys the energy and life of the figure. Structure can be added later if time allows.</p>

<h2>The Mastery of Connective Strategy</h2>

<p>The real mastery in art comes from the <strong>connective strategy</strong>, showing how separate parts come together. It's not just about drawing individual parts accurately, but about how they relate and link to each other.</p>

<p>Drawing is like music, hitting individual notes isn't enough. It's the way the notes are connected to create melody, that makes it art. Similarly, in drawing, the <strong>connectivity</strong> between forms brings the figure to life.</p>

<h2>Focusing on One Problem at a Time</h2>

<p>When practicing, I focus on solving <strong>one problem at a time</strong>. For instance, I might work on connecting the hip to the leg and not worry about proportions initially. If the proportions are off, I'll adjust them later.</p>

<p>I believe in <strong>chunking down</strong> problems and not being too hard on myself. By working on specific issues individually, I can improve more effectively without becoming overwhelmed.</p>

<h2>Keeping Consistent Thinking Throughout the Drawing Process</h2>

<p>Whether I'm working on a simple line drawing or a detailed rendering, I keep the same thought process. I continue to think about <strong>gesture and structure</strong>, using curves and corners to build the figure.</p>

<p>This consistent approach allows me to apply these concepts regardless of the medium, whether it's charcoal, oil paint, or clay sculpture. My thinking remains focused on what's most important at each stage, first the gesture and structure, then proportions, and then the shadow shapes.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p>In rendering, I carry through the same ideas of using <strong>long axis curves</strong> for gesture and adding <strong>corners</strong> for structure. Whether I'm working on a finished piece or a quick sketch, these principles guide my process.</p>

<p>By simplifying gesture and structure into curves and corners, and by focusing on how forms connect, I can create drawings that not only capture the appearance of the figure but also convey its energy and life.</p>
