<h2>Initial Sketch and Lay-In</h2>

<p>I began my final painting for the lips chapter with a <strong>light gesture and lay-in</strong>. Starting with an <strong>ovoid shape for the denture sphere</strong>, I <strong>lightly roughed in the lip line</strong>, focusing on the tilt to ensure accuracy. Establishing the <strong>center line</strong> and the <strong>cupid's bow</strong> was crucial at this stage.</p>

<p>Next, I <strong>defined the lower lip shape</strong> and indicated the <strong>receding plane under the lower lip</strong> that feeds into the top of the chin. I blocked out the <strong>philtrum above the upper lip</strong>, noting how it connects to the <strong>septum of the nose</strong>. Ensuring all facial features lined up symmetrically was important, so I paid attention to parallel alignment.</p>

<p>I lightly indicated the <strong>nasal labial folds</strong> and outlined the <strong>chin</strong>. After punching in the <strong>dark accents in the corners of the mouth</strong>, I went over the initial sketch with darker lines for added confidence.</p>

<h2>Building Up Layers in Photoshop</h2>

<p>I flattened the drawing layers and <strong>labeled the line layer</strong>. To eliminate the intimidating white background, I created a <strong>quick color wash</strong> layer underneath, using <strong>cad reds and oranges</strong>. This wash serves as a base that matches flesh tones and allows for subsurface scattering.</p>

<p>I then <strong>colorized the line layer</strong> using <code>Ctrl + U</code> (hue/saturation), checked <strong>Colorize</strong>, and adjusted the saturation and lightness to achieve a <strong>burnt sienna</strong> hue. This gives the lines a warm tone that blends well with the skin colors.</p>

<h2>Adding Local Colors</h2>

<p>On a new layer between the wash and the line, I began filling in the <strong>local colors</strong> with flat shapes. Using a <strong>squared textured brush</strong>, I chose midtone colors for the skin and lips. My wife's lips are naturally <strong>darker and redder</strong>, so I selected a suitable hue for them.</p>

<p>I filled in the <strong>skin</strong>, <strong>lips</strong>, and <strong>nostrils</strong>, keeping it graphic and not worrying about gradients or details at this point. I also added a <strong>neutral background color</strong> for contrast.</p>

<h2>Separating Lights and Darks</h2>

<p>Next, I created a layer to <strong>separate lights and darks</strong> using <strong>graphic flat shapes</strong>. I chose a color slightly warmer and more saturated than the skin tone for the <strong>shadow shapes</strong>. I carefully designed and simplified the lights and darks, generalizing shadowed areas even if they appeared lighter in the reference.</p>

<p>This exercise helps in <strong>designing the shapes</strong> and <strong>simplifying the values</strong>, which is essential for creating a strong foundation.</p>

<h2>Adding Dark Accents and Highlights</h2>

<p>On a new layer, I added <strong>dark accents</strong> using <strong>warmer dark reds</strong> to enhance areas of occlusion without resorting to black, which can flatten the image. I then created a layer for <strong>highlights</strong>, using <strong>cooler colors in the pinks</strong>, and kept them graphic. Simplifying numerous small highlights into larger, more manageable shapes helps in maintaining clarity.</p>

<p>Between the highlights and dark accents, I added <strong>mid-tone areas</strong>, increasing the value and saturation slightly to bridge the gap between lights and shadows.</p>

<h2>Blending and Refining</h2>

<p>I flattened all the layers and began <strong>blending</strong> using the <strong>blender brush</strong>. This step softens the edges and unifies the painting. I focused on <strong>separating the shapes in the lips</strong>, adjusting values, and refining edges. Using the <strong>polygonal lasso tool</strong>, I added smaller highlights, aiming for variation in shape and size.</p>

<p>I balanced <strong>pushing and pulling</strong> the warms and cools to enhance depth and volume. <strong>Experimentation</strong> at this stage is key to achieving a pleasing result.</p>

<h2>Final Touches and Review</h2>

<p>I continued to <strong>refine the painting</strong>, adjusting the <strong>nose shape</strong>, <strong>chin</strong>, and <strong>secondary light sources</strong> in the shadow areas. After final adjustments, I reviewed the <strong>anatomy of the lips</strong>:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Cupid's bow</strong></li>

<li><strong>Corners of the mouth</strong> with dark accents</li>

<li><strong>Middle and flanking tubercles</strong></li>

<li><strong>Two tubercles on the bottom lip</strong></li>

<li><strong>Hard edge at the base of the lip</strong> and the <strong>recessed plane under the lower lip</strong></li>

<li><strong>Philtrum</strong> connecting to the <strong>septum of the nose</strong></li>

</ul>

<p>Remember, the mouth is <strong>rounded</strong>, and the lip line is like a <strong>flattened version of the cupid's bow</strong>. </p>

<p>By focusing on these elements and following a structured approach, I've achieved a harmonious balance of <strong>warms and cools</strong>, enhancing the depth and realism of the lips. This method ensures that the painting conveys the volume and subtlety of the mouth's anatomy.</p>
