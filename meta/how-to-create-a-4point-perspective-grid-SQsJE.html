<h2>Why a Four-Point Down Shot?</h2>

<p>I like using a <strong>four-point perspective</strong> grid for dramatic, wide-angle down shots. It gives me a <strong>curvilinear view</strong> of the horizon, which is especially helpful if I’m drawing a scene from a high vantage point looking down. It also frees me from always depending on a flat, two-point or three-point setup. Once I have the grid, I can move my camera around and place buildings or objects across a wide cityscape without distortion.</p>

<h2>Step 1: Drawing the High Horizon</h2>

<p>First, I place the <strong>horizon line</strong> high on my canvas because I’m looking down. I put one vanishing point on the far left and one on the far right. Then I find a <strong>middle area</strong> on the horizon where I eyeball a line going straight down. This middle line will help with the vertical tilt of the shot.</p>

<h2>Step 2: Setting Up Curved Lines</h2>

<p>To capture that curvilinear effect, I:

1. Draw a straight line across my canvas on a separate layer.

2. Use Photoshop’s Warp tool to curve it. I make a Loose marquee selection around that line, choose Transform, then Warp, and gently pull the middle or edges down or up until I have the curve I want.

3. Position it so it converges toward the vanishing points on the horizon.</p>

<h3>Why Warp?</h3>

<p>Warping helps me <strong>create smooth, precise curves</strong> that match the perspective flow, no matter how wide I want the shot to be. Instead of freehanding the arc, I can keep copying this warped line, transforming and adjusting it to align with the points on the horizon.</p>

<h2>Step 3: Copying and Pasting</h2>

<p>When I have one curved line set, I copy, paste, and warp it again for the next line. I keep duplicating that same layer, transforming it so each <strong>curved line</strong> moves farther toward or away from the horizon. Flatten them when you have enough. This step is quick and ensures all those curves match the same perspective rule.</p>

<h2>The Importance of Creating Your Own Grids</h2>

<p>I don’t rely on premade grids in software, because it becomes a crutch. I’ve seen artists in professional settings asked to draw a scene from a new angle, only to panic when the built-in grids were removed. Knowing how to build perspective grids is a huge advantage. It shows employers you’re flexible enough to handle any camera view, especially more advanced angles like this four-point down shot.</p>

<h2>Adding More Lines with a Flexible Ruler</h2>

<p>I like using a <strong>bendable Westcott ruler</strong> to add lines back to those vanishing points. It’s see-through, and I can curve it to follow my warped grid. As I draw more lines, I train my arm to match the perspective angles. The more often I do this, the easier it gets to recall those angles without needing a ruler at all.</p>

<h2>Working with Measuring Lines</h2>

<p>Sometimes you need to place buildings at new angles. That’s where <strong>measuring lines</strong> shine:<br />

- I draw a short line at the bottom of my canvas and mark out angles that match the building edges above.<br />

- This “pistol” approach, aiming each angle, is faster than having one long line cluttering my drawing.

- I can copy and paste these measuring lines to the other side, then flip them to get symmetrical angles.</p>

<h2>Building Up the Scene</h2>

<p>Once the grid is in place, I start with basic <strong>cube shapes</strong> for buildings, plotting them with the warped lines. I keep an eye on scale: buildings closer to me are bigger than those in the distance. I trace each edge to a vanishing point, adjusting the roof lines and edges so they follow the curve of the perspective.</p>

<h3>Overlap for Depth</h3>

<p>Overlapping buildings and streets adds <strong>instant depth</strong>. If a building in the foreground overlaps another behind it, the sense of space increases. I use <strong>large, medium, and small</strong> shapes to vary the skyline. Overlap also ensures I don’t end up with a flat, repetitive layout.</p>

<h2>Finishing Touches</h2>

<p>I don’t need to draw every detail all the way to the horizon. In many environments, <strong>farmland, trees, or hills</strong> occupy the background. I’ll often sketch a tree line or hillside where I want the scene to fade out. This approach still respects perspective but doesn’t clutter the drawing with unnecessary cubes in the distance.</p>

<p>I also think about <strong>camera movement</strong> in a scene. With a flexible four-point grid, it’s easy to imagine a <strong>car chase</strong> weaving through the streets, or a character walking from one building to the next. If a client or director wants more buildings in the shot, I can transform the entire grid, shift it, or scale it down. Then I simply extend the lines or add more shapes toward the foreground.</p>

<p>By making my own grids, I’ve gained a solid understanding of perspective. Once I grasped the basics, I felt freer to stylize or experiment, because I know how far I can push a shape or angle without losing believability.</p>

<p>I hope this helps you see how simple and powerful it can be to set up a <strong>four-point down shot grid</strong>. With a few curved lines, measuring tools, and a solid sense of overlap and scale, it’s amazing how quickly you can populate a scene from a towering viewpoint.</p>
