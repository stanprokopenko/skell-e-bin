<p>Hi everyone, I'm Marco Bucci, and I'm here to help you get started with using color in your digital paintings. When it comes to color, there are <strong>three main ways to modify a color</strong>. Let's go over these and talk about some terminology as we do.</p>

<h2>Understanding Hue</h2>

<p>This is a color wheel. It's not scary, in fact, my goal is to help you <strong>make the color wheel your friend</strong>. The color wheel shows you different hues, which is our first term.</p>

<h3>The Color Wheel and Hue</h3>

<p><strong>Hue</strong> is the name of the color, such as red, green, blue, purple, etc. Every digital painting app you use will have a color picker, and it shows you a color wheel where you can pick different hues for your paintings.</p>

<p>Here's the color picker in Photoshop, Painter, and Procreate. For now, let's ignore the middle part of these color pickers and just focus on the hue wheel that goes around them.</p>

<p>Depending on the version of Photoshop you might be using, you may see a vertical hue strip. But don't worry, it's the exact same progression of hues. They've just taken the color wheel and unwound it into a straight line. Side note, I actually find this format friendlier to work with. It's easier for me to click around those colors, but that's just me. Any app you choose will have this color picker at its heart.</p>

<h3>Primary and Secondary Colors</h3>

<p>This is where we get into a bit of color theory. You may have heard of the <strong>three primary colors</strong>: red, blue, and yellow. We consider these colors primary because, back in the day when you could only mix pigments to paint, these colors could not be created by mixing any other color. In fact, any other color could be created by mixing the three primaries.</p>

<p>For example, if you mix red and yellow, you get orange. Going back to the color wheel, the hues on the color wheel actually tell you this. As you can see, orange is right there between red and yellow. <strong>Violet</strong> is between blue and red, and <strong>green</strong> is the bridge between blue and yellow. These three new colors, violet, orange, and green, are known as <strong>secondary colors</strong>. They are direct mixtures of the primaries.</p>

<h2>Saturation</h2>

<p>But enough with basic theory for now. Let's get back to actual practice. If you're painting traditionally with acrylics or oils, you have to mix colors on your palette, and your resulting mixture is how you choose your color. With digital painting, though, this is not a requirement. In fact, often it's not even advisable to mix colors this way because most digital painting software doesn't treat colors like real-world pigments. So your mixtures digitally will look a bit different than if you mixed them traditionally.</p>

<p>For example, using real paint, I could mix this blue and this yellow and get a really vibrant green. But if I tried that digitally, the resulting color is greenish, but it lacks the vibrancy I just got with traditional paint. With digital painting, if I wanted that nice vibrant green, I would simply pick it.</p>

<h3>What Is Saturation?</h3>

<p>I've been using the word <strong>vibrant</strong>. There's an official color term for that, it's called <strong>saturation</strong>. Saturation is the amount of color in a hue, in other words, how vibrant it is or how much chroma it has. This is where I want to upgrade our color wheel.</p>

<p>I like this color wheel because it shows us <strong>two dimensions of color</strong>, hue and saturation. This is where that middle part of our color pickers comes back into play. Any hue can have a variety of saturation in it. For example, I could pick a red that is very saturated, a very vibrant red, or I can go the opposite way and pick a very desaturated red.</p>

<h3>The Role of Gray in Color</h3>

<p>Desaturating a color like that introduces a very important aspect of color theory. When you <strong>desaturate any hue</strong>, you are bringing it closer to <strong>gray</strong>. Going back to our color wheel here, we can see how important gray is because every hue has gray in common. That makes gray a very convenient way to travel from one color to another.</p>

<p>To quickly illustrate that idea, let's take a blank canvas and paint a bunch of very saturated colors onto it. I don't know about you, but to me, this is the visual equivalent of eating too much sugar, yuck! That's because the more saturated colors are, the more distance they have from other colors.</p>

<p>You can see this on the color wheel. If I plot out some very saturated colors on there, the path to get from one color to the next, especially colors on opposite ends of the color wheel, becomes very long. But if you <strong>desaturate</strong> these colors and bring them closer to gray, suddenly those paths get a lot shorter.</p>

<h3>Using Neutrals to Harmonize Colors</h3>

<p>A desaturated color that is not perfectly gray is often referred to as a <strong>neutral</strong> color, or as a verb, <strong>neutralizing</strong> the color. A neutral color can have some saturation to it, but generally it's close to gray.</p>

<p>Visually, desaturated or neutralized colors translate into a more pleasing visual aesthetic. For example, these are the same hues I painted before, only this time they're neutralized or desaturated, and suddenly they feel like they belong together a lot more. That's the power of gray, or neutrals, or desaturation. Different artists use different terms, but they all mean the same thing.</p>

<h2>Value</h2>

<p>It's now time to add a very important third term. That term is <strong>value</strong>. Value refers to the <strong>lightness or darkness</strong> of a color. Actually, you don't even need color to discuss value.</p>

<h3>Understanding Value</h3>

<p>Here's the grayscale chart. It's a list of tones from white to black and all the tones in between. These are values seen without color. Value is easily the most important element of your digital paintings because value determines the <strong>light and form</strong> of what you see.</p>

<h3>Value in Grayscale</h3>

<p>That's why if we switch this image to black and white right now, you can still tell perfectly what's going on. You don't need color. In fact, it's an extremely common practice regimen for an aspiring artist to only work in grayscale or black and white at first before adding hue and saturation into the mix.</p>

<h3>The Importance of Value Studies</h3>

<p>Now, value can be a bit tricky as far as the color wheel goes because the color wheel doesn't show us value. For example, this color and this color appear to be two different colors, but in fact, they are the same hue and therefore appear in the same place on the color wheel. This further illustrates how value is part of color, yes, but also on its own island.</p>

<p>It's always worthwhile to do <strong>pure value studies</strong> to heighten your understanding of form, which in turn will elevate your color work.</p>
