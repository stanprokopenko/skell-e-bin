<p>If you care about angles in your drawings, this guide is for you. We'll explore how to use common drafting triangles to measure various angles, especially in perspective drawing. Even if you're not familiar with all these techniques now, it's a useful reference for when you're ready to dive deeper.</p>

<h2>Using Triangles to Measure Common Angles</h2>

<h3>The 0 to 180 Degree Line and the 90 Degree Line</h3>

<p>To start, you can use your triangles to find the <strong>0 to 180-degree line</strong> and the <strong>90-degree line</strong>. For the 90-degree line, either triangle works since they both have a 90-degree angle.</p>

<h2>45-Degree Angles</h2>

<p>The <strong>45-degree triangle</strong> is perfect for finding a <strong>45-degree angle</strong>. Simply align it, and you're set. If you flip it the other way, you get the <strong>135-degree line</strong>. This works because you're adding 90 degrees to the original 45 degrees (45 + 90 = 135).</p>

<h2>60-Degree and 120-Degree Angles</h2>

<p>Using the <strong>60-degree angle</strong> on your triangle, you can easily measure a <strong>60-degree angle</strong>. Flipping it gives you a <strong>120-degree angle</strong>, which is double the original 60 degrees.</p>

<h2>30-Degree and 150-Degree Angles</h2>

<p>The same triangle doubles as a <strong>30-degree triangle</strong>. It provides a <strong>30-degree angle</strong>, and flipping it gives you a <strong>150-degree angle</strong>. The extra 120 degrees come from doubling the 60-degree angle.</p>

<h2>Measuring 15-Degree and 75-Degree Angles</h2>

<h3>Combining Triangles for 15 Degrees</h3>

<p>Some angles require using two triangles together. To get a <strong>15-degree angle</strong>, take the <strong>45-degree triangle</strong> and subtract the <strong>30-degree angle</strong> by slanting it back. This means you're removing 30 degrees from 45 degrees (45 - 30 = 15). Flipping this setup gives you the <strong>165-degree angle</strong> (180 - 15 = 165).</p>

<h3>Combining Triangles for 75 Degrees</h3>

<p>To find a <strong>75-degree angle</strong>, combine the <strong>30-degree</strong> and <strong>45-degree triangles</strong>. Adding these angles together gives you 75 degrees (30 + 45 = 75). Flipping it the other way yields the <strong>105-degree angle</strong>. This is 15 degrees above 90 degrees, just as 75 degrees is 15 degrees below 90.</p>

<h2>Do You Need to Memorize All These Angles?</h2>

<p>You don't have to memorize all these numbers to be good at freehand perspective. However, familiarizing yourself with the <strong>15-degree increments</strong> around the circle can enhance your understanding and skill. Think of the angles in terms of slices of pizza:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>90-degree wedge</strong>: Easy to recognize.</li>

<li><strong>45-degree wedge</strong>: A good-sized piece.</li>

<li><strong>30-degree wedge</strong>: Cutting back a bit.</li>

<li><strong>15-degree wedge</strong>: A small slice when you're feeling guilty.</li>

<li><strong>60-degree wedge</strong>: More indulgent.</li>

<li><strong>75-degree wedge</strong>: Really hogging it.</li>

</ul>

<p>Use these visualizations to help remember the angles.</p>

<h2>A Humorous Note</h2>

<p>Imagine you're stranded on a desert island and need to build a shelter. Knowing these angles could come in handy. While that's a bit far-fetched, it highlights the practical value of understanding angles in your work.</p>
