<h2>Why Gesture Is Fundamental</h2>

<p>Gesture is my <strong>fundamental design line</strong>. It’s more important than structure because it’s the <strong>long axis curve</strong> guiding us through lifelike connections. I see gesture as a <strong>connective strategy</strong>, how each part of the figure relates to the next. Whether it’s warm and cool colors working together or foreground relating to background, beauty is about these connections. Gesture leads us to that connection.</p>

<h2>Balancing Gesture and Structure</h2>

<p>I use gesture first, then add just enough structure to find my next gesture. If I don’t get enough structure, the next body part’s position and proportions can turn out poorly. So my process is:

1. Gesture #1 forms an overall direction.<br />

2. I build <strong>enough structure</strong> on Gesture #1.<br />

3. That structure helps me find Gesture #2.<br />

4. I build enough structure on Gesture #2 to find the next gesture.  </p>

<p>It can be a lot of structure if needed, but it’s always in service of guiding the next gesture.</p>

<h2>Working from the Narrowest Parts</h2>

<p>I look for the <strong>narrowest parts of the form</strong> to anchor my gesture line. From there, I can add:

- Bulging contours.<br />

- Secondary shapes (like egg forms for muscles).  </p>

<p>For example, on a leg:<br />

• My gesture line goes through the slimmer points at the knee or ankle.<br />

• Then I add the larger calf bulges as <strong>secondary forms</strong> on top of that line.  </p>

<p>Sometimes I miss the exact line, so I’ll adjust contours later. The key is that the gesture line anchors everything else.</p>

<h2>Finding the Longest Sustained Curve</h2>

<p>I focus on the <strong>longest sustained curve</strong> rather than the biggest bulge. A thigh might have a gentle curve that extends the entire length, while the hamstring bulges out on one side. For the gesture, I follow that <strong>dominant curve</strong>. Then I layer smaller shapes, bumps, or changes in contour on top.</p>

<p>I also keep an eye on how these curves transition. Often one side of the form will stay relatively straight or gently curved, while the other side has more pronounced bulges. The longest sustained curve is what unifies and directs the pose.</p>

<p>That’s how I approach gesture and structure. By prioritizing the long axis curve, working from the narrowest parts, and carefully adding structure, I keep my figure drawings connected and alive. I’ll revisit these ideas repeatedly to refine them further.</p>
