<p>When working on a drawing, it's crucial to prevent smudging, especially if you plan to continue adding details or layers. Using a <strong>workable fixative</strong> is the key to achieving this. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to apply it safely and effectively.</p>

<p><strong>Using a Workable Fixative</strong></p>

<p>It's important to choose a <strong>workable fixative</strong> rather than a final fixative. The workable fixative allows you to continue working on your drawing after application, preventing smudging while still being receptive to additional layers.</p>

<p><strong>Safety Precautions</strong></p>

<p>When applying the fixative, safety should be your top priority:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Spray the fixative outside</strong> to avoid inhaling harmful fumes.</li>

<li><strong>Hold your breath</strong> during the application to minimize exposure.</li>

<li>Focus on safety rather than documenting the process, so avoid videotaping while spraying.</li>

</ul>

<p><strong>Application Process</strong></p>

<p>Here's how to apply the fixative properly:</p>

<ul>

<li>Perform the spraying on a <strong>porch or outdoor area</strong>. This ensures good ventilation and reduces the risk of inhaling fumes.</li>

<li>After spraying, <strong>leave the drawing outside</strong> for about an hour and a half. This allows the fumes to dissipate completely.</li>

<li>Bringing the drawing inside too soon can result in a lingering smell, indicating that fumes are still present.</li>

</ul>

<p><strong>Continuing the Artwork</strong></p>

<p>Once the fumes have cleared, you can proceed with your artwork:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Mix your paint</strong> and prepare to continue working on your drawing.</li>

<li>With the fixative applied, your drawing is now protected from smudging, allowing you to add more details or layers confidently.</li>

</ul>

<p>By following these steps, you can ensure that your drawing remains smudge-free and ready for further work.</p>
