<h2>What's in Premium?</h2>

<p>In this lesson, we focus on enhancing your gesture drawings by emphasizing rhythm and connections, specifically in standing poses. You'll learn how to:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Separate contour from rhythm and abstraction</strong> to create a strong foundation.</li>

<li><strong>Set up a blueprint</strong> for developing gestures into full figures.</li>

<li><strong>Examine rhythm</strong> in your drawings and address unintentional symmetry.</li>

<li><strong>Explain differences in weight</strong> to add depth and realism.</li>

</ul>

<p>Through examples like Hermes running, we'll demonstrate how to:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Initiate rhythm on a diagonal</strong> to introduce movement and drama.</li>

<li><strong>Emphasize thrust and counter-thrust</strong> between the ribcage and pelvis.</li>

<li><strong>Use wrapping lines</strong> for foreshortening and depth.</li>

<li><strong>Adjust limbs</strong> to enhance flow and unity in your figures.</li>

</ul>

<p>We'll also cover:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Connecting limbs seamlessly</strong> into the torso's rhythm.</li>

<li><strong>Creating flow</strong> throughout the figure without relying on contours.</li>

<li><strong>Handling back views</strong> with opposite wrapping lines.</li>

<li><strong>Adding interest to symmetrical poses</strong> by introducing diagonals.</li>

</ul>

<p>By focusing on the story and design of your poses, you'll learn to convey emotion and movement effectively. We'll provide practical tips for practicing gesture drawing and highlight common issues to avoid, such as overemphasis on contour and unintentional symmetry.</p>
