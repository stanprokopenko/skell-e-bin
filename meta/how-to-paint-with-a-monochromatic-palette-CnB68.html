<p>As artists, we can use color palettes to create different moods and feels in our paintings. Let's start with a simple sphere and explore how to use a monochromatic palette to bring it to life.</p>

<h2>Understanding Color Palettes</h2>

<p>A palette is the full range of colors you're allowed to use in a painting. While there are no strict rules, limiting your palette can be helpful. A <strong>monochromatic palette</strong> uses just one hue but allows for a range of warm to cool within that hue. This brings a strong presence of a single color to your picture, which can evoke certain emotions or match specific subject matters.</p>

<p>For example, Paul Hussain's painting for Lord of the Rings uses a blue monochromatic palette. Even though it's all blue, you can clearly see warm and cool passages. This is achieved by varying the saturation of the blue.</p>

<h2>Setting Up the Digital Painting</h2>

<p>I've traced a sphere from one of John's lessons, including the terminator line (dividing light and shadow) and the cast shadow. I've also indicated the light direction.</p>

<p>To start, I create a color chart at the bottom of my canvas. For this demonstration, I'm choosing a warm red as my base color. I'll use a range from fully saturated red to completely desaturated gray.</p>

<p>In my digital painting software, I set up layers:

- Background layer

- Sphere layer

- Line drawing layer (set to multiply mode)

- Reference layer (locked)</p>

<h2>Painting the Environment</h2>

<p>I start with the background, using my most saturated red. I'm keeping things painterly and brushy for now. I adjust the value to make sure the sphere will pop out from the background.</p>

<p>For the ground, I use a lighter, less saturated red. This introduces the concept of color temperature - the more saturated red appears warmer than the less saturated red.</p>

<p>I use a technique called <strong>scumbling</strong> - directional scribbling with some structure - to create texture and blend colors.</p>

<h2>Painting the Sphere</h2>

<h3>Establishing Base Colors</h3>

<p>I start with a mid-tone red for the base of the sphere. Then, I lay in the shadows using a darker, less saturated red. Remember, I've decided to make my light source warm, so the shadows will be cooler (less saturated) reds.</p>

<h3>Adding Form and Depth</h3>

<p>Next, I add <strong>halftones</strong> - the gradual darkening as the form turns away from the light. I focus on the area where the form is turning significantly away from the light, almost meeting the shadow.</p>

<p>I use an airbrush to softly blend the halftones. This is appropriate for a sphere because of its smooth, round form.</p>

<p>To make the sphere look shiny, I add a <strong>highlight</strong> - the lightest part of the painting - where the light directly reflects off the surface.</p>

<h3>Refining Shadows</h3>

<p>I paint in the <strong>occlusion shadow</strong> - the darkest part of the shadow where the sphere meets the ground. This gives the sphere a sense of weight and grounds it.</p>

<p>Then I add <strong>reflected light</strong> in the shadow areas. This is warmer than the rest of the shadow because it's picking up the warm light bouncing off the environment. Remember, reflected light is weaker than direct light, so it won't be as warm as the lit side of the sphere.</p>

<h2>Advanced Techniques and Refinements</h2>

<p>To unify the painting, I merge the sphere and background layers. This allows me to brush over everything for a more painterly look.</p>

<p>I experiment with color temperature by introducing slightly cooler passages on the warm lit side of the ball. As long as the lit side remains overall warmer than the shadow side, these subtle temperature changes can create appealing results.</p>

<p>To make bigger color temperature adjustments, I use a new layer set to overlay mode. This allows me to alter the overall color temperature while maintaining the underlying value structure.</p>

<p>Finally, I use the Color Dodge mode to increase contrast and pop around the edges of the ball, helping it stand out from the background.</p>

<p>Remember, painting is a process of constant refinement. Don't be afraid to go back and adjust areas you've already painted. The key is to maintain the overall relationship of warm lights and cool shadows while introducing subtle variations within each area.</p>

<p>Practicing this monochromatic sphere painting will help you understand how to use color temperature to create form and depth. As you get more comfortable, you can move on to more complex palettes and subjects. Happy painting!</p>
