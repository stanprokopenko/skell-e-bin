<h2>Avoiding the Vanishing Point Trap</h2>

<p>Starting with <strong>vanishing points</strong> and drawing <strong>straight lines with rulers</strong> can be misleading when you're unsure where the vanishing points should go. It's simple in a book where the artist has placed them for you to copy, but on your own, there are countless wrong places to put them. <strong>Let's not start there.</strong></p>

<h2>Beginning with Blobs</h2>

<p>It's better to <strong>rough things in</strong> first. Start with a simple, rough shape, a <strong>blob</strong>. Draw a line around something, a line across it, or maybe slice off an end. You can begin by slicing off an end, and then <strong>echo that line</strong> across the visible side. The blob <strong>exists</strong>.</p>

<h3>Making It a Box</h3>

<p>To transform the blob into a box:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Snap lines tight</strong>.</li>

<li>Add <strong>corners</strong> and <strong>square it up</strong>.</li>

<li>Remember that there are <strong>three axes</strong>: the long axis (aspect line), and the two other axes at the corners.</li>

</ul>

<p>But start roughly and lightly. Don't worry about vanishing points yet. Just <strong>aim in a general direction</strong> and <strong>fling the line away</strong>.</p>

<h2>Understanding Convex and Concave Curves</h2>

<p>Get into the habit of recognizing that the <strong>convex side of a curve indicates depth</strong>. The curve is convex in the direction it goes away. Think of it like a rubber band stretched around your blob, the convex outside of the curve says <strong>away</strong>. Conversely, the concave side appears closer.</p>

<h3>Training Your Perception</h3>

<p>Practice this concept:</p>

<ul>

<li>Draw a blob with a <strong>convex curve</strong> pointing away.</li>

<li>A <strong>concave curve</strong> can make a side look closer.</li>

<li>Remember, it's an illusion created by lines on flat paper.</li>

</ul>

<p>You're training your brain as much as your hand. <strong>Get that habit first and fast.</strong></p>

<h2>Advancing Your Skills</h2>

<p>If you're ready for a challenge and feel that blobs are too simple, try <strong>reversing the curves</strong>:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Scoop out</strong> a section of your blob.</li>

<li>Reverse the rubber band concept - the <strong>concave curve</strong> now goes away from you.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Inspiration from the Masters</h3>

<p>Want to see this in action? Look at the work of great masters:</p>

<ul>

<li>Their freehand sketches show breathtaking skill.</li>

<li>Notice how they reverse lines where necessary.</li>

<li><strong>Gaze at greatness</strong> to increase your chances of steering toward it.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Squaring Up the Blob</h2>

<p>To further challenge yourself:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Square up</strong> your blob.</li>

<li>Add precise lines and corners.</li>

<li>Try this multiple times, inventing new positions each time.</li>

</ul>

<p>If your lines go wild, ask yourself:</p>

<ul>

<li>Do you understand the relationship between the <strong>scoop</strong> and the <strong>squarely chiseled groove</strong>?</li>

<li>Are you advancing in making your lines <strong>recede</strong> and controlling the world in your picture?</li>

</ul>

<h2>Practice and Progress</h2>

<p>Blobs may not be sophisticated or precise, but they are <strong>3D</strong>. Starting with a blob gives you a three-dimensional something to make precise. This is the simplest way to get started with drawing objects.</p>

<p>By continually practicing and understanding these concepts, you're getting closer to <strong>reality</strong> in your drawings.</p>
