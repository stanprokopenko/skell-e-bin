<h2>What's in Premium?</h2>

<p>In this lesson, we dive into the <strong>line art</strong> stage of drawing, focusing on techniques to enhance depth and volume. You'll learn how to use <strong>cross contours</strong> to indicate form without hard lines, and discover how lines can express <strong>volume</strong>, inspired by artists like Kim Jung Gi. We discuss incorporating <strong>character design elements</strong> to add interest and break up large areas, such as adding patches or accessories.</p>

<p>The lesson covers the use of <strong>occluded shadows</strong> in line art to define volumes and suggest shading. We talk about the <strong>brushes and tools</strong> used, like the Max Pack comic brushes in Procreate, and share insights on choosing between <strong>digital and traditional drawing</strong> methods. </p>

<p>You'll gain personal insights into dealing with struggles in line art, developing your unique <strong>style</strong>, and understanding the importance of grasping underlying <strong>volumes</strong> in your work. We address common challenges like frustration and offer strategies to keep your art <strong>fresh</strong> and maintain motivation.</p>

<p>Finally, we share experiences from the artist's journey, emphasizing the value of continuous practice and finishing pieces to develop your skills. By the end of the lesson, you'll be prepared to move on to the next step: <strong>flatting and coloring</strong> your artwork.</p>
