<h2>Understanding Basic Form</h2>

<p>I like to begin with simple shapes, like cylinders, to explore <strong>how forms turn</strong>. Imagine looking at a cylinder from the side: it’s basically a rectangle in two dimensions. As soon as I tilt it, the ellipses of the top and bottom come into view. Turning it more reveals how ellipses get wider or narrower, yet the front and back edges remain parallel if perspective isn’t in play. In that pure rotation, there’s no taper or change in the size of ellipses.</p>

<p>But when I add <strong>perspective</strong>, those parallel lines now converge, and scale changes appear between the front and back ellipses. If I push that scale change dramatically, it creates a powerful sense of <strong>foreshortening</strong>. When I stack or overlap the ellipses, then connect top and bottom, I get even more depth.</p>

<h2>Scale and Overlapping</h2>

<p><strong>Scale change</strong> is one of the most important things to control in foreshortening. When I move closer planes together, and increase the overall size of what’s nearest the viewer, it strengthens the illusion of depth. This also applies to figures, if an arm is reaching toward me, the muscle masses naturally get bigger near the viewer. I often adjust shapes in the overlapping sections, like making the elbow region slightly bigger, so the overall visual read still feels convincing.</p>

<p>If the scale difference is too small, the foreshortening looks weak. If I push a single part too far without scaling everything else, it looks disconnected, almost like I pinned a large shape onto a normal-sized figure. I need a <strong>smooth transition of size</strong> from whatever is farthest away to whatever is closest.</p>

<h2>Applying Foreshortening to Figures</h2>

<p>I practice this with <strong>primitive forms</strong> on the figure first. For an arm reaching out, I might start with a shoulder cylinder, then a forearm cylinder, making the one closer to me bigger and overlapping the far shapes behind it. Then I refine the silhouette: the wrist area might feel too large unless I adjust muscle volume around the elbow or shoulder to keep the anatomy believable.</p>

<p>Using <strong>simple thumbnails</strong> helps. I can test how much I want to overlap or exaggerate the body parts. I also figure out how to place the torso or hips, knowing that many details might get hidden or overlapped. With foreshortening, some forms disappear behind others. I embrace that loss of visible parts.</p>

<h2>Experimentation and Exaggeration</h2>

<p>I sometimes do a tight drawing first, then start over more freely for a second pass. That switch often feels more alive and spontaneous. I find <strong>extreme</strong> angles by playing with big scale shifts: maybe a huge head, then shrunken legs. If it’s too weird, at least I tried pushing it. The freedom to experiment is key.</p>

<p>When I lose elements behind overlaps, it can feel awkward, especially if I still want to show every detail. Sometimes I have to give up details to sell the illusion of depth. If my figure looks too flat, I know I was probably too safe. By carefully overlapping parts and <strong>pushing perspective</strong>, I can create strong movement and depth.</p>

<h2>Dynamic Angles: Top-Down vs. Low Angle</h2>

<p>I explored a <strong>top-down</strong> angle on a troll-like character, which gave me a chance to show a <strong>big head</strong> and upper torso close to the viewer, while the legs shrink farther back. Alternatively, a <strong>low angle</strong> lets me place the camera by the feet, looking up. The torso and arms loom large above, and the head sits back in space. Both angles benefit from drawn or imagined perspective lines, and sometimes I lightly sketch the curves and arches to keep track.</p>

<p>Though I might not always show these guidelines, I still rely on them mentally. Even a few arcs help position the shoulders, hips, and limbs in believable 3D space.</p>

<h2>Finding Your Expression</h2>

<p>After years of practicing form and perspective, I’ve been challenging myself to <strong>loosen up</strong> and focus on <strong>expressiveness</strong> and personality too. All the technique in the world doesn’t matter if the sketch feels stiff. So, I let myself break a few rules. I’ll push proportions, exaggerate lines, or explore a different style to capture energy and story. I find that advanced mastery of perspective and anatomy eventually frees me to experiment creatively, without losing structure.</p>

<p>I’m inspired by artists like Kim Jung Gi, Moebius, and others who have that natural look of improvisation and confidence in their drawings. It’s a reminder that perspective, construction, and shape design aren’t a “style.” They’re tools that help me say something visually. Once I have a strong foundation, I can decide how far I want to bend or ignore the rules to get the expression I want.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p>Foreshortening is more than just drawing something “big in front.” It involves careful <strong>scale change</strong>, <strong>overlapping</strong>, and the choice of <strong>camera angles</strong>. I start with cylinders, then translate that knowledge to the figure. I push forms, experiment with extreme angles, and then find a balance where it looks dynamic yet believable.</p>

<p>Ultimately, I don’t want to be locked into rigid formulas. I want solid technique to support my ideas, and give me the boldness to exaggerate. Foreshortening is an ongoing exploration, one that I find endlessly exciting as I test boundaries and deepen my visual language.</p>
