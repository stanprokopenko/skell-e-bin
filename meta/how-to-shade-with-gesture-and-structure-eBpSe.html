<h2>Materials</h2>

<p>I like to use <strong>Strathmore 500 series</strong> paper. For drawing, I use <strong>Conte of Paris</strong>, usually a <strong>2B</strong> pencil, but any will do. I have some <strong>charcoal pencils</strong>, and they can be any brand. I often use <strong>Alphacolor</strong> sticks, which come in little squares like pastels. They're great for getting rich darks when I want to lay in light and shadow for structure and gesture.</p>

<p>I use a <strong>kneaded eraser</strong>, and I prefer using a <strong>dirty one</strong>, I'll show you why later. I also have a <strong>hard eraser</strong>, which I use to really pop out the lights and highlights. A <strong>brush</strong> is handy to whisk off any eraser debris. I keep a <strong>sanding pad</strong> to load up my <strong>stump</strong>, which is just a rolled paper pencil with no pigment. I'll use the sanding pad or the Alphacolor, I load it up so I can make my marks. Finally, I use a <strong>paper towel</strong> and my <strong>fingers</strong> to scrub in tones.</p>

<h2>Starting with Structure and Gesture</h2>

<p>I'm going to work on <strong>structure and gesture</strong>, and I'll show you how I lay in a figure. It's not so different from many construction styles, but I'm trying to understand first the <strong>two-dimensional</strong> flat shape, just like graphic design, and then the <strong>three-dimensional</strong> form. At the same time, I'm focusing on the <strong>structure</strong> with the <strong>gesture</strong>.</p>

<p>To me, there are two foundational ideas in any drawing, and in fact, these are the two foundational ideas of every art form: <strong>how the separate parts connect with the greater whole</strong>. It's a compositional idea. I want to get a beautiful shape for the head, the neck, and all the body parts, and then I want to find a <strong>connective strategy</strong> between those parts.</p>

<p>Not only do I want a connective strategy, but within the design of the parts themselves, I want to capture <strong>life energy</strong>. Sometimes we can draw parts that have wonderful solid forms, yet they feel lifeless. The thing about living structures, especially organic ones, is that they're mainly water, so they have a <strong>watery design</strong>. That watery design is really just a series of <strong>curves</strong> and <strong>opposing curves</strong>.</p>

<h2>The Importance of the Long Axis Curve</h2>

<p>If I can find the <strong>curves</strong> and the <strong>S-curves</strong> down the <strong>long axis</strong> of any particular form, that is going to be the connection. I'll move down the long axis of the ribcage, pick it up in the waist and then the hips, and so on. Each area, the ribcage, waist, and hips, can have good solidity.</p>

<h3>Example: Drawing a Tube</h3>

<p>Let's think about a simple architectural shape, say a <strong>tube</strong>. I can draw a tube by drawing one side, then the other side, and then the end. If I'm trying to get structure, I give it a three-dimensional end. I move it not just around the form like a flat shadow but <strong>over the form</strong>. Moving over the form means you're breaking the contour with those marks.</p>

<p>Those beautiful construction lines, rendered forms, and gradations moving both around and over the form, that's <strong>structure</strong>. But if I take that same idea and simply make those <strong>long axis sides curved</strong>, now it has a little bit of a flow, a watery idea. Then I can combine it with the next simple shape with the same curve, maybe with an opposing curve, and that is going to be that connective watery energy.</p>

<h3>Life in the Long Axis Curve</h3>

<p>Generally, the more curves you make with the long axis forms, the more fluid and alive they become. So the <strong>life is in that long axis curve</strong>. That's a very simple idea, but it takes time to actually craft it, learn to see it, and remember to infuse it into your drawing.</p>

<h2>Balancing Intuition and Theory</h2>

<p>In my own work and when I work with other artists, I like to think of these things <strong>intuitively</strong> first, and then much later, if I need it, weave in the wonderful theories, the engineering models. I think of it like linear perspective, anatomy, and laws of light. You can put in all that theory, and sometimes it's important to have that. But if we can think of these problems intuitively first, they are usually less overwhelming and less intimidating.</p>

<p>Since they're intuitive, it's easier to play with them. We can feel freer to bend or break the rules a little bit. Sometimes I might see or design an area, like the upper arm, that's stiff and straight and doesn't have the long axis curve. I'll make it stiffer. But then when I get to the next form, I'll play up that curve again. So I can mix and match these things.</p>

<h2>Applying Structure and Gesture Together</h2>

<p><strong>Structure</strong> is the movement <strong>over the form</strong>, while <strong>gesture</strong> is the movement <strong>between the forms</strong>. Since the human body is connected end to end, we're thinking of the long axis curve. That's going to end the forearm, but it's also going to begin the hand, and that will end the hand but begin the fingers, and so on.</p>

<p>We're looking for simple intuitive ideas at first, and then we can weave in more sophisticated ideas, including even conceptual, emotional, and spiritual ideas for our compositions. But it all starts with understanding the part and bringing the energy and the connective strategy into that part.</p>

<p>Usually, as I draw these things, I'll draw them somewhat two-dimensionally and then build back into them with more refined, maybe smaller two-dimensional shapes. Maybe I'll draw the egg for the ribcage, just one half of the ribcage, and I'll come back in and build a slightly more, or significantly more, refined structure on the bigger, simpler structure I started with.</p>

<h2>Shading and Rendering</h2>

<p>When I feel confident with my structure, I will start building more rendering on that. Since I'm a dramatic tonal guy, a <strong>chiaroscuro</strong> guy, I'll then come in with the <strong>shadow shapes</strong> and start building those. Often, the shadow shapes will be their own way of double-checking the construction.</p>

<h3>The Process of Shading</h3>

<p>I use a simple process:</p>

<ol>

<li><strong>Draw two sides of the form</strong> to establish the shape.</li>

<li><strong>Shape the shadow on the form</strong>, using the core shadow.</li>

<li><strong>Give the shadow a value</strong> by filling it in.</li>

<li><strong>Squint at it</strong> to check if it's dark enough to separate the shadow from the light.</li>

</ol>

<p>I make the <strong>core shadow</strong>, that initial long axis shadow shape, slightly darker than the body. That gives a feeling of reflected light without having to render it or even think about it. Then I can render <strong>over the form</strong>.</p>

<h3>Rounding the Form</h3>

<p>I can soften the edge of the core shadow to set up for rendering. If I want to describe a form that's not truly box-like but more rounded, I'll soften that edge and extend it into a gradation. This gradation <strong>moves us over the form</strong>.</p>

<p>The <strong>shape of the shadow</strong>, the core shadow, is the <strong>corner of the form</strong>. If the light moved, the corner would move, but I think of it as the corner of the form, which is <strong>structure</strong>. Then I round the corner by softening the edge and extending it into a full gradation to give that rendered egg.</p>

<h3>Keeping Shadows Dark and Lights Light</h3>

<p>As I work, I make sure that the shadows are dark enough, so they separate from the lights. If the halftones get too dark, they might start to look the same value as the shadows. In that case, I'll lighten the halftones or I will darken the shadows. Ideally, the shadows are <strong>dark</strong> and the lights are <strong>light</strong>. We're telling a story, the villains are evil, and the heroes are good. We start with a simple concept, and then get more subtle and nuanced later.</p>

<h2>Moving Down the Form</h2>

<p>Remember our process, I drew the simple ribcage, then the waist, and then the hips. I drew the long axis, the <strong>gesture</strong>. Then I drew the short axis, the <strong>structure</strong>. I moved down the form, hopefully with a curve, to show the gesture. I moved over the form to show the volume, the structure. I stacked end to end each successive structure, and each structure began a new gesture, and so on.</p>

<p>I'm doing the same thing with my rendered tone. I'm moving down, and then I'm moving over the form with gradations that tie those tones together on either side. It all comes down to <strong>curves and corners</strong>. When we construct it, it's exactly the same when we render it.</p>

<h2>Curves and Corners in Rendering</h2>

<p>The ribcage separates from the waist and does not flow beautifully together, but breaks away. When it flows beautifully together, it's going to be a curve or, every once in a while, it will be a straight. When it breaks away, it's going to be a <strong>corner</strong>, it might be an exterior corner or an interior corner like the armpit or the small of the back.</p>

<p>When the forms break away from each other, we create a corner in line, and we do the same when it's a corner in the tone, specifically the <strong>shadow shape</strong>. The core shadow is the beginning of the form, the corner of the form, and we render it as a rounded corner. The <strong>cast shadow</strong> is the abrupt interruption into that form, starting another form. When the forms don't flow together, we get a corner.</p>

<p>I take the soft edge of the core shadow and bump it against a <strong>hard edge</strong> of the cast shadow. Then I begin the next curve and do the same process again. The constructed reality is that things will flow together in curves or break away in corners. It's exactly true in terms of the rendered tones as it is in the constructed lines or finished contours.</p>

<h2>Simplifying the Problems</h2>

<p>By keeping my thinking the same, I'm not having to change my approach. I go down a curve, and then I hit a corner. I go down a curve or sometimes a straight before I hit an opposing corner, and then I stop and work across. I go down until I hit some new idea, a change in curve or a break at a corner, then I render across.</p>

<p>I draw the <strong>gesture</strong> and then add some <strong>structure</strong>. All the way down to the finish and eventually into the smallest, most subtle forms, not just the big forms.</p>

<p>If we can do that, it makes things easier. Every mark I'm making from the beginning to the end is in alignment with my thinking. <strong>When in doubt, simplify</strong>. Break the problems down into manageable steps. You'll level up better, and your audience will thank you.</p>

<h2>Working with Shadows and Halftones</h2>

<p>As I blend this process, I can change my mind at any time. I might decide I need to adjust that shadow shape, or find an opportunity that the reference isn't giving me. I can even change the order, going from top to bottom first and then from left side to right side second.</p>

<p>I can evolve any of these things, and the little things. If you understand the basic ideas, the basic happenings of what nature is giving you, structure and gesture, or your basic intentions, you can riff off it.</p>

<h3>Adding Reflected Lights</h3>

<p>I might decide to pull out the <strong>reflected lights</strong>, picking them out by erasing rather than adding pigment. I want shadows dark and lights light, but if I push those strong reflected lights well away from the light side, we can get away from that rule. Usually, I'll still make those a little darker so they settle in, and then I might push the lights lighter with lighter halftones and even highlights.</p>

<p>When I do the shadow shape, I go to the edge where that shadow begins, the edge of the core or the cast, and then blend into the body of it. When I do the lighter tones, I go to the <strong>hottest spot</strong>, where it's brightest, and then it naturally gradates off into ever-darker halftones.</p>

<h3>Using Erasers for Highlights</h3>

<p>I'll use the harder eraser to pick out the highlights. If I'm really digging into a piece and scrubbing it aggressively, that pigment might be embedded into the paper. This is where the <strong>kneaded eraser</strong> comes in handy, especially a dirty one. I can also use a brush to whisk off any little flecks of eraser.</p>

<h2>Adding Secondary Forms</h2>

<p>Now let's add some secondary forms. I might want to reinvent the ribcage so it's not just an egg but has the ribs in there. I'll come back to the core and do the long axis curve. The ribs are going diagonally from upper left to lower right, so instead of going down the long axis, I'll go down and across.</p>

<p>As we get into these smaller forms, I probably won't do every rib. I'll pick one or two. I don't want them to be repetitive. Organic things evolve and never stay the same for very long. I want to vary these little things so they don't, in terms of design, look unnatural.</p>

<h3>Balancing Detail and Simplicity</h3>

<p>Each rib is a little different from its neighbors, they're the same yet different. They're in the family of forms, yet individual in character. I can dirty up my kneaded eraser so it doesn't take much pigment off, and I can dust these back. I don't want them to overwhelm the ribcage, so I might play back and forth a couple of times. That way the little things aren't stealing the thunder from the big thing. You feel the full big ribcage first, and whatever little things we do respect that bigger idea.</p>

<h2>Embracing Mistakes as Opportunities</h2>

<p>I like the screw-ups. I work fast and loose with these things, really trying to create screw-ups in a way. Sometimes a screw-up is a screw-up, but other times it's an <strong>opportunity</strong>. By moving a line or making a change, it might show the tension in the back or the energy of the figure moving into that pose or coming out of it.</p>

<p>I'll draw several lines and let the audience figure out the right line. I got that from Pontormo, a famous Mannerist and one of my favorite artists. He would draw several lines, sometimes several nipples, trying to find the right one. I love that kind of searching idea.</p>

<p>Since I'm drawing action figures, that's my aesthetic, drawing these several lines gives a feeling like a comic book rocket ship taking off, the feeling of action. I kind of hide my mistakes, I let them serve a different purpose. In other words, I'm redefining what <strong>right</strong> is.</p>

<h2>Defining Your Own Style</h2>

<p>In the real world, there is no line. It's not just values, it's something a little different or a lot different. When we redefine what right is for us, that is our <strong>style</strong>. If you look at any artists you love or any art movement, they've redefined what right is, and that's a little or a lot different than the real world.</p>

<p>That gives us permission to play and even permission to make mistakes because those mistakes might turn into something really wonderful for our work.</p>

<h2>Connecting Everything Together</h2>

<p>Every mark I'm making is in alignment with my thinking, connecting these beautiful things, composing. Life is connected, it's an ecosystem. Spiritual traditions are connected, the physical to the metaphysical. Anything that's beautiful in this world usually means there's some <strong>connection</strong>, and some connective strategy.</p>

<p>Those beautiful colors are all shifting towards the warm reds of the fiery light. The forms of the human body are all fluid in design, flowing like a gentle current or a raging river. The <strong>tones</strong>, the <strong>gradation</strong>, is the connective strategy for the tones.</p>

<p>Whether it's called a highlight, a halftone, reflected light, or core, if you move down the long axis and then blend over the short axis with your dark marks or your light marks, it's going to ring true to the beautiful mass being of light and the beautiful, fluid, elegant design.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p>You can take this much farther than what we've done or keep it much simpler. I hope this helps and gives you a sense of the possibilities. Remember, <strong>when in doubt, simplify</strong>. Break the problems down into manageable steps. You'll level up better, and your audience will thank you.</p>
