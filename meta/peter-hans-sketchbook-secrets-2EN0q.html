<h2>The Dynamic Bible Sketchbook</h2>

<p>In 2016, I used a <strong>Strathmore Watercolor Sketchbook</strong> to create the <strong>Dynamic Bible</strong>. This sketchbook was filled with <strong>lecture notes</strong>, visuals, and teaching methods from my classes at ArtCenter and other schools. I drew directly with pen and watercolor, scanning the pages to produce the book. Initially, it was a personal project to ensure my students understood my teachings. But after sharing it, people encouraged me to publish it. Eventually, I launched a Kickstarter, edited the text, and shared the Dynamic Bible with a wider audience.</p>

<h2>The Traveler's Journal</h2>

<p>For my travels, I often use the <strong>Midori Traveler's Journal</strong>. It's a compact, leather-bound sketchbook perfect for collecting <strong>drawings</strong>, <strong>notes</strong>, <strong>stickers</strong>, and <strong>stamps</strong>. Whether I'm sketching fountains in Italy, drawing pitcher plants at the Arboretum, or attending a bug fair at the LA Natural History Museum, this journal captures my experiences. I include observations, collected materials like birch bark or fur, and write down thoughts and quotes that inspire me. It's a tangible record of my journeys, filled with small sketches and memorabilia.</p>

<h2>Accordion Sketchbooks</h2>

<p>Discovering <strong>accordion sketchbooks</strong> opened up a new way of drawing for me. The continuous fold of the pages challenges me to create images that <strong>transition smoothly</strong> from one to the next. In my first accordion book, I explored themes from aquatic life to history, allowing each page to flow into the next. I enjoy playing with <strong>composition</strong>, ensuring that elements connect and guide the viewer's eye across the pages. I've filled several of these books, each with varied themes like airplanes, monsters, and arm wrestling. The format pushes me to think creatively about how each drawing relates to the next.</p>

<h2>Large Format Sketchbooks</h2>

<p>I also love working in <strong>large format sketchbooks</strong>. I found one in Austria with paper that lays flat, which is great for expansive drawings. In these books, I dive into a variety of subjects: <strong>Mongolian culture</strong>, machinery, figurative work, and more. I mostly use fountain pens, brush pens, and markers, and I often draw on location. For instance, I sketched at the Pantheon in Rome and captured moments from my trips to Africa, observing cheetahs and lions in the wild. These larger pages allow me to focus on <strong>single imagery</strong> and illustrate more detailed scenes.</p>

<h2>Inspiration and Observation</h2>

<p>My sketchbooks are filled with a vast array of subjects because I'm drawn to the very act of <strong>visualizing and drawing</strong>. From familiar characters to wildlife studies, I let my interests guide me. I've drawn everything from <strong>arm wrestling figures</strong>, which are surprisingly challenging, to transformation sequences in my accordion books. Observing the world around me is crucial. Whether I'm at a museum, in nature, or watching sports, I capture what fascinates me. I also include studies from memory and imagination, pushing my skills further.</p>

<h2>Relationship with Materials</h2>

<p>I have a deep <strong>relationship with my materials</strong>. When I found a raggedy old sketchbook in Utah with rough, absorbent paper, it spoke to me. The character of the book and its unique paper inspired me to draw more. I believe in forming connections with my tools, as they enhance the creative process. Even inanimate objects like sketchbooks can have a personality that influences my work.</p>

<h2>The Importance of Finishing Sketchbooks</h2>

<p>Finishing a sketchbook brings a sense of <strong>satisfaction and accomplishment</strong>. Each book becomes an individual with its own stories and experiences. I typically finish about 10 to 12 sketchbooks a year, and each one holds memories of where I was and what I was feeling at the time. Looking back through them, I can see my growth and recall moments from my life. They're more than just drawings, they're a record of my journey as an artist.</p>

<h2>Collecting Experiences</h2>

<p>Beyond drawing, I <strong>collect experiences</strong>. In my travel journals, I include tickets, leaflets, business cards, and other memorabilia. I sketch people on trains, collect stamps from places I've been, and jot down thoughts and observations. Even when I'm not drawing, I'm observing and gathering inspiration. These journals are a blend of sketches and collected items, representing my adventures and the world as I see it.</p>
