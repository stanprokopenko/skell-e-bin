<h2>Yearbook Principle in Painting</h2>

<p>Let's dive into the <strong>yearbook principle</strong> in painting. This concept is all about focusing on <strong>darks and lights</strong> in the early stages of a painting. It might seem flat at first, but this approach is crucial for capturing the <strong>essence of the subject</strong>. By concentrating on these contrasts, we lay the groundwork for a more dynamic and expressive piece.</p>

<h2>John Singer Sargent's Technique</h2>

<p>John Singer Sargent was a master at working with <strong>lights against darks</strong>. His technique involved <strong>minimal modeling</strong>, emphasizing <strong>edges, simple values, and perfect shapes</strong>. This method allowed him to create paintings that were both simple and profound. Sargent's ability to capture the essence of his subjects with such economy of detail is something we can all learn from.</p>

<h2>Anecdote from Art School</h2>

<p>I have a funny story from art school. My teacher, Dan Cooper, gave me a Sargent book. It was possibly stolen from a library, but it was my first exposure to Sargent's work. This book, mostly in black and white, was a treasure. It was before the famous 1980s Sargent book, and it opened my eyes to his incredible technique.</p>

<h2>Studying Sargent in Black and White</h2>

<p>Back in the 1980s, studying Sargent in black and white was common because we didn't have the internet. The reproductions were often of poor quality, sometimes blown out, but even then, the <strong>essence of Sargent's work</strong> shone through. Despite these limitations, the simplicity and effectiveness of his technique were evident.</p>

<h2>The Essence of Sargent's Paintings</h2>

<p>The simplicity of black and white photos really highlighted the essence of Sargent's paintings. Take the <strong>Lady Agnew painting</strong>, for example. Even in black and white, its beauty is undeniable. Sargent used <strong>minimal values in the skin</strong> and focused on <strong>separating lights from shadows</strong> to capture the essence. This approach is something we can all strive for in our work.</p>

<h2>Importance of Edges and Values</h2>

<p>Understanding <strong>edges</strong> is crucial for finishing a painting effectively. Right now, we're focusing on achieving the <strong>yearbook effect</strong> with light and shadow. This involves a careful balance of values to create a compelling image. We'll discuss the transition from light to dark later in the painting process, but for now, mastering edges and values is key to capturing the essence of your subject.</p>
