<p>In the last video, I walked you through the six steps of figure drawing in detail. In this drawing, I'm going to take you through those steps much more quickly to show you that the process can be more expedient and not always bogged down with explanation. Let's do another one with the same model but a different pose.</p>

<h2>Starting with Gesture</h2>

<p>I begin with the <strong>gesture</strong> for this drawing. It's a complicated pose, a lean forward with a bit of a bend. Definitely one of the more challenging poses, perhaps in the difficult pose category. The weight is on one side, and the arm is raised. The head is slightly turned, tilting and the figure is leaning forward.</p>

<p>When starting the gesture, it's good to keep your lines more muted in terms of pen pressure and line weight. Keeping it <strong>airy</strong> helps, as we know more will be added over it. I'm mindful of the <strong>pinch and stretch</strong> areas, the pinch on one side and the stretch on the other. I also connect areas like the neck and the rib cage to avoid gaps, where it feels like there's a head levitating above a rib cage.</p>

<h2>Incorporating Landmarks</h2>

<p>Next, I add the <strong>landmarks</strong>. Even if I can't see certain landmarks like the sacrum, I know they are there, so I can guess their placement. I mark the spine, scapula, and pelvis. My landmark indications don't have to be elaborate, just circles, triangles, and straight lines. It's shorthand to help guide me.</p>

<h2>Adding Perspective</h2>

<p>After laying in the landmarks, I consider the <strong>perspective</strong>. It doesn't have to be a complete workup, I just want to know the surfaces so that when I'm studying the muscles, I know which goes where. For this pose, I'm seeing the pelvic box from underneath because of the lean forward. I use the floating ribs on the back to get my framing, and show the rib cage from beneath.</p>

<h2>Working Through the Whole Figure</h2>

<p>One thing I like about having these steps is that it makes me work through the <strong>whole figure</strong>. Sometimes when rendering, I might focus too much on one area, like the head, and neglect the rest. This process forces me to work the entire figure up.</p>

<h2>Adding Muscles</h2>

<p>Now, I can start adding <strong>muscles</strong> on top. I think of the legs as <strong>tumbling shapes</strong>. For example, the gluteus maximus is like a <strong>butterfly</strong> occupying two planes on the pelvis, it goes on the back and another part sweeps down into the outside of the leg. I'm looking for contours relative to the surface.</p>

<p>Even though I'm not showing the boxes from my perspective step, I keep them in mind. By moving my lines across the forms, I <strong>imply</strong> the planes and surfaces, so you become aware of them without literally seeing the boxes.</p>

<h2>Understanding Muscle Shapes and Contours</h2>

<p>I move the lines around into the outside of the femur, showing the break between the gluteus medius and maximus and indicating where the tensor fasciae latae is. Now, I'm defaulting into the patterns of how I remember the muscles.</p>

<p>Every muscle can be started as <strong>one shape</strong>, and then broken into <strong>three</strong>. For the hamstring, I can break it into three shapes, two groups and then the popliteal surface at the bottom where the tendons connect to the lower leg. I begin <strong>simple</strong> and then build to <strong>complex</strong>.</p>

<p>The sartorius forms a curve, giving a rounder, softer line. On the outside, the vastus lateralis with the IT band on top creates a contour bump.</p>

<h2>The Importance of Gesture</h2>

<p>Pause for a second, and think about why we started like this. Now look at all the muscles, the gluteus maximus, quadriceps, hamstrings, they're all doing the <strong>same thing</strong>. This is why I start with <strong>gesture</strong>, it builds a design appreciation for what the contour is supposed to be doing when we finish the muscles at the very end.</p>

<h2>Pinch and Stretch in Muscles</h2>

<p>The calf muscle is another example. On the outside, it's high to the inside low, and the ankle is the reverse, inside high to outside low. This side might look different because it is <strong>stretching</strong>. There's a <strong>gesture even in the muscle</strong> in terms of its shape, shorter and pinched versus longer.</p>

<p>If I get confused or lost with the muscles, I remember that muscles are <strong>tumbling shapes</strong>, especially in the limbs. I can think of them as asymmetrical forms balancing and shifting their way down the figure.</p>

<h2>Rendering and Light Effects</h2>

<p>With the muscles in place, we can think about <strong>rendering</strong>. It's easier to light <strong>geometries</strong> than to light a figure. For example, it's simpler to light a ball with a core shadow and cast shadow. But when rendering the figure, it's essential to understand the <strong>surfaces</strong>.</p>

<p>I enjoy getting a linear appreciation of the surface, as if my pencil is an <strong>ant walking across the topography</strong> of the form. This approach helps me understand the surfaces, and do a better job with light and shadow.</p>

<h2>Combining Gesture with Anatomy</h2>

<p>The muscles of the back, like the spinal erectors, look like <strong>corn dogs</strong> to me. The latissimus dorsi wraps over and adds volume. All my lines are negotiating the forms that already exist, wrapping, overlapping, and adding volumes to the volumes underneath.</p>

<p>The gesture first tells me why, for example, the arm is bent so the tricep needs to be more stretched, or the hand is flexed so the flexors under the forearm need to be more of a <strong>C-curve</strong>.</p>

<h2>Applying the Process to Another Pose</h2>

<p>Let's do one more with a back view, starting the same way with the gesture. I'm looking for all those <strong>shifts in weight</strong>. Now, the shifts in weight are about seeing and understanding what the muscles are doing and why.</p>

<p>The shift working in the gesture from the head to the weight-bearing leg isn't just about the process of getting to the foot, it is about allowing myself to see that the anatomy will look much different here than on the supporting leg.</p>

<p>I add landmarks like the scapulas and connect them with shapes, <strong>pinch and stretch</strong>, to help with the rotation of the forms.</p>

<h2>Focusing on Muscle Patterns</h2>

<p>On this one, I'll focus on the muscle patterns without doing the perspective. Sometimes it's fun to see if you can look for the muscles just for their <strong>2D shapes</strong>.</p>

<h3>Upper Body Muscles</h3>

<p>Starting at the top, the trapezius forms my <strong>dagger</strong> shape. The shoulder is lower on this side, so it's pushed down lower and longer. The arm is raised on the other side, so it's more C-curved and pinched, moving up. The muscle has a <strong>gesture</strong>.</p>

<p>The spinal erectors underneath pull down to the sacrum. The latissimus dorsi on top goes to the front of the arm, it looks like a <strong>wine glass</strong> to me. It's stretching on one side, and higher.</p>

<h3>Arm Muscles</h3>

<p>For the arm, I have the teres major, a little <strong>cigar shape</strong>, and the deltoid over that. Then the tricep ends in the sharper shape for the elbow. Again, the gesture of the muscle in a limb would be like a <strong>drumstick</strong>, but if it's flexed versus extended, I move the mass of the shape higher or lower. If the tricep is extended and straightening the arm forcefully, the ball gets higher and tighter, a <strong>C-curve</strong>. If it's starting to flex, it moves down and it becomes longer.</p>

<h3>Observing Pinch and Stretch</h3>

<p>I'm appreciating how this side of the body is <strong>compressed</strong>, especially around the torso, and that's making an interesting difference to the <strong>expanded</strong> side. The way all this looks is all <strong>S-curves</strong>, the negative shape is open, and the ridge group is pinched.</p>

<h2>Designing Anatomy with Gesture</h2>

<p>I like anatomy to be <strong>designed</strong> because it's hard for me to stay interested in the slower-paced stuff like rendering, I get bored and distracted. By thinking of the anatomy in terms of design and gesture, I can keep it interesting.</p>

<h3>Lower Body Muscles</h3>

<p>For the legs, it's back to the pattern. The gluteus maximus is the <strong>butterfly</strong>, with the medius and greater trochanter. The hamstrings are <strong>tumbling shapes</strong>, remember? The vastus lateralis, adductor, sartorius, IT band, and calf all form into the popliteal surface between the hamstrings.</p>

<p>The ankle goes from high to low, that's also a <strong>gesture</strong>. The flexed leg has everything higher, and I can push on the bottom of the shape of the gluteus maximus. My shapes and design reflect the gesture.</p>

<p>After my setup, I can focus more on the <strong>surface</strong>. Sometimes I'm interested in the cool rim light on the gluteus maximus, the light to shadow transition. How does that happen? The muscle is flexed, and that's where the height of the muscle changes, goes across, and turns in.</p>

<h2>Rendering with Understanding</h2>

<p>When people ask me about rendering, I tell them that <strong>this is rendering</strong>. The fault in rendering is that it never connects the surface to light effects. It's always just a passive recording of the flat surface of an image, like a photograph. Rendering, to me, means knowing why there's a light source. The only reason we can truly appreciate or understand the light source is to <strong>know the surface of a form</strong>. This is my version of rendering.</p>

<h2>The Roadmap Ahead</h2>

<p>I hope this gives you a little bit of a roadmap for how to think about directions to take this in the future. Keep in mind that not everybody would need this level of detail. If you're a storyboard artist, they might not want anatomy, gesture might be all you need. The positioning of a mannequin that's expressive and communicates an emotion or an idea about someone's mood with multiple angles could be sufficient.</p>

<p>If you're looking for something that allows you to create a more <strong>sculptural</strong> or <strong>rendered figure</strong>, this is my workflow for taking the stick figure gesture or the rhythmic gesture and slowly building it up into something that can allow you an investigation of anatomy. But it is a very <strong>analytical approach</strong>. It's a lot about, for a very long time, drawing what you know so that you can make the transition into observing those light and shadow patterns and allowing you to have greater design control over them.</p>
