<h2>Eye Level and the Horizon Line</h2>

<p>When drawing in perspective, choose your viewer's <strong>eye level</strong>, which is the same as the <strong>horizon line</strong>. This line sets your viewpoint height, and it affects all other lines in your drawing.</p>

<h2>Receding Lines: Up Views and Down Views</h2>

<p>Use three sets of lines for the spatial axes. When receding lines <strong>aim up</strong>, you're looking <strong>down</strong> at the object, and when they <strong>aim down</strong>, you're looking <strong>up</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Remember:</strong></p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Looking down, lines go up</strong></li>

<li><strong>Looking up, lines go down</strong></li>

</ul>

<h2>Vanishing Points and Perspective Types</h2>

<ul>

<li><strong>One-Point Perspective</strong>: One set of lines recedes to a single point.</li>

<li><strong>Two-Point Perspective</strong>: Two sets of lines recede to two points.</li>

<li><strong>Three-Point Perspective</strong>: Vertical lines tilt and recede to a third point.</li>

</ul>

<p>Vertical lines parallel to the picture plane don't need a vanishing point. In three-point perspective, artists often adjust the third point for effect.</p>

<h2>Focus on Spatial Axes</h2>

<p>Understanding the <strong>three spatial axes</strong>, width, height, and depth, is more important than labeling perspectives. Know how lines recede and converge, and accurately depict forms.</p>

<h2>Foreshortening and Angles</h2>

<p>As objects approach eye level, their top and bottom planes <strong>foreshorten</strong>, and angles change:</p>

<ol>

<li><strong>Angles on Paper</strong>: Corners shift from acute to obtuse angles.</li>

<li><strong>Position Changes</strong>: Objects compress into lines when aligned with your eye level.</li>

</ol>

<h2>Practice Drawing</h2>

<ul>

<li><strong>Draw rooms</strong> with the eye level centered.</li>

<li><strong>Start with 5-minute sketches</strong>, then reduce to 3 minutes, then 1 minute.</li>

<li><strong>Observe</strong> how lines converge toward vanishing points on the horizon.</li>

</ul>

<h2>The Picture Plane</h2>

<p>Understanding the <strong>picture plane</strong> explains foreshortening. As objects align with your eye, they compress. This concept solves many perspective problems.</p>

<h2>Skill-Building Project</h2>

<ul>

<li><strong>Sketch examples</strong> repeatedly, this helps to internalize concepts. <strong>30 times</strong> and you'll get it, <strong>50 times</strong> and you'll never forget.</li>

<li><strong>Redraw scenes</strong> with higher or lower eye levels. Observe how the lines aiming toward the horizon change angles.</li>

<li><strong>Maintain proportions</strong>. Forms don't change, only the angles of the lines do.</li>

</ul>

<p><strong>Remember:</strong></p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Looking down, lines go up</strong></li>

<li><strong>Looking up, lines go down</strong></li>

</ul>
