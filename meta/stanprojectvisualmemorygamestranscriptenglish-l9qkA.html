<h2>Why Visual Memory Is Important</h2>

<p>Developing your <strong>visual memory</strong> helps you <strong>draw from imagination</strong>, <strong>draw faster</strong>, be more creative, and even improves your ability to <strong>draw from observation</strong>. Artists like Karl Kopinski, Kim Jung Gi, Peter Han, and Eliza Ivanova excel due to their extraordinary visual memory.</p>

<h2>Visual Memory Games</h2>

<p><strong>Draw from Memory</strong>: Study a reference for a minute or two, then hide it and draw from memory. Gradually decrease your viewing time as you improve. After drawing, check your accuracy and try again to see improvement.</p>

<p><strong>Draw from a Different Angle</strong>: Without hiding the reference, draw the subject from a different angle. This enhances your ability to visualize.</p>

<p><strong>Combine Them</strong>: Study the subject, then draw it from memory and from a different angle. Starting with a study drawing can help you learn the forms before drawing from memory.</p>

<p><strong>Level Two – Change Proportions</strong>: Using figure references, draw from a different angle, from memory, and alter the proportions. Use the reference as inspiration to redesign and create your own version.</p>

<p><strong>Bonus Game – Draw Moving Subjects</strong>: Observe a moving subject, like animals at the zoo. Memorize a pose and draw it while the subject continues to move. This challenges you to work with what you've got.</p>

<h2>Assignments</h2>

<p><strong>Level One</strong>: Using provided 3D models, choose from the first three games. Focus on practicing <strong>perspective</strong> and construct forms from simple shapes. Use the interactive models to check your work by adjusting the angles.</p>

<p><strong>Level Two</strong>: Work from figure photos and choose any of the four games, including changing proportions. Simplify poses into mannequins using basic forms like boxes, cylinders, and spheres.</p>

<p>Remember, you can continue these memory games anytime to enhance your visual memory. You can focus on gesture, shapes, colors, shadows—whatever you like.</p>
