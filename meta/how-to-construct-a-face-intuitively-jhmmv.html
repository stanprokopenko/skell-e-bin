<h2>General Approach to Drawing Features</h2>

<p>When drawing facial features, focus on a <strong>softer interpretation</strong> of features and their placement. Maintain the same parts perspective setup throughout the drawing. Use <strong>hatching</strong> primarily to maintain a sense of play rather than heavy light and shadow.</p>

<h2>Drawing the Eye</h2>

<ol>

<li><strong>Place the eye shape</strong> and consider moving the nose if necessary.</li>

<li>Consider the <strong>canthal ligament</strong> and how it attaches.</li>

<li>Think about the <strong>center split</strong> and how it interacts with the eye.</li>

<li>Start with an <strong>average plane</strong> and build up or down for thickness.</li>

<li><strong>Wrap a band</strong> across a ball or a long box across a ball, developing a corner on it.</li>

<li>Combine the <strong>plate, fat, and skin</strong> to create a fuller shape.</li>

<li>Observe how <strong>light and shadow</strong> react to the fuller shape.</li>

<li>Interpret the shape as a <strong>spiral or twisting plane</strong> pushing back into the face.</li>

<li>Consider the <strong>top of the brow area</strong> and its exaggerated structure.</li>

<li>Look for the <strong>eyebrow</strong> and think about it in perspective.</li>

<li>Move across the face and adjust features like the <strong>keystone and saddle</strong>.</li>

<li>Finish the eye by placing the <strong>ellipse of the iris and pupil</strong>.</li>

<li>Use a <strong>target to place the gaze</strong> and ensure eyes are aligned.</li>

<li>Design the <strong>lower lid</strong> to reflect the presence of the eye.</li>

<li>Connect <strong>plane and value</strong> to lead into shading.</li>

</ol>

<h2>Drawing the Nose</h2>

<ol>

<li>Transition to the nose by considering the <strong>drop back of the socket</strong> and the curve up to the saddle.</li>

<li>Understand the <strong>plane of the nose</strong> and its cartilage.</li>

<li>Use <strong>highlights</strong> to indicate plane changes.</li>

<li>Develop the nose by considering the <strong>septum and the under plane</strong>.</li>

<li>Think about the <strong>malar fat</strong> and how it spreads across the face.</li>

<li>Consider the <strong>denture sphere</strong> and its form line.</li>

<li>Observe the <strong>sharp change</strong> at the end of the nose and the highlight area.</li>

<li>Work inside the <strong>under plane of the nose</strong> and consider the septum's flow.</li>

<li>Use lines to respond to the plane and avoid overthinking.</li>

<li>Develop the <strong>nostril</strong> and its depth and thickness.</li>

<li>Make <strong>plane differences clear</strong> to show the buildup of perspective.</li>

<li>Consider <strong>cast and form shadows</strong> in light and shadow relationships.</li>

</ol>

<h2>Drawing the Mouth</h2>

<ol>

<li>Think about the <strong>parts of the mouth</strong> and their relation to other features.</li>

<li>Relate the mouth to the <strong>denture sphere and cheek</strong>.</li>

<li>Develop the <strong>philtrum shape</strong> and its relation to the ball.</li>

<li>Consider the <strong>lower lip's forward and back movement</strong>.</li>

<li>Think about the <strong>chin's perspective form</strong> and its projection.</li>

<li>Push the chin in and curve it for a <strong>less boxy look</strong>.</li>

<li>Revisit and adjust features for <strong>proportion and placement</strong>.</li>

</ol>

<h2>Additional Considerations</h2>

<ol>

<li>Consider <strong>larger deposits of fat</strong> and their impact on the face.</li>

<li>Design the <strong>ear</strong> with basic shapes and planes.</li>

<li>Think about the ear's <strong>internal structure</strong> and its relation to the head.</li>

<li>Address <strong>contours from the head to the neck</strong>.</li>

<li>Check shapes around the mouth and consider <strong>muscles of chewing</strong>.</li>

<li>Use the <strong>masseter muscle</strong> to add form to the back of the jaw.</li>

<li>Develop an understanding of <strong>surface and exaggeration</strong> of features.</li>

<li>Prepare the drawing for more concrete ideas of <strong>lighting and rendering</strong>.</li>

<li>Focus on connecting the <strong>understructure, surface development, and architecture</strong> of the skull.</li>

<li>Build an understanding of the <strong>form of features</strong> and their complex surfaces.</li>
