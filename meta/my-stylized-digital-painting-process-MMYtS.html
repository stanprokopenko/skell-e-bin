<p>Hey, how you doing? I'm Ben Elin, and I like to draw, paint, and sculpt, particularly in a more stylized way. Today, I'm going to talk about one of the ways I like to digitally paint, the process I take to bring an illustration from sketch to a somewhat finished rendering.</p>

<p>We're going to:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Start with a sketch</strong></li>

<li><strong>Add values, slowly building them up</strong></li>

<li><strong>Use layer modes to add color on top</strong>, think of it almost like a black and white to color process</li>

<li><strong>Merge all the layers down and then paint on top</strong></li>

</ul>

<p>I hope you're going to enjoy it. It's going to be a lot of fun. Let's get stuck into it.</p>

<h2>Starting the Sketch</h2>

<p>The first thing I want to do is focus on the <strong>largest shapes</strong>. We've got a kind of funny-looking guy here, he's smiling, but in a menacing way. We can play around with some of the expressions as we go. But I want to really focus on the largest shapes possible.</p>

<p>We're going to have some fun, <strong>stylizing these shapes</strong>. I'm not going for likeness here, that is a key point. There's a bit of a different process if I'm going for likeness, I'll really take my time with some of these shapes and make sure that I nail all the little feature shapes. But today, we're just going to have some fun, and kind of invent a character. I might just make his neck huge here. We'll just have fun. There's no stress.</p>

<p>So here are the larger shapes that we've got. Once we've got the larger shapes, then we want to start looking at the next step down in shape size within the head itself.</p>

<h3>Considering the Head Angle</h3>

<p>One thing we've got to take into account is the <strong>head angle</strong>. The head's tilted down, right? So oftentimes when that happens, the ears are going to be sitting a little bit higher on the head. We've got to make sure that we keep an eye on that brow and the tilt of that overarching shape.</p>

<p>So now we're starting to think a little bit in 3D, but still trying to keep those shapes as simple as possible.</p>

<h3>Adding Features</h3>

<p>I'm just going to add in teeth, or just the indication of the teeth. Maybe this is like massive, it's like creepy. Sometimes I do end up making these faces, so if you see me going like that, don't be alarmed. I'm fine. I'm just trying to feel the character, you know, it's just a habit, but it kind of helps in a way.</p>

<p>Even though I'm doing a little bit of shading here, I'm still thinking about these as simple 2D shapes, trying to show the form as best we can.</p>

<p>I might do some larger eyes and how they would fit into the sockets. We've got to keep an eye on that, no pun intended. So we're doing the eyes, they sit in the sockets. We've got the eyebrows.</p>

<h2>Refining the Sketch</h2>

<p>Now, this layer, I'm going to <strong>knock back</strong>, and when I say knock back, I mean reduce the opacity, so that this just gives us that kind of ghosting look. Then we can go over and do some refinements, just clean up our line work.</p>

<p>There's no set number of these iterations. Sometimes I'll knock this out in three and I'll be happy with the line work. Sometimes I'll go to 25 or 30 if I'm having a particularly frustrating day. So don't feel like you have to copy exactly what I'm doing. I've had a lot of experience. But if you're just starting out, have some patience with yourself and do this knocking back, drawing over the top, knocking back, drawing over the top as much as you think you need to.</p>

<h3>Consolidating Lines</h3>

<p>What I'm looking for in this process of going over the top of my previous line work is that a lot of the underlying lines are pretty sketchy. I'm trying to <strong>consolidate them into a more confident line</strong>. I'm making decisions here. I'm not just sort of going over my previous sketches necessarily. I'm refining both the line work and my thinking.</p>

<p>For example, I don't really have a clear idea of what these brows are doing, they're just kind of indicated here. So I might just come in and refine. Now I know that these other features are kind of falling into place, I can refine this brow and add the eyebrow there.</p>

<p>We're still inventing, we're still adding things. You don't have to have everything sorted out in the layer below. This is what this whole process is for. It's about <strong>iteration</strong>, which is fun. You get to explore, change, and test things out.</p>

<p>Maybe he has glasses, you know? We can just quickly throw that in there. Does that fit the character at all? It kind of looks cool if I'm honest, but I think I might leave it for this one. But you get the idea.</p>

<h3>Using the Lasso Tool</h3>

<p>All I did there was use the <strong>Lasso Tool</strong>. The Lasso Tool is fantastic, and it's pretty ubiquitous across all digital painting software. It's a great little thing just to be able to circle around something and move it.</p>

<h2>Flipping the Canvas</h2>

<p>Throughout this whole process, I'm going to be <strong>flipping the canvas</strong>. Why do we flip the canvas? The main reason is you get to see it from a different vantage point. If you're working traditionally, some people will even take photos and flip the photo. Some people will look at it through a mirror.</p>

<p>It's sort of like a tried-and-true way of getting a different perspective on your work. Because if you're just working on the same thing over and over again, the little issues start to become harder and harder to identify.</p>

<p>So a quick tip, I've got the shortcut <strong>Control+F</strong>. I recommend key binding it, so you can do that. But if you want to do it manually, you just come up to <strong>View</strong>, and then you go <strong>Flip Horizontal</strong>. You can see I just made a little shortcut, Control+F, that's what I like.</p>

<p>Sometimes you get lucky and it looks okay, sometimes we need to do some work and move some things around.</p>

<h2>Iterating and Refining</h2>

<p>So I think we'll just start doing some surgery. <strong>Command+T</strong> to manipulate, and holding <strong>Control</strong> down, you can kind of move bits and pieces that you've selected around. It's not terrible, but it is a tad bit wonky, like it's all head.</p>

<p>I don't worry too much at this stage about changing anything and getting it just so, because I'll change the eyes later on if I need to. And that's a key thing as well: I'm personally <strong>not afraid to make massive sweeping changes</strong> at any point throughout this process.</p>

<p>If we come to the end in the rendering phase, hopefully it's looking okay, but if something isn't looking right, I'm really not afraid to just completely get rid of it and start again. Not necessarily going through this whole process again. Let's say if we're at the painting stage, just knock it out. But what we'll do is, if we do come to that, we'll do a <strong>duplicate layer</strong>, and that means we've almost got a saved version for ourselves. And that's the beauty of digital, you can just <strong>iterate and iterate and iterate</strong>.</p>

<p>You're going to hear me say "iterate" a lot at this stage It can help just to indicate some values, not get too nitty-gritty, but try and get all the value steps and refinements in there. But it's also good seeing, I tend to like to see in value and more so just for the shadow. So I might just throw down a shadow pattern, like for example here, of the chin.</p>

<h3>Understanding Planes and Forms</h3>

<p>From this step, we could go one of two ways. We could do one more refinement stage to really lock in some of these shapes, or we could keep it a little bit sketchier to give it more like an organic feeling. Because sometimes if you go through this process, you can go as far as you want with tightness and rendering wise, you can make it look like a 3D model if you really wanted to. But there's a sliding scale with that.</p>

<p>You could go a little bit more sketchy and a little bit more loose, which is probably going to be erring on the side of what we're going to do today. Or you could really spend the time, days and days and days, really understanding the values and getting those transitions just so. It's a really nice little versatile workflow, depending on what you're going for.</p>

<p>He's looking a little bit boss-eyed at the moment, so we're just going to tweak some of this stuff.</p>

<p>One of the ways that this process benefits me is because I really like to work in <strong>big graphical shapes</strong>, really large, stylistic, fun, funky, sort of chunky shapes. And in doing that, it really gives me a nice foundation to add light and shadow on these larger forms. Then I can build up the detail from those larger shapes. It's a fun process for this kind of style, I guess you could say.</p>

<h3>Making Adjustments</h3>

<p>At this stage, I think we might go one more round of iteration. You might want to move on at this point, feel free, but I'm just going to do one more little pass at refining some of these lines. Zoom in a tad bit more.</p>

<p>Let's really think about this, okay, where is this nostril going to be? So this is where we might have a little bit more refinement with our thinking, with our line work. Understanding where the <strong>planes</strong>, the faces of an object, are. For example, this here might be a separate plane, this plane of the forehead.</p>

<p>So I'm thinking in this way as well, I'm not as explicit as this, but there'll be different planes of, say, the nose here. These might be facing more upwards than these sort of planes, they might be facing that way. So I'm kind of thinking about this, trying to map it out a little bit in my head, and then we can come on top and then add whatever lighting scenario that we want to this.</p>

<p>With this refining pass, I'm trying to <strong>tie together some of the more ambiguous decisions</strong> that I've made, flipping back between that 2D and 3D thinking.</p>

<h3>Adding Character Details</h3>

<p>With this nose here, I'm both trying to think about the shape, what would make sense here? Like, should I have it a little bit smaller? So like, it's a little bit of a smaller kind of nose. Does that fit the character? Or because I've got his head tilted down, do we want to even overlap the mouth a little bit and have a little bit of a chunky nose?</p>

<p>But this is the thing, it doesn't matter. This is just a random character. Have fun with it. Try and have fun with it and don't get too caught up on getting it just so, because there were many years where I did that.</p>

<p>It is a very fine line with the eyes, it's out by like a millimeter sometimes. It's like, okay, the other looks angry or very confused. I might even want him to look at the camera. But what we can do here is we can tweak, imagine the eyes as a <strong>sphere</strong> as well. Helps a lot when you're placing the eyes, regardless of his head direction. His eyes might be facing the camera a little bit more.</p>

<p>Those nostrils are going to be kind of flared out a little bit because his mouth is open, which is going to affect a lot of the face here with the mouth.</p>

<p>We can give him really proper teeth, like straight teeth, and really he's gone to the dentist. His parents paid for his orthodontist appointments. Or we can give him some gnarly, maybe there's some missing. He might be like a boxer. That could be part of the character as well. Let's do that. Let's give him a little bit of interest, so we can really make it fit.</p>

<p>Some indication of the gums is always fun. Just these little arrows give enough of an indication for that kind of thing. And then we can refine that when we come to painting.</p>

<h3>Ears and Other Details</h3>

<p>Quick little tip with the ears, I like to think of them as <strong>cylinders</strong>, kind of disc-shaped cylinders. So we can think of that, the cylinder shape. It is a bit of an oblong kind of cylinder, but at its core, that's what I'm thinking about.</p>

<p>Have that neck down here. This has given us a nice little foundation, all the way from this initial really rough sketch to this, which is the whole purpose of it.</p>

<h2>Moving to Values</h2>

<p>I think that we could even leave it here, more or less, and then we can start to tackle values. But if this is going to be a line work specific drawing, take as long as you need. There's no set amount of time. Even for myself, it varies. This is kind of coming together fairly quickly, but sometimes it doesn't, and it's not as straightforward, which I'm sure some of you have had some experience with. I certainly have.</p>

<p>At this stage, we've got our little note that the tooth is going to be knocked out. We've got where our cranium is going to be, where a bit of that hairline might sit. I think we can take this into the value stage.</p>

<p>So now we've got this sketch. The things that I'm looking for before moving onto the next phase are <strong>a clear understanding of the shape and form</strong>, basically. Because I really like to think in three dimensions. So as long as I've got that, I think you're good to go and move on.</p>

<p>That can mean different things for different people. But basically, this is giving us a foundation to build on top of as we move through the next phases.</p>
