<h2>What's in Premium?</h2>

<p>In this premium lesson, you'll learn techniques for drawing diggers and characters using simple shapes:</p>

<ul>

<li>

<p><strong>Drawing Diggers with Blobs</strong>: Start by sketching side and front views of a digger, then use blobs to represent its three-dimensional form.</p>

</li>

<li>

<p><strong>Defining Planes with Rubber Bands</strong>: Apply rubber bands around blobs to indicate front, top, and side planes, helping you visualize how different planes relate in 3D space.</p>

</li>

<li>

<p><strong>Exploring Perspectives</strong>: Practice drawing diggers from various angles, including upward and downward views, and learn how lines move away from the viewer.</p>

</li>

<li>

<p><strong>Combining Multiple Perspectives</strong>: Understand how to integrate objects with different orientations and vanishing points in one scene.</p>

</li>

<li>

<p><strong>Character Design with Blobs</strong>: Use blobs and the rubber band technique to design characters, enhancing their three-dimensionality and depth.</p>

</li>

<li>

<p><strong>Overcoming Creative Blocks</strong>: Learn methods like sketching various ideas and using orthographic views to clarify shapes and proportions.</p>

</li>

</ul>

<p>This lesson expands your skills in form, perspective, and character creation.</p>
