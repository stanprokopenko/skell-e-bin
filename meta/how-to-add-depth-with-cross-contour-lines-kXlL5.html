<h2>What Are Cross Contours and Why Are They Important?</h2>

<p>If you've ever struggled drawing things that feel three-dimensional, <strong>cross contours</strong> could be a game changer for you. They're super helpful for <strong>constructing forms</strong>, shading details, and they help you get better at <strong>visualizing your drawings in 3D</strong>.</p>

<p>We know that boxes are made of planes, but what if the thing you want to draw is organic or more complicated than a box? The good news is that you can apply this concept of planes onto any form. Now, I don't mean to actually draw all these little planes, but you need to start <strong>imagining them</strong>. Imagine this wireframe wrapping around the form.</p>

<p>It takes some time to train your mind to switch from thinking about the <strong>contour</strong> or the outlines to thinking about <strong>cross contours</strong> or the forms. The goal is to imagine the form and then <strong>draw a few key cross contours</strong> that help communicate that form.</p>

<h2>Visualizing Forms with Ant Trails</h2>

<p>If the idea of imagining an entire 3D wireframe sounds intimidating or impossible to you right now, that's okay. That's the goal, eventually. For now, you can start by <strong>imagining one cross contour line at a time</strong>. You pick a spot and imagine an <strong>ant trail</strong>. If a colony of ants marched across this form, what would that trail look like?</p>

<h3>Drawing Simple Forms</h3>

<p>Let's draw a sausage. The <strong>contour outline</strong> doesn't tell us much about the 3D qualities of this sausage. The little knots on the end help, but we assume that the sausage is cylindrical only by context. You already know what a sausage looks like, but if you're drawing something a little more complicated or new to the viewer, you want to <strong>describe the 3D qualities of a form</strong>.</p>

<p>So, an <strong>ellipse</strong> as a cross contour creates the illusion that this sausage has thickness and that it's a rounded thickness like a cylinder. But what if it's a banana? We need to show these <strong>hard edges</strong>. Without them, it doesn't look like a banana—more like a croissant or a potato. The way you describe the form on the inside can be really important and becomes even more important when you're drawing something more complicated than a banana, like a face or a torso.</p>

<h2>Spacing of Cross Contour Lines</h2>

<h3>How Far Apart Should You Draw Them?</h3>

<p>Let's talk about <strong>spacing</strong>. How far apart should you draw these cross contour lines? I typically like to draw <strong>one to three cross contour lines per chunk of a form</strong>. It depends on the size on the page and how much the form changes throughout. The purpose of the cross contour line is to describe the form at that slice.</p>

<p>On a section of the forearm, you might do two cross contour lines. One at the wrist, which is a little bit more boxy and bony so that the top is flatter, the side is flatter, and it'll have <strong>sharper corners like a box</strong>. Then, as you get towards the meaty area, this will be a little bit more <strong>rounded like a cylinder</strong>.</p>

<h3>Indicating Foreshortening with Spacing</h3>

<p>There's another thing to keep in mind. The <strong>spacing relationships</strong> can actually indicate some <strong>foreshortening</strong>. If you look at a roly-poly from the side view, the little segments on the roly-poly are pretty evenly spaced out. But if you look at it from a different point of view, those measurements are getting <strong>smaller</strong> as they go away from you. These planes are <strong>foreshortened</strong>. The planes that we're looking directly at appear larger.</p>

<p>Cross contours don't have to indicate even segments throughout a form, but when you're trying to show foreshortening, you can use that spacing to inform the viewer that certain parts are going away from us and the spacing is closer.</p>

<h4>Example: Drawing a Roly-Poly in Three-Quarter View</h4>

<p>For example, let's draw this roly-poly from a three-quarter angle. Instead of looking at it from the side, we're seeing mostly the front bottom part and a little bit of the side. This whole part is moving away from us. The segments that are closer to us will have <strong>wider spacing</strong>, while the segments that are moving away will have <strong>narrower spacing</strong>.</p>

<p>You can use these distances to show that the form is going away from us. You can see how that <strong>spacing really does communicate some depth</strong>.</p>

<h2>The Curviness of Cross Contour Lines</h2>

<h3>Deciding How Curvy to Make Them</h3>

<p>Now, what about the <strong>curviness</strong>? We know that the shape you use for the cross contour describes the form. With the banana, we saw that it had some <strong>sharp edges</strong>. The sausage had an <strong>ellipse</strong>. But not every ellipse is the same. Some curves are going to be <strong>very round</strong>; some are going to be a little bit <strong>flatter</strong>. So how do you decide how curvy to make it?</p>

<p>There are two things to keep in mind. Let's say you're drawing a fish, and you're going to simplify this fish. If you draw an ellipse that's kind of <strong>flat</strong>, you're describing a pretty <strong>flat fish</strong>. If you draw another fish with a more <strong>rounded</strong> cross contour, you're indicating that this fish is <strong>fatter</strong> in the middle part.</p>

<p>When you're drawing these cross contour lines, you can't just say, "Oh, it's round; I'm just gonna put some ellipse there." You really have to <strong>think about the curviness of the ellipse</strong>.</p>

<h3>Considering the Viewer's Angle</h3>

<p>The orientation of the object will make a difference in how curvy that line should be. If you draw this fatter fish straight on, looking directly at you, the cross contour will be <strong>very wide</strong>. But if you draw the fish in perfect side view, the cross contours will be <strong>straight lines down</strong> because you need a little bit of that rotation for these to be able to go around.</p>

<p>Everything in between will go from a straight line to a very rounded part. It just depends on how much you're looking at it straight on to see the widest belly versus how much you're looking at it from the side.</p>

<h4>Example: Drawing a Macaroni</h4>

<p>Now, let's look at the same concept but with a <strong>macaroni</strong>. If we're looking at it from different orientations, the cross contours will change.</p>

<ul>

<li>When viewing the macaroni from one end, the middle part will appear larger because it's closer to us. The cross contour lines at the ends are going to get <strong>rounder and closer together</strong> because they're wrapping around away from us.</li>

<li>From the other side, the middle part is farther away, so the cross contour lines will curve in the opposite direction. The ends are still <strong>rounder and closer together</strong>.</li>

</ul>

<p>You can see all these things happening at the same time—the <strong>distances getting shorter</strong>, the <strong>amount of curviness changing</strong>, and the <strong>direction of the curves</strong>.</p>

<h2>Avoiding Common Mistakes with the Ends</h2>

<h3>Don't Be Lazy with the Ends</h3>

<p>Here's a really important tip: <strong>Don't be lazy with the ends</strong>. Remember that these lines have to <strong>wrap all the way around</strong>. The ends are usually going to have the <strong>most curve</strong>, and the mistake most people make is they actually make the ends the flattest parts. They try to add the curvature right in the middle and then flatten the ends.</p>

<p>If you make the ends flat, you're implying that the form has sudden sharp corners or is flat at the ends. You're showing that it's up and then suddenly back down. To show that it's <strong>slowly wrapping around</strong>, you have to make sure the ends have that curvature.</p>

<p>You can train yourself to think about those ends by ghosting in the line all the way around or lightly drawing a line all the way around, but make sure it's light so that it doesn't distract from the actual lines that are in front. Even just adding a little piece is enough to show that it's wrapping around.</p>

<h2>Cross Contours Around All Three Axes</h2>

<p>We can have contours around <strong>all three axes</strong>. So far, I've drawn contours along the length of a form, but you can actually show cross contour lines along any of the three axes—or all three if you want to be really detailed with it.</p>

<p>For example, we can show an ant marching along the side of a form, wrapping around, and coming back. This shows that we're seeing the side plane here and the other side plane there. This cross contour line informs us of a really important piece of information.</p>

<h3>Imagining a Wireframe</h3>

<p>You can imagine a wireframe around a blob form, showing cross contours along the length, width, and depth. This creates a very three-dimensional wireframe around the blob. It helps you—and the viewer—understand the form in a more detailed way.</p>

<h2>Using Center Lines</h2>

<h3>Center Lines and Orientation</h3>

<p>Some things are going to have an obvious <strong>center line</strong>, like right down the face or running down the middle of the torso. Sometimes these center lines are a great place to show <strong>gesture</strong>, like in the motion of the torso. But sometimes it's an opportunity to think of the form with a cross contour.</p>

<p>Remember how earlier in the course, Aaron Blaise showed that center line on a sphere for a round bear head. The center line is a good trick, and it's really easy to understand, and it was really useful for him to then attach the muzzle.</p>

<h3>Drawing a Head Looking Up</h3>

<p>Think of a little potato head dude looking up and to the left. The center line would be off-center, and you'd see a little bit of the bottom. You're going to make sure that the center line <strong>wraps around the bottom</strong>. That already implies that we're seeing the bottom, and this person is looking up.</p>

<p>You can further support that idea with a kind of a rubber band around the sides. Some people use this to imply the brow ridge or the level of the eyes. Since this person is looking up, you're going to be seeing a cross contour like this.</p>

<p>Now these two lines make it way easier for you to place your features. You've got the nose pointing up, the ears are going to be lower, and you can place the eyes accordingly. Now you've got a little potato head dude!</p>

<p>You can keep thinking of all the forms going down as little blobs. So the neck attaches to this. Since we're looking up at it, we're going to see it attach right along there. Even the torso could be a blob form. If you're drawing cartoon characters, blobs are really all you need.</p>

<h3>Twisting Forms</h3>

<p>Center lines are useful, but something that might trick us a little bit is when our center lines <strong>twist</strong>. Like if this person was twisting, that center line isn't as simple as a C-curve anymore.</p>

<p>Let's say you have a torso that looks like a bean shape. What if one side faces one way, but the other side faces the other way? The center line here is going to be an <strong>S-curve</strong>. You can reinforce this with the proper overlaps too.</p>

<p>You're thinking about how the side planes wrap around and become the contour. If one side is going one way and the other side is going another way, you have to show that twist in your cross contours.</p>

<h2>Levels of Simplicity</h2>

<h3>Simplifying Cross Contours</h3>

<p>Cross contour lines can represent a <strong>simplified version of the form</strong>, and they usually do. Cross contour lines don't have to follow all the hills and ditches of the details. For example, on a face, we rarely go over the nose and the lips—just a curve for that simplified version of the head.</p>

<h3>Balancing Simplicity and Detail</h3>

<p>How much to simplify? That's up to you as the artist. I like to strike a balance between keeping it simple but not losing any <strong>important details</strong>. Remember what happens when we <strong>oversimplify a banana</strong>.</p>

<p>It also depends on the purpose. Quick sketches or the initial stages of a drawing can be oversimplified because that's the point. You can draw an arm as a cylinder at first because you know that later on in the drawing, after you have the gesture and the proportions figured out, you can come back in and figure out the smaller forms within.</p>

<p>But even as you put in those smaller forms, you're still considering that <strong>major form</strong> that those details will conform to. The cross contours of the muscles still need to feel like they're wrapping around a cylindrical arm. A common mistake is to forget about that major form and <strong>flatten it with the details</strong>.</p>

<h2>Shading with Cross Contour Lines</h2>

<p>Shading is coming up in the next section of this course. We're going to learn a lot about shading, but having a good understanding of cross contour lines is going to come in handy. When you do detailed shading, you're usually pulling your strokes <strong>across the form</strong>. So the shading isn't just about the tones, but how you can use your <strong>shading lines to describe the 3D form</strong>.</p>

<p>When done effectively, these <strong>cross contour-based shading lines</strong> can create an amazingly powerful illusion of depth.</p>
