<p>In this lesson, we'll explore <strong>coronal</strong>, <strong>sagittal</strong>, and <strong>transverse</strong> sections. These are essential concepts for understanding form and perspective in art.</p>

<h2>The Theory Behind Axes and Sections</h2>

<p>Each <strong>axis</strong> is a single dimension, a line. When we consider two dimensions, we create a <strong>plane</strong>, which can be a <strong>section</strong>. Understanding how these axes and planes work together helps us build form.</p>

<h2>The Three Planes</h2>

<h3>Sagittal Plane</h3>

<p>The <strong>sagittal plane</strong> is a side view, it is looking along the <strong>X-axis</strong>. Its planes move along <strong>Y</strong> and <strong>Z</strong>. The sagittal plane separates <strong>left and right</strong>, making a vertical section, a slice through the object from front to back.</p>

<h3>Coronal Plane</h3>

<p>The <strong>coronal plane</strong> looks along the <strong>Z-axis</strong>. Its planes move along <strong>X</strong> and <strong>Y</strong>. The coronal plane divides the object into <strong>front and back</strong>, another vertical section slicing from side to side.</p>

<h3>Transverse Plane</h3>

<p>The <strong>transverse plane</strong> is seen along the <strong>Y-axis</strong>. Its planes move along <strong>X</strong> and <strong>Z</strong>. The transverse plane separates <strong>above and below</strong>, creating a horizontal section.</p>

<h2>Building Form with Sections</h2>

<p>We're learning how to build form by assembling these sections at right angles to each other. When you use these planes in combination, the world and everything in it takes on form.</p>

<p>We started with one axis and moved into two dimensions to create planes and sections. By stacking and orienting these sections properly, you can master the construction of complex forms in perspective.</p>

<h2>Remembering the Names</h2>

<p>While the names are important, what's more crucial is your <strong>awareness</strong> of these planes and how they function. Here are some imaginative ways to remember them:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Sagittal Plane</strong>: Think of a <strong>vertical credit card plane</strong> slicing through the object from front to back.</li>

<li><strong>Coronal Plane</strong>: Imagine a <strong>crown from the front</strong>, like the <strong>corona of the sun</strong> blazing around a person's head.</li>

<li><strong>Transverse Plane</strong>: Visualize a <strong>beautiful pool of water</strong> slicing horizontally through the object.</li>

</ul>

<p>If these analogies help you understand the three ways we can slice a section that stays at right angles to the other two sections, then you've got it.</p>

<h2>Practice and Mastery</h2>

<p>Now it's time to put this knowledge into practice. <strong>Memorize these sections</strong> and <strong>draw from them</strong> using your simple form studies. They'll lead you to mastery of more complex and organic forms, one slice at a time.</p>
