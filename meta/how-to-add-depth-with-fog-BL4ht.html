<h2>Capturing the Cool of Night with Deep Blues</h2>

<p>In this piece, I wanted to capture the <strong>cool of night</strong> using <strong>deep blues</strong>. The foreground has a really dark blue, and there's a lot of atmosphere to play with. I aimed to achieve a transition by incorporating the classic setup of <strong>foreground</strong>, <strong>mid-ground</strong>, and <strong>background</strong>.</p>

<h2>Using Foreground, Mid-ground, and Background</h2>

<p>This classic layering technique helps create depth in the scene. By adding fog, I enhanced the separation between these layers. <strong>Fog is such a powerful tool for illustration</strong> that it's used over and over again. I believe it's important not to shy away from tried and true tools like fog in pursuit of originality.</p>

<h2>The Power of Fog in Illustration</h2>

<p>Fog creates a sense of depth and atmosphere that's hard to achieve otherwise. In this piece, I used heavy fog to separate the layers and give a sense of distance. The fog transitions from the foreground to the background, helping to guide the viewer's eye through the scene.</p>

<h2>Experimenting with Pools of Light</h2>

<p>I wanted to experiment with where to place a <strong>pool of light</strong> in the scene. The reference image had light coming from a street lamp, so I considered whether the light would come from a lamp on the front of the building or elsewhere. I thought about adding lit windows to draw attention to the house.</p>

<h2>Adding Light Sources to Draw Attention</h2>

<p>I decided to paint some window light, to make the house stand out. To create a focal point, I added a lamp near the stairs, a little lamp post right by the entrance. This <strong>draws our attention to the front door</strong> and creates a warm glow that spills onto the ground, and up onto the house.</p>

<h2>Adjusting Colors for Mood</h2>

<p>To make the light feel warm, I adjusted the colors using curves. I took some of the green out and reduced the blue, giving the light a warmer tint. This helps the lamp light contrast with the cool blues of the night scene.</p>

<h2>Enhancing Depth with Low Mist</h2>

<p>I liked the idea of a low mist rolling in along the lake, as if the water is warmer than the air. This <strong>adds to the layering of the trees</strong> and creates a creepy atmosphere. The mist makes the scene more mysterious and helps the silhouette of the character stand out.</p>

<h2>Emphasizing the Character Silhouette</h2>

<p>It's important that the character's silhouette is as clear as possible. By adding mist and fog around the character, I ensured they stand out against the background. I considered whether the character should be holding a lamp to create another light source, but for clarity, I kept the character as a pure silhouette.</p>

<h2>Considering Rim Lights</h2>

<p>I experimented with adding <strong>mystery rim lights</strong> to the character. Rim lights are often used in film to add definition to subjects. By imagining skylight from behind, I added a subtle rim light to the character and the tops of some bushes. <strong>I used these cautiously to keep the scene believable</strong>, ensuring the light sources made sense within the context.</p>

<h2>Balancing Light and Contrast</h2>

<p>I made sure that the lights in the scene weren't too bright or unrealistic. The lamp on the house wouldn't cast a rim light all the way to the character, so I didn't include that. Instead, I focused on using mist and subtle lighting to make the character and elements stand out without losing the nighttime ambiance.</p>
