<p>Welcome back, everybody. Today, we're diving into the visual memory games level two assignment. I'll be drawing the mannequinized figure and doing three different visual memory games. Let's get started!</p>

<h2>Exercise 1: Look, Remember, Draw from Memory</h2>

<p>The first exercise is straightforward: observe the figure, memorize it, and draw from memory.</p>

<h3>Tips for Analyzing the Pose</h3>

<ul>

<li><strong>Focus on the Gesture and Major Rhythms</strong>: Notice the overall pose and any significant rhythms that define it. For example, observe how the shoulder aligns with the knee and foot.</li>

<li><strong>Take Mental Notes of Key Proportions and Alignments</strong>: Remember specific details like the knee being slightly higher than the belly button or the foot's position relative to the hips.</li>

<li><strong>Use Quick Measurements for a Head Start</strong>: Measure major distances, such as from the top of the head to the glutes and down to the foot. These measurements help maintain proportions.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Drawing Process</h3>

<ol>

<li><strong>Start with Proportions and Basic Angles</strong>: Begin by marking key points on the page to ensure the figure fits.</li>

<li><strong>Keep Lines Light for Adjustments</strong>: Draw lightly to make it easier to adjust proportions and angles.</li>

<li><strong>Draw the Mannequin Version</strong>: Focus on capturing the pose and proportions without worrying about detailed anatomy.</li>

</ol>

<h3>Reflection and Comparison</h3>

<p>After drawing, compare your work with the reference. Look for differences and areas to improve. Remember, the goal is to enhance your visual memory, so don't worry about perfection.</p>

<h2>Exercise 2: Draw from Reference, Then from a Different Angle</h2>

<p>The second exercise involves drawing the figure from reference and then drawing it again from a different angle from memory.</p>

<h3>Drawing from Reference</h3>

<ul>

<li><strong>Understand the Forms and Angles</strong>: Start with basic shapes and blobs to capture the pose. This helps in understanding the forms better.</li>

<li><strong>Use Blobs and Basic Shapes</strong>: Begin with loose shapes to position the figure correctly before refining it.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Drawing from a Different Angle</h3>

<ol>

<li><strong>Start with the Core of the Body</strong>: Begin with the torso and build outwards.</li>

<li><strong>Adjust the Pose to Fit the New Angle</strong>: Rotate the figure in your mind and adjust the limbs accordingly.</li>

<li><strong>Reflection on Challenges and Learning Points</strong>: This exercise is tough but rewarding. It forces you to understand the figure in three dimensions.</li>

</ol>

<h2>Exercise 3: Draw from Memory with Different Proportions</h2>

<p>The third exercise is to observe the figure, memorize it, and draw it from memory with different proportions.</p>

<h3>Observing and Memorizing the Figure</h3>

<ul>

<li><strong>Focus on the Core Pose and Key Angles</strong>: Pay attention to the main pose and the angles of the limbs.</li>

<li><strong>Take Mental Notes of the Limbs and Their Positions</strong>: Remember how the limbs are positioned and their relationships to each other.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Drawing with Different Proportions</h3>

<ol>

<li><strong>Change the Proportions While Maintaining the Essence of the Pose</strong>: Experiment with different proportions, like making the torso thicker or the legs shorter.</li>

<li><strong>Use Blobs and Basic Shapes</strong>: Start with loose shapes to explore the new proportions before refining the figure.</li>

<li><strong>Reflection on Challenges and Learning Points</strong>: This exercise is challenging but helps in understanding how proportions affect the overall pose.</li>

</ol>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p>These exercises are crucial for improving visual memory and drawing skills. Regular practice will help you get better at capturing poses and proportions from memory. Keep these exercises in your routine, just like gesture drawing. </p>

<p>Next time, we'll be doing critiques and moving on to the shading section of the course. See you then!</p>
