<p>In this lesson, I'm offering a slightly different approach to drawing the figure and gesture. This method is particularly beneficial when you have a bit of anatomy under your belt. It allows us to get to <strong>light and shadow</strong> more directly.</p>

<h2>Comparing Analytical and Observational Methods</h2>

<p>The first approach we looked at was about building an <strong>analytical relationship</strong> with the figure. It focused on <strong>line</strong>, a slow and methodical appreciation of rhythm, bones, and perspective. Every stage was meant to increase our understanding of the figure.</p>

<p>This new approach emphasizes the <strong>observational side</strong>. While the first approach dealt more with line and construction, this one focuses on <strong>shape</strong> and the establishment of <strong>simple parts</strong> in their design.</p>

<h2>Steps in the Observational Approach</h2>

<h3>Step 1: Identifying the Parts</h3>

<p>First, I break down the figure into its basic parts:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Head</strong></li>

<li><strong>Neck</strong></li>

<li><strong>Torso</strong> (which includes the ribcage, waist, and pelvis)</li>

<li><strong>Arms</strong></li>

<li><strong>Legs</strong></li>

</ul>

<p>I design each part as a <strong>shape</strong>. This requires a bit more knowledge of each part, but it allows us to summarize the figure effectively.</p>

<h3>Step 2: Understanding the Gesture of Each Part</h3>

<p>Next, I understand and include what the <strong>gesture</strong> of each part is. By gesture, I mean <strong>what the part could be doing</strong>. If we have a set shape, we consider:</p>

<ul>

<li>Is the shape <strong>tilting</strong>?</li>

<li>Is it <strong>turning</strong>?</li>

<li>Can we create some kind of <strong>shape modification</strong>?</li>

</ul>

<p>This approach is great for getting a more instant read of <strong>body type</strong>, which is important to the larger concept of gesture. Body type tells a story. I love Howard Schatz's photographic series on the '88 Olympic team because every athlete's body looks like their sport. The runners are narrow and sleek, while the weightlifters are heavy and solid. It's a great reference for creating characters.</p>

<h3>Step 3: Applying Simple Perspective</h3>

<p>Perspective in this approach is really simple, it's just <strong>wrapping lines</strong>. Instead of using boxes or complex perspectives, we add <strong>light and shadow</strong> to give the natural turn to a form. In nature, there is no line, line is a symbolic representation of a thing. <strong>Edge or value</strong> is how we understand perspective in everyday life.</p>

<h2>The Head</h2>

<p>In the previous approach, I presented the head as just a ball. While that's a good starting point, this method views the head as a <strong>cranium with a mandible</strong> (lower jaw). This gives a more specific shape or symbol.</p>

<h3>Designing the Head Shape</h3>

<p>I start by connecting with the <strong>part</strong>, the head, designing it as a shape that includes the cranium and the jaw. This shape forms the basis for our observations.</p>

<h3>Exploring Head Gestures</h3>

<p><strong>What can a head do?</strong> Heads can tilt, turn, and lean in different directions. Using the same shape, I explore:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Tilting</strong>: Angling the head in different directions.</li>

<li><strong>Turning</strong>: Moving the head towards one side or the other.</li>

<li><strong>Profile Views</strong>: Adjusting the shape to represent a profile view.</li>

</ul>

<p>By modifying the shape, we can create different <strong>characters</strong>. For example, softening the angles can give a more feminine appearance, while exaggerating certain features can suggest a grumpy soldier or a slender, elegant figure.</p>

<h3>Applying Perspective to the Head</h3>

<p>Perspective is applied using <strong>wrapping lines</strong>. I think of the <strong>brow</strong> and use the <strong>center line</strong> (symmetry line) of the face to indicate tilt and turn. Wrapping lines help us understand the form's three-dimensionality.</p>

<h2>The Neck</h2>

<p>The neck is the next part, and it's designed as a simple <strong>pillar</strong>. From the side view, it pushes forward, creating a nice diagonal.</p>

<h3>Designing the Neck Shape</h3>

<p>Understanding the <strong>part</strong> of the neck, I consider its connections to the head. The neck begins about a third of the way down from the head and connects to the torso.</p>

<h3>Exploring Neck Gestures</h3>

<p>Just like the head, the neck can:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Tilt</strong>: Lean side to side.</li>

<li><strong>Stretch and Pinch</strong>: Think of it like a beanbag that can compress and extend.</li>

</ul>

<p>By stretching and pinching the neck, we can express different gestures, such as the neck craning forward or tilting to one side.</p>

<h3>Modifying the Neck for Character</h3>

<p>We can modify the neck shape to push towards <strong>character</strong> or <strong>body type</strong>:</p>

<ul>

<li>For a more <strong>feminine</strong> neck, I might pinch it to make it thinner.</li>

<li>For a <strong>bruiser</strong> or strong character, I might make the neck big and thick.</li>

<li>For an <strong>elegant</strong> or slender figure, I might elongate the neck.</li>

</ul>

<p>This allows us to explore different shapes and storytelling opportunities.</p>

<h3>Applying Perspective to the Neck</h3>

<p>Perspective is again applied using <strong>wrapping lines</strong>. By wrapping lines around the neck, we can show its form and movement in space. Light begins to develop a slight appreciation of surface, and we associate the <strong>speed or timing of the form</strong> to an edge:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Slow-moving forms</strong> get <strong>soft edges</strong>.</li>

<li><strong>Quick-moving forms</strong> get <strong>firm edges</strong>.</li>

<li><strong>Abrupt-moving forms</strong> get a series of <strong>hard edges</strong>.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Connections Between Parts</h2>

<p>As I build each part, I ensure a <strong>solid connection</strong> before moving on to the next. Connections are made by <strong>overlapping</strong> and <strong>wrapping</strong> parts. For example, when adding the neck to the head, I overlap and wrap it to create a seamless transition.</p>

<h2>Adding Light and Shadow</h2>

<p>With this approach, we can use <strong>light and shadow</strong> to bring out the realistic feeling of perspective. We don't have to overwork the drawings at this stage. Adding light and shadow helps to give the form a natural turn and adds to the overall dimensionality of the figure.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p>This observational approach to drawing the figure focuses on designing each part as a shape and understanding its gesture and simple perspective. By breaking the figure down into parts, exploring their gestures, and applying wrapping lines for perspective, we can create figures that are not only structurally sound but also convey a strong sense of character and expression.</p>
