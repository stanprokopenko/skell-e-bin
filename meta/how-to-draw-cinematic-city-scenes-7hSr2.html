<p>I often start by making quick sketches or thumbnails in 4-point and 5-point perspective to capture big ideas before committing to a detailed drawing. By working small and rough, I can show concepts like an upshot of buildings or a wide, curved down shot without investing too much time. Later, I can refine those thumbnails or move on to a more polished piece.</p>

<h2>Four-Point vs. Five-Point Perspective</h2>

<p>Four-point perspective often appears in scenes where we see extreme angles, like looking up at tall buildings or framing an urban environment from below. In five-point perspective, we add an extra vanishing point, creating a subtle curve that can mimic the view from an airplane or a bird’s-eye look over a city. This curvature hints at the Earth’s roundness when we’re extremely high off the ground.</p>

<h2>Using a Spherical Grid</h2>

<p>One way to explore five-point perspective is to look up “spherical grids” online. These grids show curved lines that wrap around a sphere. By overlaying a spherical grid, I can find my five vanishing points and sketch buildings or environments that bend outward, simulating wide-angle shots. I sometimes use 3D software like Maya to generate a sphere with grid lines and then take a screenshot to use as a background.</p>

<h2>Setting Up a Down-Shot City</h2>

<p>When I draw a city shot in five-point perspective, I imagine the sphere divided by two main axes, like an equator and a prime meridian. That gives me four quadrants around a center point:</p>

<p>• <strong>Quadrants:</strong> I label them 1, 2, 3, and 4 for convenience.<br />

• <strong>Vanishing Points:</strong> There are five: one in the middle and four around the edges where the curved lines converge.</p>

<p>I start placing buildings in one quadrant, lining up their edges with the vanishing points. I draw the tops of the buildings first, then drop lines toward the center point for depth. The key is to keep each building’s edges curving appropriately so the perspective stays convincing.</p>

<h3>Streets and Scale</h3>

<p>I also sketch in streets and vary the size of buildings so everything doesn’t look uniform. Streets follow the same curved perspective lines, and objects shrink as they recede. By repeating this across the quadrants, I can build a complex panorama of a city that feels like it’s wrapping around the viewer.</p>

<h2>Flipping and Copying Buildings</h2>

<p>A time-saving trick is to copy one quadrant of buildings, then paste and flip it onto the opposite side of my drawing. I adjust the scale or distort some shapes so the repetition isn’t obvious. In production, we often rely on these shortcuts to quickly create background pans that save time while still looking believable.</p>

<h2>Applying 3D Tools</h2>

<p>I’ve also used 3D software to build a basic city block, then duplicated and modified pieces to create an entire environment. In drawing, the same idea applies: copy, paste, flip, or rotate buildings to fill out a scene fast. Changing heights or widths helps to disguise the repetition.</p>

<h2>Building a Curved Environment</h2>

<p>Five-point perspective can also push a scene into a more stylized, cartoony direction. By enlarging the spherical grid and letting the ground plane curve dramatically, I can design whimsical structures that appear to bend. I might place houses or other buildings along those curved lines, giving them a wonky, Roger Rabbit feel.</p>

<p>If I wanted an even faster conceptual thumbnail, I’d freehand the curved outlines, indicate a few buildings bending along those curves, and then refine or clean it up. This approach can work for lighthearted or fantasy environments where realism isn’t the main goal.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p>Whether I’m creating a realistic shot of a city or a playful cartoony world, four-point and five-point perspective are invaluable techniques. By using spherical grids, dividing space into quadrants, and understanding how buildings wrap around a curved ground plane, I can produce dynamic upshots, down shots and sweeping panoramas. This gives me the freedom to plan cinematic camera moves, or storyboard sequences that stand out. It’s all about combining classic perspective skills with a bit of creativity, and sometimes a few handy shortcuts, to bring immersive worlds to life.</p>
