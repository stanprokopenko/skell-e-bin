<h2>What's in Premium?</h2>

<p>In this lesson, I walk you through the creation of the variant cover for <strong>Fantastic Four #44</strong>. You'll learn how to emphasize <strong>teamwork and the family dynamic</strong> in your artwork. We'll explore composition techniques, such as integrating the <strong>Fantastic Four logo</strong> into the background, and discuss how to portray each character's unique abilities while <strong>avoiding stereotypes</strong>.</p>

<p>You'll see how to render different <strong>textures and materials</strong>—from <strong>Ben Grimm's rocky exterior</strong> to <strong>shiny metal</strong> and <strong>leather costumes</strong>—to add authenticity to your work. The lesson also covers the importance of <strong>capturing personalities</strong> and <strong>seeking feedback</strong> to enhance your art. By focusing on storytelling and character dynamics, you'll learn how to create compelling images that bring characters to life.</p>
