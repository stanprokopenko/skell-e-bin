<p>How do you get good at drawing something as complex as Jack Frost's Palace? You learn to think of the picture in several separate ways.</p>

<h2>Breaking Down Complexity</h2>

<p>Consider the image <strong>as a composition</strong>, focusing on how elements fit together. Think about <strong>color, line, and shape</strong> and how they interact. View it <strong>as a graphic story device</strong>, maybe turning one shot into three panels. Reflect on the <strong>subject matter</strong> itself: kids walking up a stairway led by a guy with strange skin.</p>

<p>But there's another side to this. The artist is thinking of the room as round, and we're inside it. He's considering the stairway's big structure and <strong>simplifying it down</strong> before adding details like the steps.</p>

<h2>Simplify Big Structures</h2>

<p>This is a basic lesson for artists who want to control complex environments: <strong>boil things down to the simplest form possible</strong>. Think in big cylinders or big simple shapes before adding complexity.</p>

<p>This setting is particularly challenging because we're inside the structure. We'll deal with that problem when we study the difference between <strong>exteriors and interiors</strong>.</p>

<h2>Recognize Three-Dimensional Structures</h2>

<p>Even if the artist didn't draw an explicit analysis, he was aware of the three-dimensional structures, <strong>macro, mid-level, and micro</strong>. Look at how the pillars in the back of the pavilion get thinner farther away and crowd together, the spaces between them get thinner.</p>

<p>And in case you want to know, this isn't technically accurate. Those far corner pillars would compress much more. But so what? <strong>It looks good!</strong></p>

<p>As you study, you'll notice things like that. As you work, you'll choose between <strong>technical truth</strong> and <strong>aesthetics</strong>.</p>

<h2>See Like a Cinematographer</h2>

<p>As you study lenses and proximity, you'll recognize that this is a <strong>wide-angle lens</strong>. You'll start to see like a cinematographer. You'll notice big three-dimensional structures.</p>

<p>If we were outside the structure, this big cylinder would look different. But the camera is inside. How do you draw that? <strong>Think in big cylinders</strong>.</p>

<h2>Work in Stages</h2>

<p>The artist worked in stages. He roughed the whole image in loosely with pencil, placing positions before detailing when working on something this complex.</p>

<p>Sometimes he didn't. He just went straight for it, <strong>fearless</strong>, <strong>spontaneous</strong>, <strong>planned</strong>, or <strong>meticulous</strong>. We'll deal with that in our next set of lessons.</p>

<h2>Focus on Big Simple Forms</h2>

<p>The big simple lesson here is to <strong>look for big simple things</strong>. This was to set sight on big simple forms.</p>
