<h2>How Contrast Directs the Eye</h2>

<p>Your eyes naturally <strong>seek out contrast</strong>. <strong>Lighting</strong> is crucial because it <strong>controls the contrast</strong> of a scene. In a shot from <em>Arcane</em>, your eye is drawn to the character with the <strong>brightest light</strong> next to the <strong>darkest dark</strong>. This high contrast automatically grabs your attention.</p>

<h3>Light on Dark and Dark on Light</h3>

<p>Using <strong>light on dark</strong> or <strong>dark on light</strong> makes subjects stand out. In <em>The Last of Us</em>, characters are silhouetted against contrasting backgrounds, making their shapes clear and <strong>easy to understand</strong>. In <em>Gladiator</em>, the boy is lit brightly against dark trees, focusing your attention on him. Similarly, in <em>Batman Begins</em>, the character's face is illuminated against a darker background, guiding your eye to the <strong>focal point</strong>.</p>

<h2>Understanding Exposure Levels</h2>

<h3>High Key Lighting</h3>

<p><strong>High key lighting</strong> is bright and exposed for the shadows. Scenes are filled with light, bouncing around the environment. Examples include <em>Oblivion</em>, <em>Star Wars</em>, and the bathroom fight in <em>Mission Impossible: Fallout</em>. This lighting style is <strong>light and airy</strong>, revealing details in the shadows.</p>

<h3>Low Key Lighting</h3>

<p><strong>Low key lighting</strong> is darker and exposed for the light sources, leaving shadows deep and less detailed. It's used to convey <strong>tension and mood</strong>. Examples are the moody scenes in <em>Skyfall</em> and <em>Blade Runner 2049</em>, where shadows dominate and create a sense of mystery.</p>

<h2>Using Color Contrast</h2>

<p><strong>Color contrast</strong> directs attention when an object differs in hue from its surroundings. In <em>Schindler's List</em>, the girl in the red coat stands out in the black-and-white film. In <em>The Blue Umbrella</em>, red and blue characters pop against a gray world. In <em>John Wick</em>, a character lit with orange light stands out among others lit in green. Using color contrast is a <strong>powerful tool</strong> to draw the viewer's eye.</p>

<h2>Choosing a Color Palette</h2>

<p>Simplified palettes are usually <strong>more appealing</strong> because they're easier on the eyes. In <em>Children of Men</em>, the scene uses gray, greens, and blues with a touch of orange light, creating a simple and clear image. <em>Looper</em> and <em>Close Encounters of the Third Kind</em> also use dominant colors to simplify the scene and enhance the mood.</p>

<h3>Light-Centric vs. Object-Centric Color</h3>

<p>You can choose between emphasizing the <strong>local color</strong> of objects or letting the <strong>light dominate</strong> the color. Children's shows often use object-centric colors with vibrant, varied hues for each character. Alternatively, films like <em>Klaus</em> use light-centric color, where neutral-colored objects are illuminated by colorful light, creating a cohesive and <strong>beautiful visual experience</strong>.</p>

<h2>Storytelling Through Color Shifts</h2>

<p>In <em>The Incredibles</em>, the filmmakers used a <strong>color script</strong> to support the story. The beginning is <strong>hyper-saturated</strong>, reflecting Mr. Incredible's vibrant memories. The colors become <strong>monochromatic and gray</strong> when he's unhappy, and then balance out as he finds harmony between work and family. Using color shifts helps convey the <strong>emotional journey</strong> and enhances the storytelling.</p>
