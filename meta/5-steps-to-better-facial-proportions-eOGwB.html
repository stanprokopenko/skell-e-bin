<h2>Homework Overview</h2>

<p>Your homework for this lesson focuses on <strong>incorporating facial proportions</strong> into your drawings. You'll be working on two main tasks:</p>

<ol>

<li>Adding proportions to your previous drawings</li>

<li>Creating new drawings that include all steps, including proportions</li>

</ol>

<p>This practice will help you develop your skills in accurately representing facial features and their relationships to each other.</p>

<h2>Adding Proportions to Previous Drawings</h2>

<p>Start by revisiting the drawings you've already created using the first four steps. Now, you'll add proportions on top of these existing drawings:</p>

<ul>

<li>Focus on the area from <strong>brow to chin</strong></li>

<li>Develop the <strong>halves and thirds</strong> of the face</li>

<li>Use these measurements to refine your existing drawings</li>

</ul>

<p>This exercise will help you see how proportions fit into your current drawing process and how they can improve the accuracy of your work.</p>

<h2>Creating New Drawings</h2>

<p>After practicing with your existing drawings, it's time to create new ones that incorporate all the steps you've learned:</p>

<ul>

<li>Create <strong>20 drawings</strong> in total</li>

<li>Spend <strong>5 minutes per drawing</strong></li>

<li>Work through <strong>steps one through five</strong></li>

</ul>

<h3>Drawing Techniques</h3>

<p>When creating your new drawings, follow these techniques:</p>

<ol>

<li>Start by establishing the <strong>brow to chin proportions</strong></li>

<li>Develop the <strong>halves and thirds</strong> of the face</li>

<li>Apply the previous steps (1-4) you've learned</li>

<li>Incorporate the new proportions (step 5) into your drawing process</li>

</ol>

<p>By combining all these steps, you'll create more accurate and well-proportioned facial drawings.</p>

<h2>Practice Guidelines</h2>

<p>To get the most out of this homework, follow these guidelines:</p>

<ul>

<li>Aim to spend about <strong>5 minutes per drawing</strong></li>

<li>Remember that the time limit is somewhat <strong>flexible</strong></li>

<li>Use the time limit to <strong>stay focused</strong> and avoid falling into bad habits</li>

<li>If necessary, you can extend the time slightly, but try to maintain some form of time constraint</li>

</ul>

<p>The 5-minute marker is designed to keep you on track and prevent you from overdoing or underdoing your drawings. It's okay to adjust the time slightly if needed, but try to maintain a consistent pace to develop good drawing habits.</p>

<p>By following these instructions and practicing regularly, you'll improve your ability to draw facial proportions accurately and efficiently. Remember, the key is consistent practice and applying the techniques you've learned in each drawing session.</p>
