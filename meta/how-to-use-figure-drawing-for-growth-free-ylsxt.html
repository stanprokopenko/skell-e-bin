<h2>What's in Premium?</h2>

<p>Discover efficient watercolor techniques for quick figure drawing. In this lesson, I share methods from my sketchbook, like using watercolors to capture rapid poses and laying down values swiftly. Learn how to enhance sketches with backgrounds, experiment with different mediums and colors, and emphasize volumes and shapes to bring depth to your work. We'll also explore ways to bridge the gap between loose sketches and finished illustrations, push your style, and tackle challenging posesâ€”all using practical tools and strategies.</p>
