<h2>Balancing Science and Art</h2>

<p>In this course, we'll dive into an <strong>intuitive approach</strong> to art. While we'll touch on scientific aspects, our focus is on a <strong>holistic balance</strong> between <strong>head and heart</strong>, <strong>science and creativity</strong>. It's not about choosing one over the other but finding harmony, which is the essence of composition.</p>

<h2>The Power of Visual Learning</h2>

<p>Did you know that <strong>90% of your brain's processing power</strong> is dedicated to <strong>visual data</strong>? As visual creatures, we naturally gravitate toward the visual arts. </p>

<p>You're:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>2x more likely to remember information if you take notes</strong></li>

<li><strong>6x more likely to remember if you draw during your notes</strong></li>

</ul>

<p>We never truly see the world until we <strong>learn to draw it</strong>. Drawing is a different skill that opens your eyes to the world's nuances.</p>

<h2>Learning to See Like an Artist</h2>

<p>Your biggest challenge isn't the material itself, it's learning to <strong>see the world through the eyes of an artist</strong>. Developing a holistic process to get what you see onto the page is a lifelong journey. It's about nurturing passion, while minimizing frustration.</p>

<h2>Reclaiming Creativity</h2>

<p>Globally, children's creativity <strong>plummets between ages four and six</strong>, right when they start public school. Traditional education often trains creativity out by emphasizing one right way and one right answer.</p>

<p>But as an artist, you know that while there's <strong>one sky</strong>, there are <strong>infinite ways to paint it</strong>. Balancing the <strong>science with the art</strong> allows for one right answer in some aspects (like shadows needing to be darker) while still embracing creativity in execution.</p>

<h2>Moving Beyond Technical Skills</h2>

<p>For now, set aside the technical aspects like perspective, anatomy, and the laws of light. Instead, dive deep into more <strong>creative realms</strong>. </p>

<h3>How We Learn Best</h3>

<p>To move information into your <strong>long-term memory</strong>, immerse yourself deeply and repeat the process. The best in the world:</p>

<ul>

<li>Immerse themselves daily</li>

<li>Repeat tasks to build mastery</li>

<li>Love the incremental improvements</li>

</ul>

<p>This repetition rewires your brain, making the process enjoyable rather than tedious.</p>

<h2>Techniques for Mastery: Filters and Iterations</h2>

<p>We'll employ two training techniques used by top performers: <strong>filters</strong> and <strong>iterations</strong>.</p>

<h3>Filters</h3>

<p>A <strong>filter</strong> is any <strong>craft, creative, conceptual, or emotional idea</strong> you have about creating art. Examples include:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Shadows are dark, lights are light</strong></li>

<li><strong>Things in the foreground get smaller</strong></li>

<li><strong>Line defines the outline , value renders the form</strong></li>

<li><strong>Organic vs. architectural shapes</strong></li>

<li><strong>Gesture and structure</strong></li>

<li><strong>Bone and muscle</strong></li>

</ul>

<p>Each filter represents an idea you can focus on. We'll start with simple filters and gradually incorporate more complex, personal concepts and emotions.</p>

<h3>Iterations</h3>

<p><strong>Iterations</strong> involve repeating a task multiple times to improve. For each filter:</p>

<ol>

<li><strong>Focus on one aspect</strong> (e.g., shape and line without tone)</li>

<li><strong>Draw it repeatedly</strong> (aim for 4â€“8 times)</li>

<li><strong>Refine with each iteration</strong> (adjust proportions, position, etc.)</li>

</ol>

<p>By focusing on specific filters and iterating, you'll:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Build muscle memory</strong></li>

<li><strong>Move corrections to a more sophisticated level</strong></li>

<li><strong>Feel motivated by immediate improvement</strong></li>

</ul>

<p>When you <strong>get better right away</strong>, you receive a burst of <strong>feel-good dopamine</strong>, encouraging you to return and continue practicing.</p>

<h2>The Role of Connection and Disconnection in Art</h2>

<p>Art often explores themes of <strong>connection and disconnection</strong>, a concept prevalent in spiritual traditions as well. </p>

<h3>Examples in Art</h3>

<ul>

<li><strong>Titian's "Assumption of the Virgin"</strong>:<ul>

<li>Earthly figures are <strong>disconnected</strong> from the heavenly realm.</li>

<li><strong>Mary</strong> serves as the connection between earth and heaven.</li>

<li>Use of <strong>triangles and circles</strong> symbolizes different realms.</li>

</ul>

</li>

<li><strong>Buddhist Art</strong>:<ul>

<li>The <strong>Buddha</strong> is <strong>big and elevated</strong>, we are <strong>small and low</strong>.</li>

<li>Represents the aspiration to connect with enlightenment.</li>

</ul>

</li>

</ul>

<p>These works use various <strong>filters</strong>, composition, shape, color, and value, to convey profound themes.</p>

<h3>Emotional Connection</h3>

<p>Consider how line quality, poses, lighting, and value range can express emotions like sorrow or joy. Every choice you make is a filter that contributes to the overall impact of your work.</p>

<h2>Simplify to Amplify</h2>

<p>When in doubt, <strong>simplify your approach</strong>. Focus on mastering the basics to become fluent, allowing you to explore deeper creative opportunities without technical obstacles.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p>Embrace this journey with passion. By balancing science and creativity, focusing on filters and iterations, and understanding the deeper themes of connection and disconnection, you'll not only improve your skills but also enrich your artistic expression.</p>

<p>Thank you for being passionate about art and striving to bring more <strong>beauty</strong> into your life and the world. Let's dive in and create something amazing together!</p>
