<h2>Project: Simple Extrusion on the Z-Axis</h2>

<p>Your task is to <strong>put your name in perspective</strong>. There are <strong>two ways</strong> to approach this project, and it's recommended to try both.</p>

<h3>Method 1: Precise Illustration</h3>

<p>Draw your name using <strong>one-point perspective</strong> to create a 3D effect. If using your name feels too self-focused, choose the name of someone you appreciate. Here's how:</p>

<ul>

<li>Use a <strong>ruler</strong> for accuracy.</li>

<li><strong>Draw each letter twice</strong>: once for the front plane and once for the back plane.</li>

<li><strong>Connect corresponding corners</strong> to create the illusion of depth.</li>

<li>Think of it like <strong>drawing two squares</strong> and connecting them to form a cube.</li>

<li>Determine the size of the back letters by <strong>drawing lines to the vanishing point</strong>.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Method 2: Rapid Iterations</h3>

<p>Practice by sketching your name or any shapes <strong>freehand</strong>, without a ruler.</p>

<ul>

<li>Complete <strong>20 quick sketches</strong> this week.</li>

<li>If you enjoy it, aim for <strong>100 sketches</strong> over the next two weeks.</li>

<li>Experiment with <strong>different vanishing point placements</strong> to see various effects.</li>

<li>This method helps you <strong>strengthen your idea-generating muscles</strong> and improves <strong>freehand line skills</strong>.</li>

<li>Use any shapes or letters, the goal is to understand <strong>perspective</strong>, not lettering.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Understanding One-Point Perspective</h2>

<h3>Limits of One-Point Perspective</h3>

<ul>

<li><strong>Placement of the vanishing point</strong> affects the drawing:<ul>

<li><strong>Too close</strong> to the center: the extrusion may not be visible.</li>

<li><strong>Too far</strong> to the side or above/below: creates distortion.</li>

</ul>

</li>

<li>When distortion occurs, it may be necessary to introduce a <strong>second vanishing point</strong>.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Tips for Working with Vanishing Points</h3>

<ul>

<li><strong>Work larger</strong> to manage lines converging at the vanishing point.</li>

<li><strong>Lighten your lines</strong> as they approach the vanishing point to reduce clutter.</li>

<li>Be aware that with long words or shapes, lines at the ends become <strong>almost horizontal</strong>, making them tricky to draw with a ruler.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Enhancing Your Skills</h2>

<ul>

<li>Completing finished illustrations helps you become <strong>comfortable with drawing instruments</strong>.</li>

<li><strong>Experiment</strong> with vanishing point positions:<ul>

<li>Above or below introduces <strong>vertical positioning</strong> (eye level).</li>

<li>Left or right introduces <strong>lateral positioning</strong>.</li>

</ul>

</li>

<li>Understanding these concepts prepares you for more complex perspectives, like <strong>five-point perspective</strong>.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Inspiration and Next Steps</h2>

<ul>

<li>Explore different <strong>alphabets and typefaces</strong> for ideas. Dover Publications offers excellent resources.</li>

<li>In our next lesson, we'll explore drawing objects with <strong>no perspective</strong>. Start thinking about simple to complex objects you'd like to draw.</li>

<li>For now, focus on <strong>extruding letters into space</strong> and enjoy the process of bringing flat shapes into the third dimension.</li>
