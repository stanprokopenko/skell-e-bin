<p>I like to start every hand study by sketching simple shapes that represent the palm, thumb, and fingers. That keeps things clear when I begin adding details. In a pronated hand (palm facing down), for example, I focus on the structure behind the thumb, making sure I see the fullness of the hand before worrying about each finger.</p>

<h2>Pronation vs. Supination</h2>

<p>I remember that <strong>pronation</strong> is when the palm faces down and <strong>supination</strong> is when the palm faces up. If you think “holding a bowl of soup,” that’s a supinated position. The difference in wrist rotation changes the angles I see in the palm and knuckles.</p>

<h2>Basic Hand Architecture</h2>

<p>I often imagine the wrist and back of the hand as a blocky shape, like a <strong>2x4</strong>. This helps me remember it’s wider at the palm side and narrower at the wrist. It also helps me track perspective when the hand angles in space.</p>

<h3>The “Bulging Box” Idea</h3>

<p>From many angles, I’ll draw the back of the hand as a <strong>bulging box</strong>, where the edges can curve gently instead of staying stiff and straight. That box can widen or narrow to fit my gesture and perspective.</p>

<h2>Adding the Thumb First</h2>

<p>Sometimes the thumb will be in front, and other times it’s on the side, but I usually sketch it in early. It overlaps the back of the hand and attaches at that padded <strong>thenar eminence</strong> (the fleshy base of the thumb). I often let the thumb overlap a construction line for the palm to remind myself which shape is on top.</p>

<h2>Placing the Fingers</h2>

<p>I add fingers once the thumb and palm feel solid. I look for overlaps and corners:

- <strong>Knuckles and Tendons:</strong> Before sketching each finger, I note a small corner or “crest” on the back of the hand where knuckles and tendons begin.<br />

- <strong>Length and Spacing:</strong> I’ll sometimes exaggerate finger length instead of making them too short. It’s an easier mistake to correct later, and it gives the hand a bit more grace.</p>

<h2>Handling Complex Angles</h2>

<p>If a view seems complicated, I break it into smaller parts and compare each new addition against everything else. For example:<br />

- Sketch the palm block.<br />

- Attach the thumb.<br />

- Map out each finger’s knuckle line.<br />

- Add curves for tendons and bulges.  </p>

<p>I adjust each area as I go, looking for overlaps that keep the drawing coherent.</p>

<h2>Profile or Near-Profile Positions</h2>

<p>In a pure profile, the hand might look almost like a <strong>teardrop</strong> or <strong>drumstick</strong> shape when I consider the forearm. The back of the hand may appear thinner because we see it from the side. I decide whether to group the ring and little fingers together or separate them, depending on how they overlap.</p>

<h2>Adjusting Proportions</h2>

<p>I often tweak proportions until the hand looks right in the context of the overall figure:

- If the thumb feels too thick, I trim it down.<br />

- If fingers appear too short, I lengthen them slightly.  </p>

<p>Nothing is locked in until I finalize the drawing. I keep it flexible so I can modify lengths and widths as needed.</p>

<p>Once I set the main forms, I can go back and refine details, like tiny tendons or the shape of each fingernail. The main lesson is to <strong>draw through the form</strong> and look past the immediate contours. By simplifying the hand into blocks, bulges, and teardrops, I can control the structure before layering in correct anatomy and gesture.</p>

<p>I hope this breakdown helps you clarify each step. Next time, I’m planning to do a lesson on feet, so I’ll see you there!</p>
