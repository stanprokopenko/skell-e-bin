<h2>Moon Knight #2 Retailer Variant Cover</h2>

<h3>Incorporating Egyptian Imagery</h3>

<p>For this cover, I wanted to highlight <strong>Moon Knight's Egyptian background</strong>. Instead of the standard gargoyle, I designed an <strong>Egyptian statue based on Khonshu</strong>, the Egyptian god linked to Moon Knight. I aimed to include as many <strong>Egyptian motifs</strong> as possible.</p>

<h3>Composition and Design Elements</h3>

<p>I focused on a strong <strong>pyramid composition</strong>, which felt logical given the Egyptian theme. Silhouetting Moon Knight against the moon created a striking <strong>contrast</strong>. I used <strong>warm tones toward the focal point</strong> and <strong>cool tones moving away</strong>, enhancing depth.</p>

<p>Repeating <strong>crescent moon shapes</strong> was key. They're present in the necklace, his crescent dart, chest symbol, the moon itself, and even the statue's shoulders. I shaped his cape to mimic both the <strong>moon</strong> and <strong>stylized Egyptian wings</strong>.</p>

<h3>Balancing Realism and Style</h3>

<p>My goal was to make the <strong>impossible look possible</strong> by blending realistic rendering with graphic design. I shot reference photos with a model and fabric to capture authentic folds, even though a real cape wouldn't behave that way.</p>

<p>Painting in <strong>oil on gessoed hardboard</strong>, I stained the surface with burnt umber. This allowed warm tones to show through the predominantly cool image. Adding <strong>vintage weathering</strong> gave it a worn look that matches my retro aesthetic.</p>

<h2>The Second Moon Knight Cover</h2>

<h3>From Black and White to Full Color</h3>

<p>This piece began as a cover for "Moon Knight Black, White, and Blood", intended to be <strong>black, white, and red</strong>. I designed it with a <strong>red neon sign</strong> as the sole color element. When asked to make it full color for the main series, I added more hues while retaining the original concept.</p>

<h3>Creating Atmospheric Lighting</h3>

<p>I love playing with <strong>warm and cool lighting</strong>, especially with Moon Knight's <strong>white costume</strong> that reflects its surroundings. The <strong>red neon glow</strong> contrasts with the cool night scene, adding depth.</p>

<p>I incorporated the <strong>"Crescent Club" neon sign</strong> featuring Khonshu's bird cowl logo. This not only ties back to Egyptian motifs but also makes the <strong>cityscape</strong> a character in itself.</p>

<h3>Fan Interaction and Success</h3>

<p>The editors chose <strong>"Crescent Club"</strong> from my suggestions, and it resonated with fans. Seeing people embrace something I created is incredibly rewarding. It's gratifying when art becomes part of their experience.</p>

<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>

<p>In both covers, I focused on:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Contrast</strong>: Light against dark and warm against cool to make images pop.</li>

<li><strong>Composition</strong>: Strong silhouettes using pyramid shapes and crescent motifs.</li>

<li><strong>Repetition of Themes</strong>: Incorporating Egyptian imagery throughout.</li>

<li><strong>Balancing Realism and Style</strong>: Rendering fantastical elements believably.</li>

<li><strong>Engaging Storytelling</strong>: Creating pieces that resonate and become memorable.</li>

</ul>

<p>I believe successful illustration finds the sweet spot between being <strong>iconic and unique</strong>. By blending familiar elements with fresh perspectives, we can create art that feels both comfortable and exciting.</p>
