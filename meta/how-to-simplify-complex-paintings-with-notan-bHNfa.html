<p>Welcome back, everyone! Today, I'm diving into <strong>Notan master thumbnails</strong>, specifically, <strong>two to three value master studies</strong> to explore values. I'll be doing several of these studies, focusing on <strong>value composition</strong>. I'm really excited for this because I love studying values and value compositions. It's like solving little puzzles, and it's all about <strong>interpretation</strong>, as you'll see. I'll do several variations of each one. There's something about values that just draws me in. With values you can get a really quick impression of what you're drawing.</p>

<p>I'm very excited to enter this part of the course. I think these little projects are going to be a bit more fun than some of the others.</p>

<h2>Simplifying a Complex Painting into Two Values</h2>

<h3>Interpreting the Lepage Painting</h3>

<p>The first painting I'm jumping into is this beautiful figure portrait by <strong>Jules Bastien-Lepage</strong>. At first glance, it seems complicated, there's a lot of detail everywhere. You've got the steps, the flowers she's holding, the guy in the background, and the folds in the drapery. There's just a bunch of stuff everywhere. But when I squint at it, it is actually a very simple composition. There's not too much happening. It's really well-organized, with very good <strong>control of values</strong>.</p>

<p>When I look at the steps and the wall on the bottom half and I squint, it all blends together into this lighter value. The whole top half of the composition is very dark, except for her face and neck, which really makes them <strong>pop forward</strong>. It's a bright value against a dark background. So, despite the apparent complexity, it's a very simple composition that can be interpreted in a few ways. I'll show you.</p>

<h3>First Two-Value Study</h3>

<p>I start with two values and do a few little thumbnails. When I squint at the painting, the first way I interpret it is <strong>dark at the top</strong> and <strong>light at the bottom</strong>. The face is a light shape on a dark background, and the bottom part of her dress and feet form a dark shape on a light background. It's really, really simple.</p>

<p>I draw something like a triangle, representing the dark area at the top. Inside it is her head. I'm not trying to make it the exact size, I'm simplifying to study the composition. Then, down below, I have the dark shape of her dress against the light of the background.</p>

<p>When I fill this in, you immediately see the basic composition. This is how I interpret the painting when I simplify it down to the most <strong>essential groups of value</strong>, the largest possible groups without losing everything. This is my simplification.</p>

<p>Now, this is overly simplified, you can't even tell that's a person in there. We're losing the context and making it so abstract that we lost the subject. But what we didn't lose is the <strong>value distribution</strong> and the <strong>composition</strong>, the balance of the values. This idea is still there, it's still present in the final painting. It's just that there's so much noise, it's not obvious initially that this is what's happening. But when I show you and you squint at it, it's like, "Oh yeah, that's it." That's what's going on here.</p>

<h3>Alternative Two-Value Interpretations</h3>

<p>But actually, there is another interpretation. If I push that threshold to include some of the medium values and assign them to the lights instead of the darks, for example, the background on the right, there's a separation between the wall and the drapery. The drapery over her torso is darker than the wall. So, you could interpret that as another separation. You could say that the entire right part of the background is part of the lights, and that creates a slightly different composition.</p>

<p>All I'm doing here is <strong>shifting that threshold</strong>, and both of these interpretations are valid.</p>

<p>I still have this really major shape, this <strong>V shape</strong>, it's kind of hard to avoid that. I'm simplifying all this as well. I know that she's going up, and her collar and all that, but I'm just thinking of big ideas for now.</p>

<p>In this interpretation, her hair is another dark shape. Again, the bottom part of her dress is a dark shape on light. When I fill this in, you can see that this creates a simpler story. The noise of the lights just doesn't matter. Even the noise of the flowers, they're really bright, but they're small enough that I could say, "For now, let's just avoid them." They're not important.</p>

<p>One more thing, when I squint, I see this horizontal area over here. This already is a really strong composition, I'd be happy with that. But if I'm just studying, I might include that shape over here as part of the darks. There you go, you've got two different interpretations just by sliding that threshold a little bit to include more lights. You can see that this creates a simpler design, very almost symmetrical and really elegant, whereas the previous interpretation becomes a lot more organic and puts a little more emphasis on the hair and this little hook shape. Both are true. In the end, when you add all the details, both of these effects combine, and they make the final impression.</p>

<p>All I'm saying is that when you're simplifying, there are multiple ways of interpreting, and if your way doesn't align with mine, it doesn't mean it's wrong, it just means you chose something different. But if you watch me do it and you like my interpretation better, then cool, you can learn from that.</p>

<h2>Expanding to Three Values</h2>

<h3>Deciding Where to Add the Third Value</h3>

<p>When I'm adding a <strong>third value</strong>, I need to decide where that darkest value is going to end. Is that darkest value going to include all of the background, and then this white space is going to be broken into middle and light? Or is it going to be this, and then this light space is going to have some middle and light? Or do I push that dark even more and maybe include only just the smallest dark shapes throughout? Sometimes that's another solution.</p>

<p>For this one, I feel like I'm going to take this and then break up the light space into a <strong>middle value</strong> and a <strong>light value</strong>. That, to me, seems like the most accurate way to do this.</p>

<h3>Creating a Three-Value Study</h3>

<p>Since this is a little bit bigger, I'm going to include a little more of the details but still keep it fairly simple. I still want to think in big shapes.</p>

<p>I start by <strong>blocking in the darkest darks</strong>. I'm being disciplined to ignore things because when you look at the drapery, there are some really fun shapes within these darks. But when you really look at it, everything within that drapery is really, really dark. He had the discipline to keep all of that information fairly compressed to those few dark values, which makes for a much stronger composition. Because if you put too many lights in there, suddenly it starts competing with these lights.</p>

<p>I'm simplifying the shapes, not drawing every tassel or loose fabric hanging off. I'm just squinting and trying to figure out the main shape. It takes a little bit of discipline to ignore things.</p>

<p>I consider whether to include the flowers. Even for this size of a thumbnail, it might be just a little too small, but we'll see. I decide to include them, and then I can always remove them if I feel like they're not adding to the study.</p>

<p>Now, there are some key details that are important to capture sometimes, like the features of the face. You could put a little shape for the lips and the eyes. I don't like to start drawing an actual face because then I'm concerned about capturing the likeness, and at this size, I really don't care. So you can just capture a few little shapes, and it's good enough.</p>

<p>Again, the bottom part of her dress, I'm being a bit more specific with what's going on, but it's still a very simple shape. I'm <strong>not drawing shoes</strong>, I'm just drawing the major plane changes. Maybe not even major, maybe secondary plane changes, because these are the major ones I captured earlier. Then, if I just go one level up...</p>

<p>I also notice that he has this dark shape here. In fact, I didn't notice it the first time, but there is a dark shape over here that I would consider to be just as dark as the fabric, and it kind of does this, and it's big enough for me to actually see it.</p>

<p>I think that's all of the darkest darks. Maybe I'll go and just darken them just a tad to make sure they separate from the middle value that I'm about to add. You don't have to go <strong>pure black</strong>, because as long as you've got <strong>three very clearly separated values</strong>, then it's good enough.</p>

<p>Now I'm going to get my HB pencil to make sure it's easier not to go too dark. What I'm seeing now is quite simple. The face is definitely <strong>lighter than the background</strong>, and then down here when I squint, the dress is a little bit lighter than the wall. There are areas in the dress that are a little bit darker than some areas of the wall, but overall, if I squint, the dress is just a tiny bit lighter than the wall.</p>

<p>So <strong>everything except the face and the dress is going to go to that medium value</strong>. Maybe some of the flowers stay white.</p>

<p>Notice how I'm adding a little bit of texture here. I'm not doing that on purpose, it's just that I'm going fairly quick. I'm not trying to create a perfectly flat value in here. I want it to be just flat enough to where it still feels like this is one contained shape, and the overlaps that I'm creating here are still not darker than the darkest darks. This whole area still is clearly one group, and it's not blending with this in any way.</p>

<p>You can have texture, you don't have to make it perfectly clean. Eventually, these are just going to become really practical things for you. You're going to end up doing these just to study for your own paintings, to prepare, because it doesn't make sense to figure out your composition on a big canvas. Usually, artists will think about it in little sketches. So, to be more practical with this sort of thing, you don't need to put that pressure on yourself to make it perfectly clean. Just clean enough that you can see the separations you're trying to identify, and see the major groups.</p>

<h2>Practical Applications and Examples</h2>

<h3>Lessons from William Charles Richards</h3>

<p>While flipping through a book of <strong>William Charles Richards</strong>, I noticed he has some really nice, simple, beautiful landscapes with very simple compositions. Lots of good stuff in there.</p>

<p>I really love his seascapes. Occasionally, you'll see he does these sketches that look like they were quite large, not thumbnails, but still loose sketches in preparation for something like a larger final painting.</p>

<p>He has these little pencil sketches, they almost look like thumbnails. These look much smaller, and are basically <strong>little value studies</strong>. They're very simple, creating value compositions. This one is even simpler, just little creations of value.</p>

<p>Look at these, so simple! It makes sense for him to figure this stuff out. Quick sketches before he gets to the final paintings. You look at most of the painting, and he's saying it's going to be this <strong>middle value</strong>, with a few <strong>darker areas</strong> and a few <strong>really light areas</strong>, and that's it. That's the composition.</p>

<p>I just wanted to show you how this isn't just for practicing getting good at values. This is something you can actually do before you do your <strong>large paintings</strong>.</p>

<h2>Exploring Further Interpretations</h2>

<p>I want to do a really quick fourth one because there are so many interpretations. When I first started looking at this, a lot of different versions went through my head, and there was another one that was actually really interesting. Eventually, I went against it because I thought, "It doesn't seem like that's what he was trying to do." But if that was what he was trying to do, I still think it's a really interesting version.</p>

<p>So I'm going to do a little one of this so I can go through it a little quicker.</p>

<p>It's going to be very similar to the previous one, but I'm going to push it to be more <strong>dark-heavy</strong>.</p>

<p>I draw the dark shape, and again, this whole shape in here is light. Then down here, I'm going to push it even darker.</p>

<p>In the previous interpretations, I had a <strong>floating dark shape</strong>, but when I look at his painting, I see that he's actually connecting it to some of these shadows on the wall and on the stairs. Those are the darkest parts of the wall at the bottom half of the painting. It's kind of like this, and then this is kind of like that.</p>

<p>Essentially, instead of a little floating shape, it's a shape that goes across the entire width of the painting, creating these <strong>steps</strong>. So you have <strong>light, dark, light, dark, light</strong>. This could be a two-value composition, or I could then go even further and say it's three values by knocking back this into a middle value and this into a middle value.</p>

<p>You can see I'm prioritizing speed a little bit over cleanliness on this one. I just want to show you what I'm thinking about.</p>

<p>But this is another version that I think you could totally argue is the version he's going for.</p>

<p>In all of these, you have this <strong>repeating step</strong>: you have light, dark, light, dark, light, dark, light, it's just repeating steps.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p>This is a beautiful painting and a great one to study for <strong>composition</strong> and <strong>major value breakups</strong>. You can see how this process is basically a combination of the previous studies put together. You're taking the darkest grouping and filling it in with the middle tone to now separate this piece and add more depth.</p>

<p>I wanted to show you how this isn't just for practicing getting good at values. This is something you can actually do before you do your large paintings. It's practical. It doesn't make sense to figure out your composition on a big canvas. Usually, artists will think about it in little sketches. So, to be more practical with this sort of thing, you don't need to put that pressure on yourself to make it perfectly clean. Just clean enough that you can see the separations you're trying to identify and see the major groups.</p>

<p>Beautiful, beautiful painting. I think this is a great one to study for composition and just major value breakups.</p>
