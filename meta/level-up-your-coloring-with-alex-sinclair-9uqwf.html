<p>I'm <strong>Alex Sinclair</strong>, a comic book colorist with years of experience in the industry. I've had the pleasure of working on various projects and collaborating with incredible artists and writers. In this article, I'll share insights into my current work, how I became a colorist, essential skills for aspiring colorists, and provide critiques and advice based on student submissions. Whether you're an aspiring colorist or an artist looking to enhance your storytelling, I hope these tips help you grow.</p>

<h2>Current Projects</h2>

<p>I'm currently working on <strong>Wolverine Revenge</strong> with <strong>Jonathan Hickman</strong>, <strong>Greg Capullo</strong>, and <strong>Tim Townsend</strong>. We're about to wrap that up. I'm also working on <strong>The New Iron Man</strong>, with <strong>Spencer Ackerman</strong> writing and <strong>Julius Orta</strong> on art. <strong>Iron Man</strong> is one of my favorite characters from when I was a reader, so getting to work on that book has been a tick-the-box moment for me.</p>

<p>Another project I'm involved in is <strong>Werewolf by Night</strong>, a <strong>red band comic book</strong> for mature readers because there's a lot of blood, hence the red band label. <strong>Jason Lowe</strong> is writing that, and we have a whole slew of artists working on it. <strong>Sergio Davila</strong> started the series off and is coming back on it now again.</p>

<p>I've also done some <strong>Star Wars</strong> books, which I'm a big fan of. I worked on <strong>Han Solo and Chewbacca</strong> with <strong>Mark Guggenheim</strong> writing and <strong>David</strong> doing the art. It was a fun series to work on with my favorite characters and my favorite spaceship.</p>

<h2>Workload and Collaboration with Marvel</h2>

<p>I usually work on about <strong>three books a month</strong>, and when you throw covers into the mix, it ends up being about <strong>three and a half to four books a month</strong>. It's a busy gig month to month. I had been exclusive with the competition for many years and decided it was time to break off and do my own thing. I reached out to <strong>Marvel</strong>, and they were incredibly receptive to my request to work with them. Everyone there, from <strong>Ricky Perdon</strong> who handled the talent to all the editors, was incredible and eager to send me work.</p>

<h2>Becoming a Colorist</h2>

<p>I became a colorist somewhat by accident. I was a <strong>failed penciler</strong>, a story that many inkers and colorists share. I showed my portfolio with pencils, inks, and colors, and while I always got critiqued on both pencils and inks, people really liked my <strong>color samples</strong>. It took me a couple of years to clue into the fact that everyone liked my color work. At the time, <strong>Image Comics</strong> had just started, and <strong>Jim Lee</strong> had his own studio and a talent search. I decided to send only my color samples, figuring it was what I was strongest at. Two weeks later, I got a call from Jim.</p>

<h2>Essential Skills for a Colorist</h2>

<p>You need to have a <strong>strong artistic base</strong> to be able to color. You don't have to be the best penciler out there, but you need to know how to draw because all those concepts translate. You use them differently as a penciler, inker, or colorist, but you use them all. So having that background in art is <strong>crucial</strong> to pull off any of these specialties.</p>

<h2>Advice for Aspiring Colorists</h2>

<h3>Collaboration is Key</h3>

<p>Remember that coloring is a <strong>collaboration</strong>. You're working after one or two artists, so you need to respect what was done before you. Don't be afraid to bring your own flair and style to what you're doing as well. You're part of a build, coming at the end to help put it all together to make sure that when you present, it's a solid package.</p>

<h3>Focus on Storytelling with Interiors</h3>

<p>I often see portfolios that have <strong>only covers</strong>, and one of the things I tell aspiring colorists is to <strong>color interiors</strong> because that's the job. A cover comes here and there, but the meat of the work you're going to do is <strong>20 pages of interior work</strong>. My advice is to download inks and color <strong>five-page sequences</strong>, color three or four of them. You want to show that you can <strong>tell the story</strong>, add mood, add drama, and help the art by popping the characters that need to pop and adding the special effects that enhance the action.</p>

<h3>Understanding Light, Mood, and Drama</h3>

<p>When taking over an inked page, you're reading the inks that are there, which will establish your <strong>light sources</strong>. You're also helping to add <strong>mood</strong> and <strong>drama</strong>, augmenting the storytelling. Reading the script is a big part of coloring interiors. I read a script for every book that I work on because it helps establish <strong>time of day</strong>, <strong>location</strong>, and sometimes the writer will drop <strong>color notes</strong>. Putting the script and art together, I decide what <strong>palette</strong> to use and what colors will help the characters pop.</p>

<h2>Critiques and Common Challenges</h2>

<h3>Consistency in Rendering and Lighting</h3>

<p><strong>Consistency</strong> plays a big part in what you're doing. If you're rendering one character fully, then you need to do that to every character. Be consistent with your <strong>highlights</strong> and <strong>shadows</strong> across the entire piece. Make sure you're not contradicting the established light sources.</p>

<h3>Understanding Value and Depth</h3>

<p>Pay attention to the <strong>value scale</strong> or the value difference from background to foreground. Values that are too similar can <strong>flatten the image</strong>. Use value and saturation to create <strong>depth</strong>, with the <strong>darkest values</strong> coming forward and lighter values receding. Establishing <strong>foreground</strong>, <strong>middle ground</strong>, and <strong>background</strong> helps guide the viewer's eye and enhances storytelling.</p>

<h3>Importance of Anatomy and Form</h3>

<p>You need to have a good grasp of <strong>anatomy</strong> and how to render forms. Think of objects as <strong>simple shapes</strong> first to establish highlights and shadows. Then, model the forms by adding layers of rendering to give objects <strong>mass</strong> and <strong>depth</strong>. Use references and anatomy books to improve your understanding.</p>

<h3>Utilizing Color Theory</h3>

<p>Understanding <strong>color theory</strong> is crucial. Use <strong>warm colors</strong> to bring elements forward and <strong>cool colors</strong> to push elements back. <strong>Complementary colors</strong> can help pop characters from the background. Be mindful of how colors interact and affect the overall composition.</p>

<h3>Strategic Use of Saturation and Texture</h3>

<p><strong>Saturation</strong> and <strong>texture</strong> can help separate planes and add realism. Use saturation to draw attention to key elements and desaturate areas that shouldn't compete for attention. Adding texture to backgrounds or certain elements can create depth and interest without overpowering the main focus.</p>

<h2>Workflow and Digital Tools</h2>

<h3>Efficiency and Shortcuts</h3>

<p>Your workspace is a big part of <strong>efficiency</strong> and <strong>speed</strong>. Learn the <strong>shortcuts</strong> of the software you use. Instead of using the tool palette, using <strong>hotkeys</strong> saves the movement it takes to select tools manually. Eliminating small movements can significantly speed up your process.</p>

<h3>Utilizing Digital Tools</h3>

<p>I work a lot with <strong>Wacom</strong> products and use tools like the <strong>ExpressKey Remote</strong>, programming keystrokes into it. They also have <strong>on-screen menus</strong> that I use with the pen. This setup feeds the efficiency of my process. My keyboard is off to the side, and my hands are on the tablet and remote, allowing me to work continuously.</p>

<h3>Keeping Up with Technology</h3>

<p>Technology is always improving and changing. Programs like <strong>Photoshop</strong>, <strong>Clip Studio</strong>, and <strong>Procreate</strong> offer different tools and features. The <strong>iPad</strong> and apps like Procreate have changed things, allowing for more flexibility. I use both Procreate and Photoshop in my work. Keeping up with new tools and software is part of the job and helps you stay efficient and competitive.</p>

<p>Thank you to everyone who submitted their work. It was a lot of fun to look through your pieces. I hope the critiques help you grow. As you continue to work on coloring, remember that interiors are a big part of the coloring process. It's okay to start with one page, but you also want to take a <strong>five-page scene</strong> and color that because you want to show that you can <strong>tell the story</strong>.</p>

<p>If you're going to be a colorist, <strong>color someone else's work</strong>. That's the job. You're not going to pencil, ink, and color your own book, at least not initially. You need to learn to adapt to someone else's work. Download pages drawn by different artists, color them, and adapt to different styles. When building your portfolio, include a lot of <strong>interior pages</strong> to show your storytelling abilities.</p>

<p>Always be willing to <strong>learn</strong> and keep improving. Understand the importance of <strong>collaboration</strong>, <strong>consistency</strong>, and <strong>efficiency</strong> in your workflow. Keep up with technology and make use of the tools available to you. Most importantly, <strong>enjoy the process</strong> and bring your own flair to your work.</p>
