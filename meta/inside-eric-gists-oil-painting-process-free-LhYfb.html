<h2>What's in Premium?</h2>

<p>In the full lesson, I walk you through my oil painting process from preparation to final touches. You'll learn about the materials I use, including my preferred paints, brushes, and surfaces. I'll show you how I prepare hardboard panels with gesso and transfer drawings using carbon paper. We cover techniques for starting a painting, mixing colors, and layering from thin washes to thicker applications. I'll discuss focusing on shape, value, edge, and temperature, and share tips for adding final details to bring your painting to completion. This lesson also includes advice on developing your skills through consistent practice.</p>
