<h2>Moon Knight Issue #2 Cover</h2>

<p>In this segment, I'll walk you through my approach to creating the cover for the new Moon Knight comic series, specifically issue #2. This was a retailer variant, meaning a store contacted Marvel and requested me to do a cover specifically for them.</p>

<h3>Embracing the Egyptian Background</h3>

<p>I've always been fascinated by Moon Knight's Egyptian heritage, which wasn't extensively explored in earlier comics. For this cover, I aimed to incorporate as many Egyptian images and motifs as possible. I wanted to move away from the standard gargoyle imagery that's commonly associated with Moon Knight perched on rooftops.</p>

<h3>Design Elements and Composition</h3>

<p>I designed a gargoyle based on Egyptian statuary, and it was particularly inspired by the Egyptian god Khonshu. The composition follows a strong <strong>pyramid shape</strong>, which symbolizes the Egyptian theme. I included the moon prominently, silhouetting Moon Knight against it to create a <strong>warm against cool contrast</strong>, warm hues towards the focal point and cooler tones away from it.</p>

<p>I intentionally repeated <strong>crescent moon shapes</strong> throughout the piece:</p>

<ul>

<li>Khonshu's necklace</li>

<li>Moon Knight holding his crescent dart</li>

<li>The crescent on his chest</li>

<li>The moon in the background</li>

<li>Crescent shapes in the shoulders of the statue</li>

</ul>

<p>I also shaped his cape to mimic both the curve of the moon and the stylized wings found in Egyptian imagery. This design choice added depth, even though some details get lost due to the trade dress on the cover. Fortunately, a virgin variant without the text allows the full artwork to be appreciated.</p>

<h3>Lighting and Contrast</h3>

<p>To draw the viewer's eye, I utilized a concentric ring approach:</p>

<ul>

<li>A warm, well-lit focal point at the center</li>

<li>Middle tones surrounding the center</li>

<li>Darker, cooler tones as we move outward</li>

</ul>

<p>This creates a <strong>bullseye effect</strong> that emphasizes the main subject. The only warm area is the focal point, enhancing its impact against the cooler background.</p>

<h3>Rendering and Realism</h3>

<p>Once the design was solidified, I focused on making the drawing work:</p>

<ul>

<li>Found reference images of old, worn statues and gargoyles</li>

<li>Used a model, Yoni Baker, for dynamic poses</li>

<li>Shot reference photos of fabric in my garage to capture realistic folds</li>

</ul>

<p>I aimed to blend realistic rendering with graphic design. For instance, the cape's shape is stylized but rendered realistically to make the impossible look possible.</p>

<h3>Final Touches</h3>

<p>Knowing that we'd use the classic 70s trade dress, I added fake weathering to the cover to give it a <strong>worn vintage look</strong>. This retro aesthetic complements my style and resonates with the pulp cover feel I often strive for.</p>

<h3>Reflections on the Piece</h3>

<p>I believe this piece is most successful in its atmospheric qualities. The overall cool light paired with a warm spotlight creates a compelling visual. Transitioning between warm and cool without creating muddy tones was a challenge, but I managed to achieve smooth transitions that enhance the form.</p>

<p>I'm particularly pleased with:</p>

<ul>

<li>The interplay of light and shadow</li>

<li>The successful integration of Egyptian motifs</li>

<li>The balance between graphic elements and realistic rendering</li>

</ul>

<h2>Moon Knight "Crescent Club" Cover</h2>

<p>Next up is another Moon Knight piece, affectionately known as the "Crescent Club" cover. This project was exciting because it underwent several iterations and ended up being used for the main Moon Knight series.</p>

<h3>Initial Concept and Changes</h3>

<p>Originally, this cover was intended for the anthology series <strong>Moon Knight: Black, White, and Blood</strong>, which is printed only in black, white, and red. My initial concept featured:</p>

<ul>

<li>A predominantly black and white image</li>

<li>The neon sign and its glow on Moon Knight rendered in red</li>

</ul>

<p>However, Marvel later asked if I would adapt it for the main series, which meant moving to full color. I added more color while keeping the spirit of the original concept. The neon sign and its red lighting remained focal points.</p>

<h3>Design and Composition</h3>

<p>I wanted the city, or at least Moon Knight's area of it, to become a character in the piece. The <strong>neon sign</strong> was central to this idea. We had extensive discussions about what the sign would say, and ultimately settled on <strong>"Crescent Club"</strong>. This choice ties back to the crescent moon motifs associated with Moon Knight.</p>

<p>Consistent elements include:</p>

<ul>

<li>The crescent shapes in his cape and weapons</li>

<li>The moon in the background</li>

<li>The Khonshu symbol atop the sign, echoing previous designs</li>

</ul>

<h3>Lighting and Textures</h3>

<p>Playing with textures and lighting was a joy:</p>

<ul>

<li>Used cool atmospheric lighting for the overall scene</li>

<li>Employed warm red lighting from the neon sign on Moon Knight</li>

<li>Created a satiny texture for the inside of the cape</li>

<li>Rendered his costume with a different material feel, like lycra</li>

<li>Included silver bracers for metallic contrast</li>

</ul>

<h3>Contrast and Silhouettes</h3>

<p>Strong silhouettes are crucial:</p>

<ul>

<li>Light against dark and dark against light for visual impact</li>

<li>The cityscape is darker against a lighter sky at the bottom</li>

<li>Transitioned to a light moon against a dark sky at the top</li>

</ul>

<p>This contrast enhances the three-dimensionality of the piece and ensures it <strong>pops at any size</strong>, from a small thumbnail to a full-sized poster.</p>

<h3>Perspective and Design Elements</h3>

<p>I utilized an <strong>upshot three-point perspective</strong> to add drama. Balancing graphic design with realistic rendering was key. The combination of Moon Knight's dynamic pose with the striking neon sign created a compelling image.</p>

<p>The <strong>Crescent Club</strong> name became a hit among fans, sparking interest on social media. It's rewarding when an element you included resonates strongly with the audience, becoming a memorable part of their experience with the character.</p>

<h3>Reflections on the Piece</h3>

<p>I'm particularly proud of:</p>

<ul>

<li>The successful integration of perspective and composition</li>

<li>The atmospheric lighting and how it defines form</li>

<li>The way the piece balances familiarity with uniqueness</li>

</ul>

<p>This piece, like the previous one, showcases the importance of designing with <strong>contrast</strong>, both in value and color. Rendering enhances the piece, but it's the underlying design that truly makes it stand out.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p>Working on these Moon Knight covers allowed me to explore themes and motifs I'm passionate about. By repeating elements like crescent shapes and Egyptian symbolism, I created cohesive images that resonate with fans.</p>

<p>These pieces highlight my love for:</p>

<ul>

<li>Combining graphic elements with realistic rendering</li>

<li>Utilizing atmospheric lighting to enhance mood</li>

<li>Crafting compositions that are both iconic and fresh</li>

</ul>

<p>It's been gratifying to see how these covers have connected with readers, and I hope they continue to enjoy my work as much as I enjoy creating it.</p>
