<h2>What's in Premium?</h2>

<p>Learn to draw dynamic figures by focusing on <strong>movement</strong> and <strong>asymmetry</strong>. This lesson explores how to use offset curves and apexes to create <strong>rhythm</strong> in your drawings, making them more engaging. You'll discover how to represent body parts with simple lines—using <strong>C-curves</strong>, <strong>S-curves</strong>, and <strong>wrapping lines</strong>—to convey form and perspective.</p>

<p>We'll walk through steps for <strong>gesture drawing</strong>, starting with the head and spine, adding the pelvis, limbs, and feet, all while emphasizing <strong>rhythm</strong> and <strong>movement</strong>. You'll also learn to adjust and personalize your approach, practicing with different views to enhance your figure drawing skills.</p>
