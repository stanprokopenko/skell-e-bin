<p>Switching from using a grid to freehand drawing can be a significant change in your artistic process. Previously, you might have relied on a printed, blown-out photo to focus on basic shapes. Now, you're moving towards using a color photo for freehand drawing, which requires a different approach and mindset.</p>

<p><strong>Tools and Setup</strong></p>

<p>When transitioning to freehand drawing, you'll be working on a 16 by 12 inch board, which matches the size of your photo. Instead of printing the photo, you can view it on a monitor. This setup allows you to take advantage of digital tools like cameras and monitors. However, if you don't have a monitor, consider printing your photo on large photo paper.</p>

<p><strong>Techniques for Focusing on Shapes</strong></p>

<p>To focus on shapes without losing the overall image, squinting can be a helpful technique. This method allows you to simplify the photo into light and dark shapes, making it easier to identify the basic forms. Working from a monitor is often preferred, as it provides flexibility and access to digital tools.</p>

<p><strong>Drawing Materials</strong></p>

<p>For your drawing materials, use a kneaded eraser and charcoal. Charcoal is particularly favored for its erasability, allowing you to make adjustments as needed.</p>

<p><strong>Challenges Without a Grid</strong></p>

<p>Without a grid, determining starting points and proportions can be challenging. Beginners might find it difficult to decide on placement and size. This is where your visual judgment becomes crucial.</p>

<p><strong>Visual Judgment and Landmarks</strong></p>

<p>Focus on negative space and eyeball proportions in a loose manner. Look for landmarks and shapes to guide your drawing. Landmarks, such as the chin and forehead, can help you maintain accurate proportions. Remember, erasing and adjusting as you go is an essential part of the process.</p>

<p><strong>Simplifying the Image</strong></p>

<p>Squinting helps you simplify the photo into light and dark shapes. This technique encourages you to develop your skills without relying on software for simplification.</p>

<p><strong>Measuring and Placement</strong></p>

<p>Measure shapes for placement without a grid by using any helpful reference points. Landmarks like highlights in the eyes can assist with accurate placement. Once you have a general placement, blend the darks together to create a cohesive image.</p>

<p><strong>Correcting Mistakes</strong></p>

<p>Correcting mistakes early is crucial. Continuous re-measuring ensures accuracy in your drawing. Avoid starting with a wash, as it's not suitable for beginners. This approach is compared to a magician's trick, which can complicate the painting process if not handled correctly.</p>

<p><strong>Capturing Likeness</strong></p>

<p>To capture the subject's likeness, focus on specific features like the nose. The relationship between eye width and nose length is key to capturing a person's essence. By paying attention to these details, you can create a more accurate and lifelike representation.</p>
