<h2>Start Simple and Build Gradually</h2>

<p>You want to begin with the simplest version of your drawing and then add more detail over time. Start with <strong>large, basic shapes</strong> and simple forms. As you gain confidence, include <strong>smaller forms, more character, and refined techniques</strong>.</p>

<h2>Draw Lighter and Use Multiple Lines</h2>

<p>Make your early lines <strong>light</strong> and keep your touch gentle, whether you use a lighter pencil grade (like 2H) or control your pressure with charcoal or digital tools. Then, practice a <strong>“lots of lines” strategy</strong>:</p>

<p>• Draw each contour several times (like an athlete repeating a swing).<br />

• Cluster lines together to refine shape and build muscle memory.<br />

• Stay flexible so you can adjust lines without worrying about erasing.  </p>

<p>When you repeatedly draw the same line, you get a better feel for proportion and gesture.</p>

<h2>Chunking Down and Immersion</h2>

<p>Take a cue from sports or music: <strong>focus on one skill at a time</strong> before moving on. If you need better contours, spend a few moments practicing only those contours. Immerse yourself in one detail, then another. Over time, you build strong coordination and visual accuracy.</p>

<h2>Two-Dimensional Sides vs Three-Dimensional Ends</h2>

<p>Begin with <strong>flat, two-dimensional sides</strong> of a shape. For example, when drawing a tube, outline its sides lightly. Then, <strong>add the three-dimensional ends</strong>. These ends create the feeling of depth and show how the object tilts in space.</p>

<p>• The sides establish the general width and height (the 2D shape).<br />

• The ends show you the tilt and thickness (making it 3D).  </p>

<h2>Top vs Bottom View</h2>

<p>When looking <strong>on top</strong> of a form, details at the center appear <strong>lower</strong>, and details at the sides appear <strong>higher</strong>. When looking <strong>underneath</strong>, the center details go <strong>higher</strong>, and the sides go <strong>lower</strong>. Think of wrapping stripes or a belt around a cylinder, those stripes shift higher or lower depending on your viewpoint.</p>

<h2>Tubes as 3D Gesture Lines</h2>

<p>A <strong>tube</strong> is essentially a <strong>three-dimensional gesture line</strong>. If you sketch a quick curve for an arm or leg, give that curve some thickness by turning it into a tube. This approach keeps your whimsy and flow intact while preserving volume.</p>

<h2>The Law of Ellipses</h2>

<p>An ellipse must sit at a <strong>right angle</strong> to the tube’s long axis. If your cylinder leans at an angle, make sure each end forms an ellipse that is perpendicular to that central axis. Also, <strong>blend your ellipse into the sides</strong> so it looks round. Avoid flattening the form by creating a “pinched” shape.</p>

<h2>Common Pinching Mistake</h2>

<p>Don’t let the ellipse’s arc cut awkwardly into the edges of your tube. If you form sharp corners, the shape flattens. Instead, smoothly connect the ellipse to the tube’s side. This keeps your cylinder believable and retains depth.</p>

<h2>Practice Assignment</h2>

<ol>

<li>Draw <strong>simple tubes</strong> from different viewpoints. Work lightly and use multiple lines.  </li>

<li>Emphasize <strong>two-dimensional sides</strong>, then add <strong>three-dimensional ends</strong>.  </li>

<li>Apply the <strong>law of ellipses</strong> to keep your cylinders looking solid and consistent.  </li>

</ol>

<p>Continue refining these exercises to store the skills in long-term memory. When you place these forms into complete figures, your drawings will feel more confident and dynamic.</p>
