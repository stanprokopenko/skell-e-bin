<h2>Visual Communication in Composition</h2>

<p>When I think about composition, especially how <strong>light and color</strong> play into it, I realize it's easy to get lost in countless rules, zigzag compositions, triangle compositions, and so on. These rules can be overwhelming and often prevent us from grasping what composition is truly about, <strong>visual communication</strong>. What am I trying to say visually with my image? How do I compose the elements within the frame, and use light and color to convey my message?</p>

<h2>Overcoming Accidental Success</h2>

<p>I've noticed that many artists experience the <strong>curse of accidental success</strong>. Occasionally, a piece turns out amazing without us really knowing why. We might think that as long as we keep creating, we'll occasionally strike gold. But relying on luck isn't the answer. Art isn't about magic or just natural talent. Artists who consistently produce great work have taken the time to learn <strong>what makes a good image</strong>. They've transformed knowledge into skill through focus, persistence, and effort.</p>

<h2>Types of Composition</h2>

<p>To create effective compositions, I focus on understanding two main types:</p>

<h3>Geometric Composition</h3>

<p>This involves the <strong>placement of objects within the frame</strong>, where are the mountains, trees, or figures on screen?</p>

<h4>Lensing</h4>

<p>I find it crucial to understand cameras and how <strong>lenses</strong> work. Different lenses change the perspective, affecting how the subject and background appear. For example, a wide-angle lens can distort features up close, while a telephoto lens compresses space, bringing background elements closer.</p>

<h4>Framing</h4>

<p>Using <strong>frames within frames</strong> helps me direct the viewer's eye and keep it within the image. Elements like doorways, windows, or overhanging branches can provide a natural frame around the focal point.</p>

<h4>Repetition</h4>

<p>By incorporating <strong>repetition</strong>, I can communicate <strong>depth and scale</strong>. Showing objects of known size diminishing into the distance conveys vastness or magnitude.</p>

<h4>Leading Lines</h4>

<p>I use <strong>leading lines</strong> to guide the viewer's eye to the focal point of the image. Roads, pathways, or lines in architecture and nature can draw attention to where I want the viewer to look.</p>

<h4>Blocks (Big Shapes)</h4>

<p>Utilizing <strong>big shapes</strong> or blocks of value and color helps to simplify the composition and make it easier to understand. Large areas of color or tone can emphasize the focal point and enhance visual impact.</p>

<h4>Rule of Thirds</h4>

<p>The <strong>rule of thirds</strong> suggests dividing the image into thirds, both horizontally and vertically, and placing important elements along these lines or at their intersections. This creates a more balanced and visually appealing composition.</p>

<h3>Lighting Composition</h3>

<p><strong>Lighting</strong> adds another layer to composition by influencing what's lit and what's in shadow. It affects contrast, depth, and mood. For example, I've seen how the same scene can look dramatically different under various lighting conditions, changing how we perceive and understand the image.</p>

<p>By understanding these principles of composition, both geometric and lighting, we can move beyond accidental success. Instead of relying on luck, we apply knowledge and skill to create images that effectively communicate our intended message. For me, it's all about visual communication, using composition, light, and color to tell a story through art.</p>
