<h2>What's in Premium?</h2>

<p>In this lesson, we review common challenges in creating value scales and offer practical tips to improve your work. We address difficulties in distinguishing adjacent mid-tones and explain why it's important to use the full value range in your drawings. You'll learn how to establish your darkest dark and middle value to anchor your scale. We also discuss how paper texture and pencil choice affect shading, and the impact of lighting when drawing and photographing your artwork. This lesson aims to help you better perceive and render subtle differences in value.</p>
