<p>In this lesson, you'll continue learning about <strong>light and form</strong>. Previously, you focused on shadows. To understand the last type of shadow, you'll need to explore <strong>different types of light sources</strong>.</p>

<p>So far, you've discussed shadows in the context of a light source like the sun, a single light source that travels in one direction and creates shadows evenly and predictably. But this is not the only way to light your paintings. Choosing the right type of light source can have a huge impact on the mood of your piece.</p>

<h2>The Nature of Light</h2>

<p>The good news is that there's no such thing as different "types" of light. For painting purposes, <strong>all light behaves exactly the same way all the time</strong>. However, the effect light has in your paintings can change depending on the properties of the light source and the environment being lit. You refer to different types of light sources to make conversation easier.</p>

<h3>Light Bulb Example</h3>

<p>Imagine you have a light bulb. Light can be thought of as beams traveling outward from the light source, so your light bulb emits light in all directions. Objects around the light bulb are lit according to which plane is facing the light bulb.</p>

<p>There's a concept called <strong>light falloff</strong>, where objects further away from the light bulb become exponentially darker. If you double the distance of cubes from the light bulb, they'd become dramatically darker.</p>

<h3>The Sun as a Light Source</h3>

<p>In the previous lesson, you used the sun as your light source. The sun behaves exactly like a light bulb on a cosmic scale, it's a spherical light source emitting light in all directions. However, the sun is unfathomably bigger, brighter, and further away than a light bulb. Because of its size and distance, by the time you're looking at objects on Earth, the light is, for all intents and purposes, traveling in a single direction.</p>

<p>What about light falloff with the sun? It does happen, but not on a perceptible level here on Earth. Light falloff depends on the brightness of the light source and the relative distance of the object to that light source. The sun is about 93 million miles away, so to get even 1% farther away, you'd have to travel about 930,000 miles.</p>

<h3>Examples of Different Light Sources</h3>

<p>Understanding the properties of light helps you imagine how different light sources might work in your paintings. For example:</p>

<ul>

<li>

<p>A <strong>flashlight</strong> is a very bright light source, so it can travel quite a distance before being affected by falloff. The light is blocked on all sides except the front-facing glass, so the beam expands outward as it travels.</p>

</li>

<li>

<p>A <strong>candle</strong> is a weaker light source than a flashlight, so it will fall off more quickly. However, it emits light in all directions and will light all nearby objects.</p>

</li>

</ul>

<h2>Light Falloff</h2>

<h3>Relative Distance and Brightness</h3>

<p><strong>Light falloff</strong> is dependent on the <strong>relative distance</strong> of the object to the light source. If you have cubes 3 feet away from a light bulb with a value around 6, and then double the distance to 6 feet, the planes drop to a value of 2. They become dramatically darker because they're 100% farther away.</p>

<h3>Exponential Nature of Light Falloff</h3>

<p>Light falloff is <strong>exponential</strong>. If the cubes 3 feet away have a light value of 6, you might expect doubling the distance would cut the light value in half, down to 3. But they go even further, all the way down to 2. Just like with form shadows, light falloff happens more slowly at first and then more quickly with increasing distance.</p>

<h2>Hard Light vs. Soft Light</h2>

<h3>Scattering and Soft Light</h3>

<p>Let's return to the sun as your light source. On a cloudy day, there's still plenty of light, but it doesn't seem to come from any one particular direction, and the shadows become very soft and subtle. This is <strong>soft light</strong>, and it's the result of <strong>scattering</strong>.</p>

<p>When light hits a <strong>translucent</strong> surface, like clouds, some of it bounces off, and some passes through, bouncing repeatedly and changing direction until it re-emerges. By the time the sunlight reaches you on the ground, it's no longer coming from the direct angle of the sun, but rather from lots of different directions all at once.</p>

<h3>Comparing Hard and Soft Light</h3>

<p>In <strong>hard light</strong> with a single light source, you get clear light sides and shadow sides, and the cast shadows have hard edges. With <strong>soft light</strong>, the form rolls almost imperceptibly towards shadows and may not have a true shadow side at all. The cast shadow is completely soft-edged and fades seamlessly.</p>

<p>Think of it this way: the softness of the form shadow in soft lighting is due to the number of light sources softening the edges. If you split one light source into many and spread them out, the form is lit more evenly, and multiple cast shadows overlap to create soft edges.</p>

<h2>Occlusion Shadows</h2>

<h3>Causes and Effects</h3>

<p><strong>Occlusion shadows</strong> are soft, dark shadows that appear where none of your scattered light sources can reach. They often occur where two forms are touching each other. Even in soft lighting, there are places where light cannot penetrate.</p>

<p>You can recreate this effect by touching your finger to a wall, you'll notice the shadow gets dramatically darker right before your finger comes in contact with the wall. If objects in your paintings look floaty or not grounded, they are probably lacking occlusion shadows.</p>

<h2>Multiple Light Sources</h2>

<h3>Combination of Hard and Soft Light</h3>

<p>In realistic situations, you'll often have both hard and soft lights involved, even if there's only one key light source. For example, on a bright sunny day, the hard light of the sun creates hard-edged cast shadows, but there's also soft light and occlusion shadows because there's a second softer light source, the sky.</p>

<h3>The Sky as a Secondary Light Source</h3>

<p>The sky becomes a gigantic soft blue light source due to scattering in the atmosphere. While most of the sun's light passes directly through, some is scattered, turning the sky into a secondary light source. This scattered light affects your subject, especially in the shadow areas, because the soft sky lighting is not nearly as bright as the direct light from the sun.</p>

<h2>Reflected Light and Indirect Illumination</h2>

<h3>Importance of Reflected Light</h3>

<p>When light hits a surface, it reflects off at the same angle, but some of the light's energy is absorbed. The reflected light continues to travel until it hits another surface. This reflection accounts for a lot of the light in your world and in your paintings.</p>

<h3>Reflecting Surfaces as Light Sources</h3>

<p>For instance, the ground can reflect light back onto your subject, acting as a secondary light source. Adding a floor under a figure changes the shadow areas completely, making them brighter and softer. The floor itself has become a secondary light source as the light from the sun hits the floor and bounces back upwards into your figure.</p>

<p>This addition of <strong>reflected light</strong> is key to making the lighting in your paintings look real and vibrant.</p>

<h3>Interior Scene Example</h3>

<p>Consider an interior scene:</p>

<ul>

<li>

<p><strong>Without reflected light</strong>, you see the direct light from windows, but the rest of the room is black because the light isn't reflecting.</p>

</li>

<li>

<p><strong>Adding soft light</strong> from the sky improves this somewhat, but the room still feels dark and unrealistic.</p>

</li>

<li>

<p><strong>Allowing the light to reflect once</strong> makes the scene feel more believable. Light hitting the floor illuminates the walls and ceiling.</p>

</li>

<li>

<p><strong>Allowing the light to reflect multiple times</strong> fills the space with soft light and creates occlusion shadows. The light reflects repeatedly between surfaces, losing energy with each reflection, until it's completely expended.</p>

</li>

</ul>

<p>When painting interiors, you can approximate this lighting by understanding where the direct light hits first and how it reflects onto other surfaces. The first reflection is the most important and most visible. Subsequent reflections lose energy and brightness but contribute to the overall illumination.</p>

<h2>Practical Application in Painting</h2>

<h3>Approximating Complex Lighting</h3>

<p>In practice, you can't calculate all the reflections and interactions of light in your scene, but understanding how light works allows you to make accurate approximations.</p>

<p>Consider these questions when painting:</p>

<ul>

<li>

<p><strong>How bright is the light source?</strong></p>

</li>

<li>

<p><strong>How close is the light source?</strong></p>

</li>

<li>

<p><strong>What direction is the light traveling in?</strong></p>

</li>

</ul>

<p>These questions help you figure out how almost any light source will behave in your painting.</p>

<h3>Incorporating Reflected Light</h3>

<p>Thoughtfully considering reflected light can make your paintings much more vibrant. Remember, light reflects off surfaces and continues to illuminate others. Incorporating this into your work adds realism and depth.</p>

<h2>Assignment</h2>

<p>Your assignment for this lesson is to <strong>paint more light</strong>.</p>

<ul>

<li>

<p><strong>Easy Challenge:</strong> Do some painting studies of the provided references while focusing on the topics from this lesson.</p>

</li>

<p><strong>Intermediate Challenge:</strong> Paint some of your own subjects from life. You can use photo references too, but your eyes are better than a camera, and you'll get more out of painting from life.</p>

</li>

<li>

<p><strong>Advanced Challenge:</strong> Take one of the provided references and add a new light source from imagination. Or, if you're feeling brave, change the lighting completely.</p>

</li>

</ul>

<p>You've covered a lot of complex information here, which can feel overwhelming. But a little practice armed with knowledge can elevate your paintings faster than you can imagine. Good luck with your assignment, and see you in the next lesson.</p>
