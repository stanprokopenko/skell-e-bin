<h2>Addressing the Solar Punk Aspect</h2>

<p>I'm thinking about the <strong>solar punk</strong> aspect of my illustration. I took a photo that encapsulates the feeling I want to go for. To include the <strong>plant element</strong> of a solar punk illustration, I need to study some plants.</p>

<h2>Studying and Memorizing Plants</h2>

<p>Plants are fun and useful to <strong>copy and paste</strong> everywhere. Once you <strong>memorize interesting plants</strong> that you gravitate towards, you can stick them in your long-term memory. They're always a fun decoration, especially if you don't know what to do. Sometimes, adding plants can spark something else.</p>

<p>When studying plants, compared to more volumetric shapes, it's a lot more about <strong>memorizing patterns</strong>.</p>

<h2>Examples of Plant Structures</h2>

<p>I see several types of plants, but they're all using the same leaf shape. Let's study a few of them.</p>

<h3>Uniform Leaf Structures</h3>

<p>In some plants, we can have a straight-up <strong>line with two leaves on the side</strong>. This piece of foliage can be slapped anywhere to add visual interest.</p>

<p>Sometimes, within the composition, I need to <strong>add noise</strong> to make white space disappear. If there's too much negative space behind a character, you might be more drawn to it than the character because it's too wide open. To move your eye around and get you to look at what I want you to see, I'll add these kind of more boring noise elements to facilitate that.</p>

<h3>Clumped Leaves</h3>

<p>Some plants have leaves that <strong>go in patches</strong>, but the shape is slightly rounder. They look like they have <strong>patch shapes</strong> in separation on the twig. Compared to the uniform one, it's fine to have the leaves <strong>floating around</strong> it.</p>

<p>Visually, I can't see the wood or the stick that's connecting from the main branch to these leaves. That's useful to know because it means that rather than drawing all the connections between the leaves, it's fine to draw them in patches around each other. It doesn't matter since you can't see them.</p>

<h3>Leaf Groupings</h3>

<p>In some areas, I see <strong>tri-shaped leaves</strong>, which is a good shape to remember when adding foliage to a piece. If I'm not thinking of specific plant shapes based off a real plant, I might just draw a bundle of leaves, and it turns into a mess because I don't really know what I'm doing. Memorizing these relationships can add a lot more <strong>intention behind those leaf shapes</strong> that you add. That alone adds a sense of realism and gravity to the piece.</p>

<h2>Observations on Plant Shapes</h2>

<p>I'm noticing that leaves tend to be in <strong>groups of at least three</strong>. If I were to go back and look at my notes, I would easily understand the concept of drawing a plant that's divided this way. Sometimes drawing the <strong>pot itself</strong> helps to show the relationship between the plant and space.</p>

<p>It's cool if there are <strong>clumps</strong> in which multiple groups of three leaves are overlapping each other. It's not a big deal to have those bunches if you need them within a piece.</p>

<h2>Adding Variety with Different Shapes</h2>

<p>Those plants are all really similar, so let's look at some more <strong>interesting ones</strong>. In particular, if you have a lot of the same leaf shape, it can get repetitive and boring. Breaking it up with some <strong>larger, more irregular shapes</strong> is helpful to add some personality.</p>

<h3>Hairy Plant Shapes</h3>

<p>These plants, from afar, look like big hairy socks of plant fur. That might sound silly, but remembering to add a shape like this into your bouquet of decorative flowers you're adding to a piece can be useful.</p>

<p>I'm not understanding exactly how the leaves are jutting out from it, but it's reading as a very different shape. I think that shape can be useful to my practice if I want to draw something.</p>

<h3>Snake Plants</h3>

<p>Snake plants are something I'm familiar with, but it's good to take note of them. You don't always have to research something you're unfamiliar with. Sometimes, it's good to just take notes. If I use this reference sheet and have it next to me when I'm drawing, then it's just a reminder that these are elements I might want to play with. Very helpful.</p>

<h2>Tropical Plant Influence</h2>

<p>I think Singapore has that island vibe because it's an island. So some of those more <strong>tropical plants</strong> will be great to evoke that same mood.</p>

<h3>Firework-Shaped Plants</h3>

<p>These plants look almost like an <strong>explosion of a star</strong>, like a firework of leaves. They're a lot <strong>longer</strong> than the leaves we were studying before, at least three to four times longer.</p>

<p>Being aware of that ratio, as opposed to randomly doodling leaves, adds that intention I mentioned earlier where now this is a <strong>very different plant</strong>, not just a bundle of leaves.</p>

<p>Another big signature with that plant is that they have a lot more <strong>winding of a tree branch</strong>. I didn't bother drawing tree branches on the other plants because they don't have enough of a relationship for me to recognize it. Versus these ones, it's clear they have winding branches, a little bit of wood grain detail, and that the overall silhouette is like a firework.</p>

<p>Making sure that's clear within your research, the elements that define it and make each thing readable as a different plant. I'm drawing the same kind of leaf shape over and over, but looking at my reference sheet, it's clear to me that this is a very different thing than what I was working on before.</p>

<p>By filling a scene with all these different pieces, it would look like a very <strong>diverse group of plants</strong>, and that's just from breaking down this one photo.</p>

<h2>Expanding Plant Studies</h2>

<p>I took photos of some of the gardens as well, where there's an insane number of different plants with a lot more variety. This is the sort of thing I could spend the entire class researching. For my purposes here, maybe I can just jot down the ones that I think are the most interesting.</p>

<h3>Giant Leaves with Y Shapes</h3>

<p>These giant leaves have this cool <strong>Y shape</strong>, which I didn't know before. The Y-shaped giant leaf sometimes looks like we see the inside of it on the opposite side, and there's a lot more interesting curves going on there.</p>

<p>My purpose, before I go too far on this tangent, is that just by drawing these couple doodles here, now they're an <strong>additional ingredient</strong> that I can play with.</p>

<h3>Circular and Tiny Leaves</h3>

<p>Maybe some other ones might be these <strong>more circular leaves</strong>, and even these <strong>really tiny ones</strong>. Just to give myself a wide range of options to look at later.</p>

<h4>Stems with Leaf Textures</h4>

<p>This one here, it's a lot more about the <strong>stem</strong>, and then the leaf is more of a texture to the stem. This is not about it being a good drawing. It's just about remembering the relationships between these pieces.</p>

<h4>Busy Leaves with Line Art</h4>

<p>Leaves like these can be <strong>really busy</strong> if I do them with line art. Then there are ones that almost look like they're <strong>floating leaves</strong>. I kind of remember what they look like in person.</p>

<p>In this photo, the stem is so dark that they don't really read super intensely. You get a bit of it here, but otherwise, some of these just look like they're floating. These are a very different <strong>leaf shape</strong>, which is pretty cool. They're a bit more round.</p>

<p>I'm not even going to memorize exactly what the shape is, but just the idea that I can sometimes have leaves where we get the little lines, and otherwise they kind of just float around. I'm not memorizing in this case a very clear shape. It's more of a <strong>texture</strong>, and that's frankly what I would be using this reference for.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p>Cool. Now I have a good diversity of plants that I can reference if I want to add a more organic component to my illustration.</p>
