<h2>What's in Premium?</h2>

<p>In this lesson, we tackle common challenges in drawing your name in space. You'll learn how to:</p>

<ul>

<li>Draw curved letters in perspective by echoing curves on the back plane.</li>

<li>Maintain correct proportions by drawing your name twice and connecting corresponding points.</li>

<li>Use the back plane to guide where your lines stop, ensuring your letters keep their shape as they recede.</li>

<li>Simplify complex shapes and handle symmetry in perspective.</li>

<li>Apply advanced techniques like adding depth to your composition and revealing interior spaces.</li>

<li>Enhance your drawings with shading and rendering to make letters appear three-dimensional.</li>

</ul>

<p>We also share insights and strategies from students who faced similar challenges, encouraging experimentation and problem-solving.</p>
