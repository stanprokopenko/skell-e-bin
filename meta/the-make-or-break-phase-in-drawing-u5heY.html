<p>Hey everybody, my name is Eric Gist. I'm here doing a demo at the Proko booth at WonderCon. I do comic book cover illustrations for Marvel, DC, and pretty much anyone who wants to pay me to do a comic cover illustration.</p>

<p>I want to walk you through my process of drawing a portrait, from the big shapes down to the final touches.</p>

<h2>Starting with Big Shapes</h2>

<p>I always like working from <strong>big shapes to small shapes</strong>. I start by jumping right into an <strong>envelope or scaffolding shape</strong>, where I establish everything that's going to be included in the drawing.</p>

<p>For me, the most important part at this stage isn't the accuracy of the contour, it can be pretty general. What I want is to make sure I get the <strong>height-to-width ratio</strong> correct, ensuring that the shape I draw is the same height and width ratio as whatever it is that I'm drawing, in this case, our model McKenna.</p>

<p>I take a quick measurement and see how the width compares to the height. Then, I get the sweep of the neck coming down, looking for some kind of gesture. I don't like drawing the neck completely straight because it ends up looking like a lollipop or a Pez dispenser, which is not something we want to strive for.</p>

<p>I include a little bit of the shoulders and find some way to <strong>vignette</strong> the drawing. I'm going to stick with her collar on her shirt and ignore the lanyard on her badge.</p>

<h2>Separating Hair Shape from Face Shape</h2>

<p>Next, I separate out the <strong>hair shape from the face shape</strong>, which I call silhouette one and silhouette two. Again, I keep that really general. I'm not looking for individual strands of hair or anything, I'm just looking for a big, general sort of Lego-hair wig shape.</p>

<p>Then, I separate out the <strong>left and right side of the face</strong>, or the center line. What I'm doing there is starting to look for some comparative measurement. What's this distance compared to that distance? If it were straight on, that would be equal. If it were a profile, it would obviously cease to exist. Everything else is going to be somewhere in between.</p>

<p>Now I'm looking for the <strong>brow line</strong>, <strong>nose line</strong>, and <strong>chin</strong>. Up to the top of the forehead, you are going to get <strong>perfect thirds</strong>. That establishes our brow line, or the top of the eyes. You can imagine like sunglasses, it would be the frame on the sunglasses.</p>

<h2>Adding Construction Lines and Rhythms</h2>

<p>I'm going to start looking for some <strong>rhythms</strong>. I've got a forehead rhythm here, sort of made popular by a guy named Frank Riley, who taught at the Art Students League in the first half of the 20th century. It's just a way to simply break down the head.</p>

<p>I can get in here and establish the <strong>placement of the features</strong> with these placeholder rhythms, without having to worry about drawing an eye. I sweep down to the nose, the base of the nose is going to be on that middle third, and then again down to the chin. The laugh line rhythm follows around a muscular rhythm for the orbicularis oris. The names aren't really important, but that's what it represents.</p>

<p>Then I add <strong>side plane rhythms</strong>, two of them, actually. One for the side of the cranium, and one for the side of the face.</p>

<h2>Checking and Adjusting the Drawing</h2>

<p>Now I'm adjusting my contour, my big shape, to make it look a little more specifically like her, looking for her specific angles now that I have most everything on the board and in play.</p>

<p>There's a slight bit of an up tilt from the brow to the nose. It's going to wrap around the head to get that ear placement, that was pretty close. Maybe narrow up that neck just a little bit. She has a long, thin neck, very graceful. So that's part of her character type, and we want to capture that.</p>

<p>I look for the placement of the mouth. Usually, that part in the lips is going to be about a third of the way from the bottom of the nose to the chin. Then the mental labial sulcus, that deepest depression, will be another third. That varies quite a bit from person to person, but it's a good place to start. And she looks like she falls pretty well into that.</p>

<p>So now I look for her mouth type, a nice sort of prototypical cupid's bow shape to her upper lip.</p>

<h2>Moving into the Two-Value Phase</h2>

<p>I'm taking a second to see if there's anything jumping right out at me that I can correct. Each phase of the drawing is a good place to pause for a second and be analytical about your drawing and not just push forward. I want to make any changes that I notice. It's certainly not going to be perfect, but if there's anything that jumps right out at me, I want to make those changes now.</p>

<p>Maybe it'd be a good time to get in there and be a little more specific with the hair shape, looking at my spacing and placing to see that everything is on track. It's looking pretty good.</p>

<p>Now I've got the rhythms established. Everything's in play, seems placed pretty well. I'm going to be moving into the <strong>two-value phase</strong> of the drawing.</p>

<h2>The Importance of Squinting</h2>

<p>Those of you who have read books on drawing or taken an academic drawing class, or I'm sure even in a lot of the Proko videos, they'll tell you to <strong>squint</strong>. This is the phase where it's really important. Squint at the model, focus your eyes on your drawing, and try to get an accurate two-value representation of what you are looking at.</p>

<p>So that's what I'm going to do now. I'm going to squint my eyes down at McKenna, and then I'm going to look at my board and start coming in and, very generally using the side of my pencil, try to simplify her eye down into a dark shape.</p>

<p>The lighting here in the convention center, it's not bad, but it's not ideal. So I'm having to dig a little bit more for those dark shapes. But once you get some experience under your belt, it doesn't really matter that much. You'll start to be able to identify the shadows more easily.</p>

<h2>Simplifying Shadows and Shapes</h2>

<p>I'm keeping it very general, again, like what I see when I squint. Very simple eye shape, and that feels pretty good to me. Everything is relative in drawing, so I won't know how good that eye is until I start getting everything else in there, but it seems pretty reasonable.</p>

<p>As the drawing goes on, I get more and more specific. You want to avoid being too specific early on because you want to give yourself some room to bring it into focus and also make adjustments. If you get really specific, your ability to make adjustments is very difficult. If things are general, I can carve into them and add onto them fairly easily. But if I go in there and really outline everything and make it solidified, my tendency will be to not want to change things because it's very hard to change them.</p>

<h2>Thoughts on the Most Important Stage of Drawing</h2>

<p><em>Do you think this is the most important stage of the drawing?</em></p>

<p>In my opinion, it is. I mean, they're all important, but to me, this is usually the sort of line in the sand in a drawing where you can't let anything slide. Up until this point, I'm willing to kind of let things sit a little bit because you can get caught up in constantly revising your drawing. Not that you shouldn't pay a lot of attention to that, but up until this point, it's usually to me sort of a "I'm not sure, I think that's right, or I think that's wrong, but I'm going to put a pin in it and just make a mental note."</p>

<p>And then once I get to this phase, I revisit all of those things that I've stuck pins in throughout the course of the drawing to make sure that it's looking right. To me, this is really where you're defining the drawing. You're not going to be able to make it substantially better or worse after this phase. As you render it, it's just going to become more of what it already is.</p>

<p>Probably a better term rather than the most important, I would say it's the <strong>make or break phase</strong> of the drawing.</p>

<h2>Dividing Values and Building Up the Drawing</h2>

<p>Now I'm going into that two-value, and I am starting to bring out a greater value range. So I'm going into my <strong>dark shapes</strong>, and dividing those up into two or three values. Then I'll go into my <strong>light shapes</strong> and divide those up into two or three values so that I end up with, say, a five or six value drawing, which honestly is usually enough. You don't need many more values than that.</p>

<p>I'd say that's one of the biggest mistakes that young artists make, they over-render, using too many values. Focus on the powerful statement, the big statement. And then if you want to bring in more values, if you choose to bring in more values later on in the drawing, then yeah, great, that's your jam, that's what you're into, detailed rendering, all that. And there's absolutely nothing wrong with that. I'm not criticizing at all. But don't be reliant on it. Have that be a choice of personal expression.</p>

<h2>Influences and Inspirations</h2>

<p><strong>Who are your artist influences?</strong></p>

<p>Obviously, Jeff Watts is a huge artistic influence on me. Phil Hale is another big one, he was one of the first guys that really made me want to paint. Glen Orbik, who was actually Jeff's teacher, is also another big influence on me as far as my career and the aesthetic of my work. James Bama is another big one who, it turns out, was a Riley student, but I was actually a big fan of his work before that.</p>

<p>That would probably be my Mount Rushmore, I guess: Jeff Watts, Glen Orbik, Phil Hale, James Bama. If, for some reason, some crazy person wanted to carve a Mount Rushmore of my artistic influences.</p>

<h2>Thoughts on Art Education and Career</h2>

<p><strong>Should somebody go to art school or not?</strong></p>

<p>I can speak from my personal experience, and I know that I never would've gotten to where I was without the environment of Watts Atelier. But I think that's somewhat individualistic, and also relative to what your goals are. I certainly don't think it's going to hurt. And if you want to go in any kind of an academic direction, meaning more representational, then yeah, you're definitely going to want to be in there. And a creative environment with like-minded people is always beneficial.</p>

<p>It can be very lonely as an artist because not a lot of people get it. I don't want to aggrandize artists or what they do because all things are important. But as an artist, there aren't a lot of people that you can sit and be honest with because most people don't want to hear honesty that it's like, "Look, it's really hard." There's as much academic to it as almost any other field of study.</p>

<p>What they want to hear is, "Oh yeah, I was just born, and I was good at it, and so I'm an artist, that's what I am." The truth is, it's a lot of hard work.</p>

<p>So being in an environment with other people that like doing it as well, and you can share the work with, you know, there's sort of a misery-loves-company type of thing, although I don't think it's misery. Studying is very, very hard, and it can be lonely. So it can be nice to sit down with other artists and be able to commiserate, and bounce things off of people who have a shared experience.</p>

<p><strong>If somebody wants to become an artist but they're not sure if they want to do it professionally, do you have any thoughts on that?</strong></p>

<p>I would say just work on the <strong>fundamentals</strong> and develop your skills as broadly and solidly as possible so that once you do decide what you want to do, you've got the skills there to pursue it.</p>

<p>I think it's good to have dreams and goals and role models, but don't get locked in too early to what you think your career is going to be because life changes on you real fast. Like, I didn't even know I wanted to be a painter when I first started school.</p>

<p>I developed my skills, I even took painting classes fairly early on at Watts Atelier, even though I didn't know I wanted to be a painter yet, just because I thought it would be a good skill to have. Who knows? Maybe I would want to color my own comics, and that would be a useful skill to have. I just wanted a good broad base to build off of.</p>

<p>Jeff was the same way, actually. For a long time, Jeff tried just about everything under the sun in his twenties, as far as art goes. Eventually, he decided that being an easel painter and a teacher was where he wanted to be, that's where his passion was. And so that's what he did. But he did illustration, he did some concept design, he did inking, he did painting, he tried just kind of everything at one time or another.</p>

<p>So that's the way I would recommend approaching it if you're not sure what you want to do. Treat it like college. First two years, some people don't even declare a major, or if they do, they're not taking a lot of classes in their major, it's mostly general ed. That's one of the things college gets right, keep a good broad base, and then when you decide what you want to do, you'll be prepared for it.</p>

<h2>Thoughts on Staying on the Path</h2>

<p><strong>Do you have any thoughts on keeping on the path?</strong></p>

<p>Trust the path and those who have walked it before you. That would be my biggest piece of advice to anyone who wants to do anything. When someone who does what you want to do gives you advice, you don't have to do everything that they say, but listen. If multiple people who are where you want to go tell you the same thing, they're not lying to you. So trust them.</p>

<p>Discover the path by listening to those who have walked it before you, and then walk that path and just trust that it's going to get you where you need to go.</p>

<p>For example, if I read a book by Norman Rockwell and he gives me advice and says, "Hey, this is what you need to do," I'm going to listen to it. And if I'm not willing to do what he recommends, I need to accept that I'm not going to ever get to where he got to.</p>

<p>The guy sacrificed a lot. His kids would open up Christmas presents on Christmas morning, and he would go out and work for eight hours in the studio. Christmas, I'm taking Christmas off. But because of that, I'm probably not going to get as good as Rockwell. But what I do is I listen to that and I acknowledge that work ethic, and I see how dedicated he was to what he did. And if I want to even approach his greatness, I'm going to have to sacrifice a lot.</p>

<p>Other people don't realize that when you want to do something difficult, you have to give up a lot of other things. You can have anything you want, but you can't have everything that you want. So when you have your goals in life, you're going to have to sacrifice other parts of your life.</p>

<p>Because I have to spend time in the studio, I have to meet deadlines, I have to make the best product that I can.</p>

<h2>Final Touches and Bringing Focus</h2>

<p>I'm going in and removing some of those construction lines, I feel like they were aging her a little bit. We've got multiple light sources in here, so we've got some crazy highlights going on. I'm trying to narrow it down to what I think are the best ones.</p>

<p>I'm probably closing in on the end of this. It's kind of getting to that point where I either wrap it up or I spend another two hours on it.</p>

<p><strong>If you were to have two hours and finish it, what were the things you'd tighten in on?</strong></p>

<p>I'd build up the halftones a lot more. But doing that now would just start to create a patchiness that you have to commit to because once again, it's all relative. You start adding another layer of value, then you've got to add another layer of value, and another layer of value. There's no such thing as adding just one more layer, it ends up being five layers.</p>

<p>So that would be a lot of it. I might try to push into more of a full value range, which maybe I'll do that in one little area here.</p>

<p>So to create that <strong>focal point</strong> that we're always chasing. And then as we move away from that focal point, we allow it to become just a little bit less. Now, see that? That brings some nice attention to those eyes.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p>So I think I'll go ahead and probably call that done. One last thing, we'll get in there, everyone's favorite part of the drawing, and we'll go ahead and call that done.</p>

<p>Thank you, McKenna, for modeling. That was great, a lot of fun.</p>
