<h2>What's in Premium?</h2>

<p>Learn to break down the leg into thigh, knee, and lower leg forms and see the knee as its own structure. We detail how to use tapered tubes, S-curves, and subtle overlaps to create smooth transitions. Youâ€™ll also see how to capture variations like bulged calves and bowed shins. Everything is broken down clearly so you can draw natural-looking legs from the side view.</p>
