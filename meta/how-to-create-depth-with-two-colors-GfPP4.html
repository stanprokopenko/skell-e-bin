<p>A <strong>complementary palette</strong> involves using colors that are opposite each other on the color wheel. For example, yellow's complement is purple, and red's complement is a specific green directly across the wheel. Using a complementary palette means you can access all levels of saturation through these two colors. This approach is similar to changing from warm to cool via saturation. </p>

<p><strong>Benefits</strong> of using a complementary palette include:

- Creating dynamic and visually appealing contrasts.

- Simplifying the color choices while maintaining a full range of hues.

- Enhancing the depth and realism of your painting.</p>

<h2>Setting Up the Painting</h2>

<p>For this demonstration, we'll choose a more complex subject than a simple sphere. Let's paint a scene with a bridge, grass, and a monster. </p>

<ol>

<li><strong>Create a new canvas</strong>: Set the dimensions to 1500 pixels wide and 1200 pixels tall.</li>

<li><strong>Quick sketch</strong>: Draw the environment, including the bridge, grass, and a simplified monster.</li>

<li><strong>Set the line drawing to multiply mode</strong>: This allows you to paint on the background layer without losing the sketch.</li>

<li><strong>Choose two colors for the complementary palette</strong>: We'll use orange and blue. Sunlight is often orange, and shadows are often blue, making this a realistic choice.</li>

<li><strong>Decide on the light source</strong>: We'll use a warm light (orange).</li>

</ol>

<h2>Painting Techniques</h2>

<ol>

<li><strong>Replace the white of the canvas</strong>: Use a more decisive color to avoid the starkness of white.</li>

<li><strong>Block in the background and character</strong>: Use blue for the background and a more orangey tone for the character. Paint the bridge with a less saturated orange.</li>

<li><strong>Hide the line drawing</strong>: Focus on painting without the sketch lines.</li>

<li><strong>Invent light direction</strong>: Assume light is coming from the right. Separate the monster into light and shadow using warm and cool colors.</li>

<li><strong>Block in shadows</strong>: Use a desaturated blue for shadows. Start with an airbrush for large areas, then switch to a chalky brush for more definitive strokes.</li>

<li><strong>Adjust saturation</strong>: Darken value without changing the lightness by adjusting saturation. Use scumbling to add neutralized blue shadows for a range of color temperatures.</li>

</ol>

<h2>Enhancing the Painting</h2>

<ol>

<li><strong>Use overlay mode in Photoshop</strong>: Mix colors and create realistic light effects.</li>

<li><strong>Flip the canvas horizontally</strong>: Spot mistakes and adjust the composition.</li>

<li><strong>Paint over mistakes</strong>: Maintain a sketchy mindset rather than using undo.</li>

<li><strong>Vary edge, line width, and softness</strong>: Maintain form and light in stones and other elements.</li>

<li><strong>Add ambient occlusion</strong>: Create shadows where ambient light is blocked.</li>

<li><strong>Use brush settings</strong>: Add noise and texture to the background. Create a detailed environment with small shapes.</li>

<li><strong>Play with color temperature</strong>: Enhance depth by graying off blue to warm it up, simulating warmer leaves.</li>

</ol>

<h2>Final Touches and Tips</h2>

<ol>

<li><strong>Refine shapes and add detail</strong>: Focus on adding detail, not just small elements.</li>

<li><strong>Paint occlusion shadows</strong>: Vary the strength and edge of shadows between stones.</li>

<li><strong>Treat stones as 3D objects</strong>: Each stone should have its own planes and catch light effects.</li>

<li><strong>Enhance depth</strong>: Use blue for skylight and orange for occlusion shadows.</li>

<li><strong>Build a balanced palette</strong>: Create a bridge between warm and cool colors.</li>

<li><strong>Add catch light</strong>: Define the roundness of the monster's mouth and cheeks.</li>

<li><strong>Modify the background</strong>: Darken behind the monster's silhouette to enhance focus.</li>

<li><strong>Increase contrast</strong>: Darken occlusion shadows in the bridge for realism.</li>

<li><strong>Use atmospheric perspective</strong>: Reduce contrast to indicate distance.</li>

<li><strong>Exaggerate bounce light</strong>: Mimic real-life effects by exaggerating bounce light.</li>

<li><strong>Maintain focus</strong>: Keep warms and cools less extreme in non-focal areas.</li>

<li><strong>Indicate reflections in water</strong>: Use horizontal strokes.</li>

<li><strong>Avoid outlining</strong>: Maintain the effect of light and form.</li>

<li><strong>Be brave with temperature shifts</strong>: Enhance the palette with bold temperature changes.</li>

<li><strong>Add color notes</strong>: Sweeten the palette and add creativity. The amount depends on personal taste.</li>

<li><strong>Focus on color use</strong>: Prioritize color use over exact drawing.</li>

</ol>

<p>Consider the study finished when the overall palette is complete. This exercise helps you practice and experiment with color, making future decisions easier.</p>
