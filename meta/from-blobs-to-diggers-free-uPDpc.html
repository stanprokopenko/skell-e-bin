<h2>What's in Premium?</h2>

<p>In the premium lesson, you'll learn how to draw diggers using simple shapes like <strong>blobs</strong> and <strong>rubber bands</strong> to create three-dimensional forms. Starting with side and front views, we'll use blobs to represent the digger in 3D, wrapping rubber bands around them to establish orientation and slice off planes for clarity. You'll explore how to understand perspective by drawing diggers from different angles and using multiple vanishing points.</p>

<p>We'll also discuss the limits of blobs and how adding a grid can help position characters accurately in a scene. By combining forms and wrapping rubber bands around each shape, you'll see how to turn blobs into clear, directional formsâ€”a technique often used by cartoonists and animators. Plus, we'll encourage you to sketch various ideas, create characters, and understand the role of perspective in cartoons.</p>
