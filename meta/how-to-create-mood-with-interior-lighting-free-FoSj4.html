<h2>What's in Premium?</h2>

<p>In this lesson on <strong>Painting Interiors: Lighting and Atmosphere</strong>, you'll learn how to approach interior scenes differently from exteriors by making deliberate choices about <strong>light sources</strong>â€”both <strong>electric and natural</strong>. We'll discuss how factors like <strong>window placement</strong>, <strong>time of day</strong>, and <strong>ambient occlusion</strong> affect the mood and depth of your scene.</p>

<p>You'll discover how to <strong>plan your scene</strong> starting with a simple sketch or by <strong>mocking it up in 3D software</strong> to establish accurate perspective. We'll cover <strong>blocking in values</strong> to set the overall lighting mood, and how to build up the lighting using layers and blending modes like <strong>"Linear Dodge (Add)"</strong> for glowing effects.</p>

<p>The lesson also explores adding <strong>focal points</strong> to your scene, considering <strong>materials</strong> and <strong>specular highlights</strong>, and introducing <strong>local color</strong> that feels natural within your lighting context. You'll learn techniques for refining details so your scene reads clearly, even without line art.</p>

<p>Finally, we'll experiment with <strong>additional light sources</strong> to enhance your composition and discuss how different lighting setups can change the mood and focus of your scene.</p>
