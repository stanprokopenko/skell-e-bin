<h2>The Birth of Perspective</h2>

<p>Perspective began <strong>600 years ago</strong> in Italy with the <strong>Florentines</strong>. It spread worldwide and now influences everyone, even those unaware of its principles.</p>

<h2>Renaissance Innovations</h2>

<h3>Paolo Uccello</h3>

<p>In the 15th century, <strong>Paolo Uccello</strong> produced works that seem modern, <strong>500 years before computers</strong>. His methods with ellipses and circles will be studied later.</p>

<h3>Leonardo da Vinci</h3>

<p><strong>Leonardo da Vinci</strong> taught us:</p>

<ul>

<li>Mastery through <strong>preliminary work</strong>.</li>

<li>The charm of <strong>unfinished art</strong>.</li>

<li>Effective <strong>storytelling</strong>.</li>

</ul>

<p>He used <strong>grids</strong> to place figures in imaginary space, combining creativity and technical skill.</p>

<p>Renaissance artists drew objects from all sides, allowing depiction in any position. This approach was both educational and experimental.</p>

<h2>European Expansion</h2>

<h3>Albrecht Dürer</h3>

<p>In Germany, <strong>Albrecht Dürer</strong> not only drew but also <strong>explained perspective</strong>. He showed how <strong>light beams form dots</strong>, which connect to create perspective images.</p>

<h3>Hans Vredeman de Vries</h3>

<p>Dutch artist <strong>Hans Vredeman de Vries</strong> focused on:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>One-point</strong> and <strong>two-point</strong> perspectives.</li>

<li>Importance of <strong>horizon lines</strong>.</li>

<li>Objects <strong>projecting</strong> or <strong>receding</strong>.</li>

</ul>

<p>His work offers great <strong>practice exercises</strong>. Try drawing scenes and tracking characters in space.</p>

<h2>19th and 20th Century Developments</h2>

<p>By the 17th century, perspective was standard education for artists.</p>

<p>In the <strong>19th century</strong>, photography emerged. <strong>Impressionists</strong> emphasized light, <strong>Expressionists</strong> manipulated perspective.</p>

<p><strong>Japanese woodblock artists</strong>, like <strong>Hiroshi Yoshida</strong>, excelled in perspective, depicting both structures and nature flawlessly.</p>

<p>Though fine art institutions later neglected perspective, it thrived among <strong>comic artists, animators, illustrators</strong>, and <strong>designers</strong>. <strong>M.C. Escher</strong> created stunning pre-computer perspective works.</p>

<h2>Legacy and Exploration</h2>

<p>Perspective remains vital. Explore inspiring artists. <strong>Countless treasures await.</strong></p>
