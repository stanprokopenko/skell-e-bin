<h2>What's in Premium?</h2>

<p>In the premium lesson, we welcome Karl Kopinski for a sketchbook tour. Karl shares his latest artwork and insights into his creative process. You'll learn about his experiments with Prismacolor pencils, his techniques for quick sketches and character studies, and his approach to drawing without underdrawing. He discusses challenges like drawing feminine features and helmets without reference, and the importance of observing people to capture subtle differences in bone structure. Karl also introduces his new art book, <em>The Big Kopinski</em>, featuring a collection of his sketches and paintings.</p>
