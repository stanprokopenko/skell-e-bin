<h2>What's in Premium?</h2>

<p>In the premium lesson, you'll learn how to paint a realistic ear step by step. Starting with a warm color wash using <strong>cadmium red orange</strong>, you'll establish a vibrant base. You'll create a rough gesture drawing with colorized lines, anchoring the ear's placement by sketching the back line of the jaw and cheekbone.</p>

<p>You'll define the ear's structures using hook shapes and balance <strong>straights against curves</strong> for a strong design. The lesson guides you through mapping lights and darks to establish form, blocking in local colors for skin, earrings, and hair, and adding midtones and highlights to bring the ear to life.</p>

<p>You'll refine your painting using the <strong>blender brush</strong> to soften edges and enhance <strong>subsurface scattering</strong> in translucent areas. The lesson covers pushing highlights and dark accents for depth and realism, and adding final touches like subtle textures and balancing brushstrokes. A recap of ear anatomy reinforces your understanding of the forms you're painting.</p>
