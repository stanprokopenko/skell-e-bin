<p>In this final demo, I want to share how I take gesture drawings to the next level. A common question I hear is, "I've enjoyed learning gesture drawing, but what do I do with it?" This is just the beginning. Gesture sets you up for a deeper understanding of anatomical design.</p>

<p>My approach is very process-oriented. I'll walk you through my steps and explain why I do them, so you can decide if this method works for you. Keep in mind, I gave you two approaches earlier: the shape-based approach and this one. They both lead to different places. This method is about construction. It's hyper-analytical so I can invent and understand everything in the figure.</p>

<h2>Step 1: Gesture Drawing</h2>

<p>I always begin with a <strong>gesture drawing</strong>. You have plenty of instruction and examples on how to do this from previous lessons. Remember, no one will ever see this initial gesture, it serves as the foundation. These loose rhythms and lines are not meant to be the final lines in your drawing. They're inside the figure, helping me work out the anatomy.</p>

<p>My lines are <strong>scratchy and loose</strong>. They're not supposed to be direct or look like the finish line. I'm not sure where the finish line will be yet. Some might say I should have greater economy and only draw when I know it. That's another approach, and you can mix and match methods to create something that works for you.</p>

<h2>Step 2: Tilts and Shapes of Skeletal Masses</h2>

<p>Next, I focus on the <strong>tilts and shapes of the skeletal masses</strong>. Every step builds on the last, much like a family tree. The worst thing you can do is <strong>"kill your grandparents"</strong>, which means neglecting or countering a previous step. Each step is meant to advance the last.</p>

<p>I'm thinking about the <strong>three core masses</strong>: <strong>head</strong>, <strong>rib cage</strong>, and <strong>pelvis</strong>. I organize them on tilts to avoid creating a static figure. The gesture helps me understand the <strong>directional antagonisms of the spine</strong>, so I don't end up with a stiff pose.</p>

<p>All core masses exist on tilts:</p>

<ul>

<li>The <strong>pelvis</strong> has a tilt based on the weight distribution.</li>

<li>The <strong>rib cage</strong> tilts to counterbalance the pelvis.</li>

<li>The <strong>neck and head</strong> adjust according to the rib cage.</li>

</ul>

<p>Tilts can also act as the <strong>major axes of an ellipse</strong>. This helps me maintain the tilt, rise, and fall of each mass and keeps the drawing feeling solid.</p>

<h2>Step 3: C and S Curves at Intersections</h2>

<p>We often avoid drawing intersections like the neck, shoulder, elbow, waist, hip, and knee. To address this, I use <strong>C and S curves</strong> on areas of intersection. I draw them as either a <strong>T overlap</strong> or a <strong>wrapping line</strong>.</p>

<ul>

<li>A <strong>T overlap</strong> shows which form is in front and which is behind.</li>

<li>A <strong>wrapping line</strong> acts like a rubber band wrapping around the form, emphasizing contour.</li>

</ul>

<p>By using these methods, I avoid outlining the figure with a single line. Instead, I create lines that involve the viewer inside the form. This transforms drawings from being flat to having much more depth.</p>

<p>For example, between the rib cage and pelvis:</p>

<ul>

<li>On the <strong>pinched side</strong>, I use a <strong>C curve</strong> to show compression.</li>

<li>On the <strong>stretched side</strong>, I use an <strong>S curve</strong> to show elongation.</li>

</ul>

<p>The <strong>C and S curves</strong> are also how I'll be developing muscle later on, so this is a good early lesson to keep in mind.</p>

<h2>Step 4: Adding Landmarks</h2>

<p>Once I'm comfortable, I add <strong>landmarks</strong>. These are the points of bone visible through the skin, like the <strong>sternal notch</strong>, <strong>sternum</strong>, <strong>belly button</strong>, and <strong>pubic symphysis</strong>. Landmarks help me customize the position of my shapes and understand the <strong>rotation of the core masses</strong>.</p>

<p>By plotting these landmarks, I can see how the figure is rotating in space. This is crucial for figure invention, allowing me to create and invent figures without relying solely on reference.</p>

<p>I do the same for the limbs, identifying landmarks like the <strong>clavicle</strong>, <strong>acromion process</strong>, <strong>scapula</strong>, <strong>humerus</strong>, <strong>ulna</strong>, <strong>radius</strong>, <strong>greater trochanter</strong>, <strong>patella</strong>, <strong>tibia</strong>, and <strong>fibula</strong>.</p>

<p>Landmarks provide a design-based equivalent for the skeleton, so I don't have to draw the entire skeleton.</p>

<h2>Step 5: Constructing 3D Perspectives</h2>

<p>Before adding muscles, I need to understand the <strong>3D perspectives</strong> of the forms. I connect the landmarks to find planes:</p>

<ul>

<li>The <strong>front plane of the rib cage</strong> connects the 10th ribs across to the pit of the neck.</li>

<li>I then find the <strong>depth</strong> to create a box representing the rib cage.</li>

</ul>

<p>I match the <strong>tilts</strong> established earlier to construct boxes for the rib cage and pelvis. This method ensures I don't "kill my grandparents" by countering previous steps.</p>

<p>Boxes are hard to draw, but by problem-solving earlier and keeping lines consistent and parallel, I create solid forms. This allows me to <strong>stack muscles</strong> on top with confidence.</p>

<p>For the limbs, I use <strong>cylinders or boxes</strong> depending on the form:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Cylinders</strong> are useful but can be challenging for showing clear front, side, and back.</li>

<li><strong>Boxes</strong> give more defined planes, especially helpful for areas like the arm, which rotates and spins.</li>

</ul>

<p>At this point, I have a solid <strong>figure construction</strong> and can start adding muscles.</p>

<h2>Step 6: Applying Anatomy</h2>

<p>Finally, I move on to <strong>anatomy</strong>. I approach anatomy with the <strong>three Ps</strong>:</p>

<ol>

<li><strong>Part</strong>: Every muscle or area has its own shape.</li>

<li><strong>Position</strong>: Where the muscle begins and ends, accounting for <strong>stretch</strong> or <strong>pinch</strong>.</li>

<li><strong>Perspective</strong>: How the muscle wraps around the surface and its volumetric qualities.</li>

</ol>

<p>For instance, the <strong>sternocleidomastoid</strong> muscle attaches at the mastoid process, wraps across the neck, and extends to the sternal notch. By understanding its part, position, and perspective, I can accurately depict it.</p>

<p>I think of muscles as <strong>shapes and patterns</strong>. The <strong>chest muscle</strong> resembles a goldfish without a head. It starts at the sternum and connects to the humerus. Depending on the arm's position, the chest muscle either <strong>stretches</strong> (forming an <strong>S curve</strong>) when the arm is raised or <strong>pinches</strong> (forming a <strong>C curve</strong>) when the arm is lowered.</p>

<p>Contour lines at this stage must express both <strong>gesture</strong> and <strong>construction</strong>. This ensures the muscles feel believable and integrated into the figure.</p>

<p>By starting generally and building up, I can decide where to focus detail and rendering. Not every muscle needs full rendering, especially if it doesn't serve the story or action of the pose.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p>This comprehensive process takes gesture drawing to a fully realized figure with anatomical accuracy. Each step builds upon the last, ensuring a solid foundation. Once you've internalized these steps, you can collapse them, much like layers in Photoshop. The goal is to understand the figure so well that you can express all of these concepts with confident, finished marks.</p>

<p>Remember, drawing is a journey of construction and understanding. By following this process, you can develop figures that are dynamic, solid, and anatomically accurate.</p>
