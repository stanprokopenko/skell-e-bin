<h2>Focus on the Focal Point</h2>

<p>When I started out, I struggled with keeping the <strong>focus of each panel</strong> in mind. It's crucial to make your panels dynamic while <strong>guiding the reader's eye</strong> to the main focal point. Don't get too caught up in less important aspects and end up with something that feels <strong>flat</strong> and lacks depth.</p>

<h2>Create Depth and Dynamics</h2>

<p>To avoid flatness, <strong>push the foreground and background elements</strong> further apart. This gives your images more depth, and makes them more interesting. It's not just about rendering details, even with flat colors, separating the planes can greatly enhance the dynamism of your panels.</p>

<h2>Study and Practice Relentlessly</h2>

<p>You need to be studying <strong>color theory</strong>, looking at other comics, studying other artworks, and observing <strong>nature</strong> around you. At the same time, spend a lot of time <strong>coloring</strong>. The only way to get better and faster is to practice, and both speed and quality are important when working under deadlines.</p>

<h2>Overcome Fear of Failure</h2>

<p>One thing that held me back was a <strong>fear of failure</strong> and wanting to get it right on the first try. Don't be afraid to <strong>experiment</strong>. Put down a million marks, color a page five different ways if you can. Mistakes are part of the learning process, and you shouldn't expect perfection on the first attempt.</p>

<h2>Find Your Own Pace</h2>

<p>Some days I average <strong>five pages a day</strong>, and other professionals might do more or less. It doesn't matter as long as the <strong>end product</strong> meets your standards. When starting out, aim for <strong>one or two pages a day</strong>. Speed comes with time and experience.</p>

<h2>Push Through Creative Blocks</h2>

<p>There are days when I just don't feel it, the spark isn't there. But sometimes you have to <strong>work through it</strong>, especially when deadlines are looming. Other times, it's important to <strong>disconnect and refresh</strong> in order to get back into gear.</p>

<h2>Embrace New Tools and Techniques</h2>

<p>The introduction of new tools like <strong>Kyle Webster brushes</strong> has opened up possibilities in digital art. My process has evolved with new tools, allowing for more organic results. It's beneficial to <strong>specialize in a few tools</strong>, but don't be afraid to <strong>learn and experiment with more</strong>.</p>

<h2>Don't Limit Yourself</h2>

<p>I've tried my hand at projects outside of comics, and stepping out of my comfort zone has been <strong>rewarding</strong>. Don't limit yourself, try as many tools and styles as you're interested in. Take the time you need to learn and <strong>specialize in what helps you produce your best art</strong>.</p>

<h2>Learn from What You Love</h2>

<p>Pay attention to what you like and <strong>why you like it</strong>. When I admire a piece, I dissect it to understand the use of color and value. Use these insights to inform your own work, but focus on creating something that is uniquely <strong>yours</strong>.</p>
