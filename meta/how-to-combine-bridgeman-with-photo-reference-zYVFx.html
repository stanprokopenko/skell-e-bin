<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>I’m taking a torso pose from a photo of my model, Yoni, and I am combining what I’ve studied from Bridgman and other references to create a strong anatomical drawing. I like to think of this approach as “bridging” my knowledge from various sources, especially Bridgman, to interpret what I see and clarify forms in my drawing.</p>

<p>I begin with a simple block-in, focusing on big shapes and key landmarks: the rib cage, the pelvic region, and essential muscle groups. My goal is to map out how those muscles and bones overlap before I commit to refining edges and shading.</p>

<h2>Basic Block-In</h2>

<p>I start by lightly sketching:</p>

<p>• An oval or simple shape to represent the rib cage.<br />

• A “V” shape where the arms lift and connect to the torso.<br />

• The sternal notch area at the center of the chest.<br />

• A rough outline down to the pelvis, keeping track of how the torso twists or bends.  </p>

<p>As I place these shapes, I think of overlaps, who’s on top, who’s behind. For instance, when arms are raised, the deltoid and the top of the pectoralis often blend into each other. I also sketch through the form, lightly indicating where the navel might sit, while keeping track of centerlines.</p>

<h2>Major Anatomical Landmarks</h2>

<p>I pay close attention to where muscles insert and overlap. Some of the big areas I keep in mind are:</p>

<p><strong>Pectoralis Muscles</strong><br />

• There are upper, middle, and lower heads of the pec.<br />

• When the arms are raised, the lower portion can stand out more.  </p>

<p><strong>Serratus and External Oblique</strong><br />

• Serratus muscles run between the ribs and appear as “fingers” along the torso’s side.<br />

• External obliques intertwine with the serratus.<br />

• This area gets visually complex with raised arms, so I map one shape at a time.  </p>

<p><strong>Abdominals</strong><br />

• The “six-pack” or rectus abdominis sometimes shows distinct separations.<br />

• The linea alba is the separation down the midline.<br />

• Below the navel, you might see a small “apple top” separation in the lower abs.  </p>

<p><strong>Inguinal Ligament</strong><br />

• This cord-like structure runs from the pelvis toward the lower abs.<br />

• It creates a defined groove in lean figures.  </p>

<p><strong>Latissimus Dorsi (Lat)</strong><br />

• Inserts up high on the humerus.<br />

• Shows more distinctly on one side depending on the pose and lighting.  </p>

<h2>Hard and Soft Edges</h2>

<p>I keep repeating a mantra of “hard under, soft on top.” With overhead lighting, upward-facing planes are often lighter and softer, while downward-facing planes get sharper shadows. This approach helps me clarify form:</p>

<p>• <strong>Hard edges</strong> where the form turns abruptly into shadow (like beneath a pronounced rib or muscle).<br />

• <strong>Soft or lost edges</strong> where the plane transitions more gradually (often on top-facing surfaces).  </p>

<p>By adjusting edge sharpness, I communicate the structure of muscles without flattening them.</p>

<h2>Establishing and Refining Values</h2>

<p>Once my shapes are mapped out, I lay in shadow shapes at about half their final darkness. I call this “placeholder shadow.” Later, I can deepen shadows to create reflected light effects:</p>

<ol>

<li>Lightly shade the larger shadow areas with a mid-tone.  </li>

<li>Identify the darkest core shadows and push them incrementally darker.  </li>

<li>Use the original placeholder tone as reflected light, rather than erasing too much.  </li>

<li>Feather edges where surfaces transition softly, and keep edges firm where the form is crisp.  </li>

<li>Blend carefully (with a finger or a stump) to avoid losing the structure I built.  </li>

</ol>

<h2>Personalizing the Finish</h2>

<p>After I’ve located everything accurately, I decide how far I want to render. Sometimes, I carry it all the way with multiple passes of darkening core shadows, refining transitions, and clarifying smaller shapes like subtle muscle striations. Other times, I do a simpler block-in focusing on main forms and call it done.</p>

<p>The finishing stage is partly about taste. Some artists like crisp, well-defined edges, while others prefer softer, more painterly transitions. As I gain confidence, I explore different styles, always keeping in mind the core principle: the drawing must communicate the structure clearly.</p>

<h2>Practice Tips</h2>

<p>• If a pose is intimidating, like arms raised overhead, begin with big shapes and gesture lines.

• Overhead lighting is ideal for learning form because it shows clear top planes and cast shadows.<br />

• Re-draw or “chisel” shapes if something seems off. A small correction early saves big headaches later.<br />

• Focus on each muscle’s geometry: how it wraps around the rib cage or overlaps the next group.<br />

• Revisit drawings like this occasionally. Each pass helps you memorize anatomy and deepen your skill.</p>

<p>This exercise is about bridging your knowledge from references (like Bridgman) to a live or photo reference, and then interpreting that information in your own drawing. I like to stay flexible, using my knowledge of anatomy as a guide rather than a set of rigid rules. Stay curious, take your time, and let each pass refine your understanding of the figure.</p>
