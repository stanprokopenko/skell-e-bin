<p>Today, I want to do a study of a skull from my skull and bones reference pack. I'll focus on simplifying complex forms, and I think skulls are perfect for that. They're an interesting combination of simple overall shapes with lots of intricate, unexpected details like divots, cutouts, and bumps.</p>

<p>I've chosen a Guinea fowl skull for this study. It has a cool crest on top that gives it a fantasy or dinosaur-like look. It's a fun shape, and I'll walk you through my thought process as I work on this painting.</p>

<h2>Setting Up the Canvas</h2>

<p>I always like to begin with a big open canvas in Photoshop. For this study, I'm going to shrink and crop my reference because I don't need the full scale or extra space. Sometimes I create a frame to work in, but to get into a more casual, loose mindset, I'll go without any frame. Instead, I'll start laying down some brushy strokes and let the edges taper out and fade in interesting ways.</p>

<h2>Starting with Big Shapes</h2>

<p>I like to begin with a simple strategy: <strong>work from big shapes to small shapes</strong>. Other than that, I start each study a little differently. I allow myself to respond to the subject without a strict formula.</p>

<p>Sometimes I'll begin with a loose sketch, which is a good idea if you're concerned with proportions and accuracy. With line drawings, you can establish and correct proportions relatively easily compared to painting. But for this painting, I want to take a traditional approach, pretending I have a really small canvas and I'm working with a broad brush. I'm going for a loose and painterly effect.</p>

<p>I keep my strokes quite broad and constantly remind myself to zoom out and look through squinted eyes. This helps me see past the little details and focus on the big shapes of value and color. I'm laying in a dark brown value and a light yellow value because those are the biggest impressions I see.</p>

<h2>Ignoring Details Initially</h2>

<p>There's a ton of intricacy and delicate features in this skull, but I'm challenging myself to ignore that initially, and for as long as I can. I focus on the <strong>big forms</strong>. I want to be relatively accurate with the values and colors, but I'm not concerned with being super accurate. Accuracy is a matter of spending time, the more time I spend, the more accurate I can make it. But I want a general accuracy, and allow myself to be fairly fast and casual. I don't want it to feel stiff or overworked, I want it to feel like a fun, spontaneous, and expressive study.</p>

<p>I'm blocking in the major form, even ignoring the huge eye socket initially. Even though it's a big feature, it's secondary to the larger form itself. It's tempting to start cutting this out, but I'm practicing restraint and patience. I imagine it's not even there, and draw the big statement instead. It's similar to how you might approach a sculpture or a 3D model, you begin with the largest, simplest statement first and then cut into it. I find that with painting, this approach leads to satisfying results.</p>

<h2>Observing Light and Color</h2>

<p>I go ahead and establish the cast shadow. <strong>A cast shadow is very important for creating the illusion of form</strong> because anything that has mass and occludes light will cast a shadow. The colors, except for the yellow, are fairly subtle. There's an interesting range of warm and cool neutral tones in the bone.</p>

<p>I'm looking at the tip of the beak and noticing it's relatively cool, reflecting the environment. Planes facing down towards the yellow surface are much warmer as they catch reflected light. These are the observations I want to make early on. To render this form and make it feel three-dimensional, I need to understand how the light is hitting it. We have a direct, neutral white light coming from above, warm yellow light reflecting off the surface, and a cool ambient light coming from outside.</p>

<p>I might punch up the surface color a bit as well. It's good to lay in the big statements you see so you can judge everything in proper relationship. Sometimes I slowly approach the extreme lights and darks, but it's also good to lay in your lightest light and darkest dark early on. This helps place all the values in between accurately in relation to those extremes.</p>

<h2>Identifying Areas of Contrast</h2>

<p>It's important to observe where the areas of <strong>highest contrast</strong> and <strong>lowest contrast</strong> are on your subject. There's quite a lot happening in that regard with this skull. There are many areas where a light value is against a very dark value. In general, we have a concentration of the brightest values toward the crest at the top of the head, and lower contrast areas in the shadows on the interior.</p>

<p>I might make this area feel the most brilliant, perhaps even be the focal point, but I have to decide as I work. I also want to be generally accurate in terms of shape and proportions, but I'm not stressing over it too much. Again, accuracy comes with spending more time and measuring carefully, but that's not high on my priority list here.</p>

<h2>Refining Before Adding Complexity</h2>

<p>I want to encourage myself to refine the shapes, edges, and details I've already placed before adding more complexity. This is something I aim to do throughout the process. Even though it's tempting to add those fun shapes I see on the interior, the more I can refine and resolve what I already have, the smoother the process will be going forward.</p>

<p>For example, there's a bit of a highlight in a certain area, and I want to pretend this surface extends and connects to another point because that's what the major form is doing. It's more efficient to zoom out when painting because you can cover more ground with less effort. When the image is small on your screen, a tiny flick of the wrist can cover the whole canvas.</p>

<h2>Adding Smaller Shapes</h2>

<p>Now that I have a lot of value and color down on my canvas, I allow myself to proceed to add the smaller shapes. Since I've delayed this gratification, it's satisfying to now carve into this big form. I like to think of it as carving, like working with a sculpture. First, I lay in the big shape, then I refine the values and edges within it.</p>

<p>Rather than thinking of myself as painting the object, it's often better to approach it as if I'm painting the <strong>impression of light reflecting off the object</strong>. It may seem like a trivial difference, but when I'm thinking about painting light instead of the object, it's more about capturing the big effect of what I'm seeing. It often leads to more spontaneous, lively effects in the painting.</p>

<h2>Using Mixer Brushes for Texture</h2>

<p>Once I have a lot of value and color down on my canvas, I like to pull out my mixer brushes. One of the beautiful things about Photoshop is the mixer brushes. The mixer brush allows you to sample from anywhere on your canvas using the brush stamp, picking up all the colors and pixels from that area, and allowing you to push them around. It gives you a very oil-like, traditional effect.</p>

<p>I think it's important as digital artists to be conscious of creating a sense of <strong>surface texture</strong>. Otherwise, digital pixels can tend to look a bit mushy if you're not conscious of it. Traditional paintings naturally have a surface texture that shows through and influences the painting. There's a natural appeal to that, a sense of texture and surface is appealing on an abstract level.</p>

<p>At a certain point, I want to allow the texture of my brush to begin to imply the smaller, more intricate surface details of the subject. I don't actually want to start <strong>noodling out all those little tiny details</strong>. If I did that, it would quickly tighten and stiffen up the painting more than what I'm after for this study.</p>

<h2>Maintaining a Loose Painterly Look</h2>

<p>As I add smaller, delicate details, I have to be careful. Sometimes even a small detail can feel like too much. I have to reiterate my self-imposed limitation of using a big, chunky brush on a small canvas. I remind myself that I'm going for a loose painterly look. Just as if I were using a really fat brush on a small canvas traditionally, there's a limit to the level of delicacy of detail that can be achieved. I want to give myself a similar sense of limitation here.</p>

<p>Even though I could grab a smaller brush and keep zooming in closer, getting as tight and precise as I want, it would ruin the vibe I'm after. It's a matter of self-imposed limitation because that's the only way to achieve the look I want. As soon as I break away from that limitation, it loses some charm and starts to feel like a direct copy of the subject, which doesn't interest me.</p>

<h2>Self-Imposed Limitations</h2>

<p>I hope I've inspired you to strategize with your paintings and studies. Try to give yourself some <strong>limitation</strong>, especially if you're aiming for a painterly look. I think it's super important. Limiting yourself can help maintain the spontaneous and expressive qualities in your work.</p>

<h2>Final Touches</h2>

<p>I'm really zooming out and squinting now, trying to add the final finishing touches. I might come back in a couple of hours with fresh eyes to reassess and apply some finishing details and refinements. I find that my work almost always benefits from that, whether I give myself a few hours or a few days to look at it fresh.</p>

<p>Just a few small touches here and there, and I'm feeling pretty satisfied with this. I'm going to zoom in a little and leave it there.</p>

<p>See ya.</p>
