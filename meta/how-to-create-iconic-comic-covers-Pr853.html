<h2>Starting Out in Comics</h2>

<p>I'm Eric Gist, also known as EMGIST. From the age of eight, I've been passionate about comics. I always wanted to draw them, initially focusing on interiors. I submitted samples monthly and collected many rejection letters. Training with Jeff Watts, I discovered my knack for single-image storytelling and began pursuing covers.</p>

<h2>My Work and Style</h2>

<p>I've created covers for <strong>Fantastic Four</strong>, <strong>Iron Fist</strong>, <strong>Wolverine</strong>, and <strong>Hulk</strong>. A favorite is the Hulk cover featuring a classic fight between Wolverine and Hulk, with a <strong>zombie Wolverine</strong> twist. The Fantastic Four cover was enjoyable due to the storytelling challenge of capturing the family dynamic in one image.</p>

<p>I'm known for <strong>deep shadows</strong>, <strong>high contrast</strong>, and a <strong>moody</strong> atmosphere, a noir or horror feel. Lately, I've explored brighter colors with characters like Fantastic Four and Iron Fist. For the Fantastic Four, I drew inspiration from <strong>Norman Rockwell</strong>, who is one of my favorite artists.</p>

<h2>Should You Specialize?</h2>

<p>I believe you should <strong>specialize at first</strong>. Excelling in one area is better than being average in many. Once established, you can branch out. Comics today favor well-rounded artists, but starting with a specialization helps you stand out.</p>

<h2>Improving Your Cover Art</h2>

<p>To improve, <strong>study artists</strong> who excel at covers, not just contemporary ones. Look at historical cover artists and narrative painters like <strong>Bouguereau</strong>, <strong>Caravaggio</strong>, and <strong>Rembrandt</strong>. <strong>Work on your fundamentals</strong> and <strong>practice by making covers</strong>. Create, even if they're bad at first, it's part of the learning process.</p>

<h2>The Importance of Fundamentals</h2>

<p>Focus on <strong>figure drawing</strong>, including basic forms, lighting, and anatomy. Understand <strong>color theory</strong>, <strong>perspective</strong>, and <strong>composition</strong>. In comics, drawing a dynamic figure is crucial. <strong>Figure and composition</strong> are key, other areas can be simpler if these are strong.</p>

<h2>Embracing Limitations</h2>

<p>Limitations foster creativity by forcing you to think differently. In films like "Alien," limitations led to imaginative solutions. Similarly, creating multiple thumbnails helps move past common ideas to original concepts. Often, the first few sketches aren't unique, so pushing past them is essential.</p>

<h2>What I Wish I Knew</h2>

<p>I wish I'd understood how skilled you need to be. Even today, I sometimes wish my work were better. Remember, our job is to sell comics, and we need to be good enough to stand alongside great artists.</p>
