<h2>What Makes a Successful Cover</h2>

<p>One of the most common questions I get is <strong>what makes a good cover</strong>. To know what makes a successful cover, we need to identify our goals.</p>

<h2>Goal 1: Make It Eye-Catching</h2>

<p><strong>Is it eye-catching? Does it stand out on the shelf?</strong> A lot of comics are sold and read online. Does the cover stand out in those libraries as well? If not, it might be a design problem. We can use <strong>compositional elements</strong> to solve this challenge:</p>

<ul>

<li>

<p><strong>Silhouette</strong>: Often the first thing we perceive from a graphic standpoint. The play of light against dark initially attracts a viewer. Do the characters have a clear silhouette that is dynamic and identifiable?</p>

</li>

<li>

<p><strong>Color</strong>: Colors play a substantial role in attracting the eye. They can harmonize or be jarring. Use color to create visual interest and mood without overloading the viewer. Do the colors pop off the shelf, or are they muddy and competing with each other?</p>

</li>

<li>

<p><strong>Rhythms</strong>: Rhythms can tie an image together and create energy. Do the rhythms guide your eye around the page? Does the composition hold your gaze? Are the characters explosive?</p>

</li>

</ul>

<p>Every cover starts as a <strong>graphic design problem</strong>. If it's not interesting or eye-catching at this point, no amount of fancy detail or rendering will save it. I like to create a sense of the iconic by focusing on silhouette and lighting. The shape of an element and how it is lit can tell the viewer a lot about how they are meant to perceive it. For instance, obscuring a figure with heavy shadow can create a feeling of unease while presenting an interesting design.</p>

<h2>Goal 2: Meet the Client's Needs</h2>

<p>Does it meet the client's needs? Aside from making it eye-catching, it's important to know what the client is looking for in terms of <strong>logo placement and trade dress</strong>. Placing the title in the right or wrong place can make or break your cover. Make sure you have a template or know what the publisher needs in terms of logo and trade dress size, placement, etc.</p>

<p>Don't be afraid to propose an interesting variation on the design elements. Ask yourself, <strong>can the logo be incorporated into the composition</strong>? Sometimes it can be fun and exciting to include the logo right in the illustration as a physical item.</p>

<p>I often use templates from the publisher in my thumbnail process so I don't back myself into a corner. Avoid placing important elements too close to the edges of the composition, and watch out for the graphic elements. If you are going to overlap the title, do it clearly and with purpose. Slight overlap can create undesired tangents.</p>

<h2>Goal 3: Tell a Story</h2>

<p><strong>Does it tell a story?</strong> ** Storytelling is difficult, it's like describing how to tell a joke. Pick a key moment that captures the spirit of the story without revealing too much, and stage it in a clear and dynamic fashion.</p>

<p>I often start with the placement of my characters and the camera, which is called <strong>staging</strong>. I might even create a little floor plan for myself. Think about <strong>proximity</strong>, not only of the characters but also of the camera. You can create a lot of tension by closing the distance between all the elements, or create a sense of ease or anticipation by opening it up.</p>

<p><strong>Ask a question</strong>, or more specifically, get the viewer to ask a question, something that compels them to pick up that comic to find out. You can have our hero backed into a corner with no apparent escape, or introduce some other mystery on the page. Who are these incapacitated soldiers lying at the feet of our protagonist? How did our hero get to this location? Why is there a purple gorilla on the cover?</p>

<p>The question doesn't always have to be combat-related, but that's definitely a go-to solution to get an exciting piece. <strong>Cover stories should punctuate with a question mark</strong>, a question that can only be answered by reading what's behind the cover.</p>

<h2>Goal 4: Sell the Book</h2>

<p>The fourth and most important goal of a cover is to <strong>sell the book</strong>.</p>

<h2>Things to Avoid</h2>

<p>A lot of young artists want to figure out how to make their artwork better. I want to start with things that we can avoid.</p>

<h3>Tangencies</h3>

<p><strong>Tangencies</strong> are when two separate elements in an illustration make an awkward touch. For instance, if you've got two things barely touching, that's a tangency. It can create visual tension within an image or flatten the image.</p>

<p>For example, in a photograph with a fence in the foreground and a boat on the lake behind it, if the bottom of the boat touches, from your perspective, the fence, it ends up looking like a toy boat sitting on a fence. These are the types of things we want to avoid in an illustration.</p>

<p>When composing an image, try to avoid things coming up and just barely touching. <strong>Either push an overlap or create space between the two</strong>. These are ways to solve awkward tangencies.</p>

<p>Even in an instance like a character throwing a punch and hitting another character, you don't want to have that moment where the knuckles are connecting with the face. It freezes the image and creates a static to the piece that freezes it in time. You want to catch that follow-through where the fist has passed the face and overlaps clearly, or the moment before where it's about to hit and you get that anticipation of the punch landing.</p>

<h3>Avoid the Corners</h3>

<p>One of the big problems with illustration is that we are composing into a rectangle or a square. The problem with that is that a square has four arrows that point out of the composition, that's your corners. <strong>Avoid those corners in general</strong>. Essentially, trim those corners off.</p>

<p>In an even better scenario, use graphic elements to <strong>picture corner</strong> your illustration, where you have some sort of element coming in that trims those corners off, like an old school photo album. Maybe a hand coming in from out of the illustration turns that corner and points back into the illustration.</p>

<p>Anything that can push the eye back towards the center is helpful. As you're laying out the graphic design of your piece, look for what energy those shapes have. Where are they moving just as graphic design shapes? Do they draw the eye towards the corners or around the image?</p>

<h3>Avoid Sameness</h3>

<p><strong>Composition is often the balance of unity and diversity</strong>. If things get too unified, meaning overly repetitive design within an image, it becomes very boring. It's like listening to a busy tone on a phone, it's the graphic equivalent of the busy signal.</p>

<p>Avoid repetition. For example, if you have two characters of the same size in the foreground, it's boring. <strong>Vary the scale</strong>, move the camera, push one into the foreground, and push one into the middle ground. Create differences of scale, shape, and value.</p>

<h2>Things to Do</h2>

<p>Now that we're starting to avoid these don'ts, let's talk about a few dos.</p>

<h3>Juxtapose Scale</h3>

<p>We already talked about juxtaposing scale. <strong>Move the camera behind one of the figures</strong> so that character is larger and comes up in the foreground. Our other character goes back into the middle ground.</p>

<p>Overlap them! You're eliminating tangencies by having them overlap. You're cutting off that picture corner by bringing that guy up into the front. You're getting rid of sameness by varying scale.</p>

<h3>Use Positive and Negative Shapes</h3>

<p>When laying out an image, you're going to have your three-value breakup: <strong>dark, middle, and light value</strong>. This can be broken up into foreground, middle ground, background.</p>

<p>What you want to do is <strong>vary those shapes up</strong>. It's a way of avoiding sameness. Arrange them to some degree of randomness. Don't have your middle axis with shapes the same distance on both sides.</p>

<p>For instance, use a <strong>steelyard composition</strong> where you're creating that balance of a smaller weight at the end of a fulcrum balancing out a larger weight nearer the fulcrum.</p>

<p>Think about <strong>positive and negative shapes</strong>. How are you surrounding or framing your elements? Are you placing them in the exact middle of the image with elements equally weighted on all sides? It's better to push it slightly to one side and down or up, balancing things out.</p>

<p>Break the image down to just three values, a dark value, a middle value, and a light value. Simplify and focus on design through the initial phases of your illustration. Then, as we take our drawing to more of a finish, we can start breaking down those three values into variations. Try to keep it to those three values at first.</p>

<h3>Create Movement</h3>

<p>Creating movement in your illustration can be a little more advanced. And I don't just mean big movement, it doesn't always mean throwing a big punch or flying through the sky. It can be small bits of <strong>indicated or implied movement</strong> that can create a passage of time within your illustration.</p>

<p>It can be a character's hair blowing, a cape subtly blowing in the wind, or smoke blowing across the ground. It creates the illusion of the passage of time. Even though it's a still image, you're implying time passing.</p>

<p>By having something moving, and movement only happens with time, you can add a fourth dimension to your artwork. The more you can imply that movement with little hints within an image, the more your image will become authentic and impactful to the viewer.</p>

<p>Sometimes I tell my students that being an artist is a little bit like being a supervillain and that you're leaving clues on purpose to the hero because it's the pursuit that you love. You're the villain, and the viewer is the hero, and you're leaving little clues for them to follow along and unravel your crime. The pursuit begins.</p>

<p>For example, the hair blowing in the same direction as the mist or the corner of a cape twirling up and creating movement. All of a sudden, it creates that passage of time where you're leaving little clues to the viewer that will lead them where you want them to go.</p>

<p>So, <strong>be that supervillain</strong>, leave those clues, create that motion, and good luck creating some compelling images.</p>
