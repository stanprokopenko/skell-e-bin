<p>I want to take you on a little journey through my giant stack of sketches. I've done <strong>thousands of life drawings</strong>, which allowed me to go from <strong>this</strong> to <strong>this</strong>, and from <strong>this</strong> to <strong>this</strong>.</p>

<p>This is the final sketchbook tour for our 12 Days of Proko. If you've been following along, you've seen a bunch of modern-day masters sharing their best sketches. That's really inspiring, and that's why we did it. But I get that for some, it might seem like these artists were always this good. Comparing your work to theirs can feel discouraging.</p>

<p>So, in this video, I'm doing the <strong>opposite</strong>. Instead of just showing my best work, I'll show you my <strong>early stuff</strong>, the rough work. I want you to see that becoming a good artist isn't about being born with talent. It's about <strong>practice and growth</strong>. I want to show you how much you can improve if you're dedicated.</p>

<p>As I flip through my old work, I'll occasionally put up a similar, more recent drawing to show you how much growth is possible.</p>

<h2>My First Days at Watts Atelier</h2>

<p>This is my very first session at <strong>Watts Atelier</strong>, the school I went to for 11 or 12 years. They told us to do some <strong>ovals</strong> and try out the new pencil. I had never drawn with a charcoal pencil sharpened in that way before.</p>

<p>This is a <strong>Conte pencil</strong> with about an inch or more of exposed charcoal, which is sharpened to a bullet shape. It allows you to use the side of the pencil, to put large areas of clean tone down. I'd never held a pencil overhand, I'd always held it like this. So, this was very new to me, a very little control when I first started.</p>

<h3>Learning the Basics</h3>

<p>We went on to some <strong>basic primitives</strong>. You can see a very poorly shaded sphere, but look, <strong>improvement</strong>! Still, I think this was the first day, and they had us practice a <strong>value scale</strong>. I had no idea how to separate my shadows and lights. You can see pure white in what is probably a shadow and dark right in here, which was probably some halftone. Just going in there and feeling it out.</p>

<p>Drawing every single tooth like a little tic-tac. I've been hesitating to do this video, just because most of this stack is going to be complete garbage. It's going to look really bad, and a lot of people have said in the past that, as an artist, you try to hide your bad stuff and present your good stuff, it kind of hurts your 'master persona,' right? But I consider myself an instructor, an art teacher, and I think this is very valuable for students to see.</p>

<p>All the exercises I did here can get you from <strong>this</strong> to <strong>this</strong>.</p>

<h2>Studying the Asaro Head</h2>

<p>We did a lot of <strong>Asaro heads</strong>. These were very normal warm-ups. You'd come into class, and one of these is just on there for you to draw while you wait for class to start. Sometimes, the <strong>Asaro head</strong> was the model we studied in class. It's really useful to understand the <strong>planes of the head</strong>. Not everybody has the exact same planes, but the same patterns exist. You apply a <strong>template</strong> to a specific person, and you can mold that template to form into that exact person you're drawing.</p>

<h2>Practicing Rhythms and Planes</h2>

<p>I think this was like day number three. We started from these printouts, and put some tracing paper over them. So, there's the <strong>rhythms</strong>, right? These rhythms indicate motion, little connections between the shapes. We're looking for movement across the muscles, and also the general planes of the head.</p>

<p>Doing this sort of thing helps you draw from reference and analyze an image. You're able to see relationships between all the shapes correctly. From the ear down to the chin is a really good indicator of where you have the side, and then it turns to the front. You don't see these lines on the photo, but they represent relationships between things in the photo.</p>

<p>I remember being so proud of this. I did this in two hours. I got clean separation of light and dark. I felt like this was the most three-dimensional drawing I'd ever done in my life. This was in my portfolio for a while. But yes, obviously looking back, I'm like, "Oh, so many mistakes," but I was very proud of it at the time. It was a win.</p>

<h2>Warming Up and Quick Sketches</h2>

<p>Another page of just warm-ups, circles and tone. Not much to this one, this is just warming up my hand for five minutes before class started.</p>

<p>Looks like we went on to probably 20-minute poses. At this time, I was just analyzing outlines, and I was putting symbols instead of analyzing the actual forms. I mean, I wasn't doing too bad. I think this does represent the model, I remember who the model was, and it kind of looks like him.</p>

<p>But I'm drawing like a little almond shape with a little circle inside it for the eyes, not actually looking at what's in front of me and what shapes I actually see. Like the lips, I just drew an outline around the lips and a little line in the middle. With lips, you don't usually see a full outline around everything. The bottom will just kind of create a shape of the shadow under the lip, you won't see an outline around the lip.</p>

<p>And then, like in here, there was probably a big shadow on the bottom part of the nose instead of all of these outlines. There's just a lot of stuff that I'm putting down because I feel like those are the important lines on the face and what I would see in a cartoon to represent a face.</p>

<h2>Starting Quick Sketch Figure Drawing</h2>

<p>Then we moved on to <strong>Quick Sketch</strong>. And by the way, this is all one class. In my first semester, I think I only took one class. I was going there on weekends, I think I was a junior in high school.</p>

<p>Every week, we're doing something different. Looks like we started <strong>Quick Sketch Figure Drawing</strong>. You can see I'm trying to capture the pose and a <strong>two-value separation</strong>, trying to separate shadow from light. Not doing a very good job of it, very kind of non-committed shapes of my shadows. I just kind of put a little bit of tone here and there, and I'm not really sure where the shadow ends.</p>

<p>Like, is this bottom leg also in shadow? I didn't really know what to do. I was afraid to group an entire leg shape into the background. It's like they're both in shadow, so if I'm doing a two-value drawing, just put them all in shadow, right? But I was afraid to separate it. It's like every body part needs to be visible.</p>

<p>Also, just the <strong>gesture</strong>, very stiff. All of the shapes of the body are just these little snowman-type things. We've got a curve on both sides. I knew nothing about gesture at this point, nothing. And so, this is just me copying the outlines of the muscles I'm seeing.</p>

<h2>Progressing with Quick Sketches</h2>

<p>Looks like the next day we did a long figure drawing. I spent some time really analyzing the shapes. Still, though, very non-committal in my shadow shapes. I'm not able to decide exactly where that edge of the shadow is and be able to control how that shadow transitions to light. I'm just putting a fuzzy dark shape everywhere and then outlines around the groups of muscles that I thought were important.</p>

<p>And they are, the <strong>deltoid</strong> is important. I probably saw maybe the teacher did something similar in their demo, so I was kind of copying it. But all of this is just purely observation, trying to get that perfect line, trying to copy it as I'm seeing it. And it looks like I did all right. I mean, the head is probably a little too small for this, this guy's probably going to be nine feet tall if he actually existed. Not too bad for my first figure drawing, it seems like.</p>

<p>By the way, if you're seeing some nice lines in here, that's not me. This looks like the instructor came in and drew over mine and put some really nice lines on top.</p>

<p>Then back to quick sketch for a bit, a bunch more stuff just like this. I'm just copying little snowman shapes everywhere. <strong>No gesture yet</strong>. Starting to go a little bit darker, I'm not too scared of the pencil anymore.</p>

<p>You're doing 30 of these in a day, and you're just getting the mileage. You're not getting any single amazing drawing, you're just getting practice and going through the motions of constructing the body from start to finish many, many times over and over again.</p>

<p>Initially, you can see I'm not finishing them. I don't have enough time because I just can't make decisions fast enough. But eventually, I'll be able to get a full figure down.</p>

<p>Looks like I'm starting to commit to some shadow shapes too. I mean, look at right here, I'm actually putting an edge. I mean, it's not a very good edge, it's a sharp edge all the way across, even though there's supposed to be some gradations in here. But I'm <strong>committing to a shape</strong>.</p>

<p>When you're putting shadow and light in a three- to five-minute drawing, you need to commit to shapes. Because if you can't commit to shapes, you can't <strong>design the shapes</strong>.</p>

<h3>Learning from Instructors</h3>

<p>Here's some really good examples. So, the top two, these are mine. You can see, again, even more commitment through here. You can see very clear separation, I'm deciding what this shape is.</p>

<p>And then these bottom two, this is the instructor. You can see how these are very simple, really simplified versions. Like, the arms are just little cylinders, like little hoses, little tubes. But the shapes are very specific. There's no detail of anatomy, but they're all specific decisions that they chose to do.</p>

<p>Whether it's right or wrong, they still committed to the shape, and I think that's what they were trying to get me to do here, just go in and <strong>commit to it</strong>. You know, your proportions will improve just with time. But if you never go for it and you don't trust yourself, then you're never going to make enough mistakes on purpose to then be able to analyze and say, "That's what I did wrong, I need to do this different thing instead."</p>

<p>If it's always just kind of wishy-washy, unsure stuff, how are you supposed to know if the shape you wanted to put down was going to look good or not?</p>

<h2>Continuing to Practice</h2>

<p>Okay, here's still first semester. I took their point, and I was like, okay, dark, light, and there's an edge, right? There's a shadow on this leg. Didn't have enough time to really define any edges clearly and then go in here and design some shapes. I just didn't have enough time because when there's four of them, that means they're five minutes each. If there's seven of them, that means they're three minutes each. If there's ten of them, that means they're two minutes each.</p>

<p>Oh man, it looks like maybe Jeff came in and did some. Look at that <strong>calligraphy</strong>, there are some anatomical details in there. Look at all that, little ribcage indications. Yeah, Jeff would come in and just do these, and I'd be like, "What?"] What did you just do? How do you do that with the pencil? Such subtle control to a really thin dark line, slightly thicker dark line, a really fuzzy middle-value line. Like, all of that subtlety actually indicates something about the form.</p>

<h2>Feeling Like I Took a Step Back</h2>

<p>Looks like I took a step back. Look at that. It's like I forgot how to separate my light and my dark. These are four- or five-minute poses. I'm trying to get the proportions, and I'm trying to separate my light and my dark and fill in the shadows, and I was just running out of time. I just did not know how to move this quickly yet. And so, it feels like nothing's working because I was trying to do too many things at the same time.</p>

<h2>Studying Anatomical Details</h2>

<p>Several Jeff Watts sketches in here. Look at that beautiful anatomy. Same thing in here. Jeff Watts, this one's Jeff, and these are all me.</p>

<p>The figure drawing, so this is mine. This was probably two and a half hours. I'm trying to find all of the little shapes, and I'm focused on all the subtle variations in the contour, and I'm following all that.</p>

<p>And I think this was Eric. He comes in and says, "Yo, just find the <strong>tubes</strong>. Like, look at just two lines. Stop thinking about all the subtleties and the bumps of the muscles. Just find the curve through here. It's all about the <strong>gesture</strong>, the relationships, the flow of the arm before the anatomy of the arm."</p>

<h2>Simplifying and Focusing on Gesture</h2>

<p>So here's one, and you can see I'm trying to shade. I've separated my lights and my darks, but it's like I'm just following this swirly shape that I don't know what it means. And the instructor came in and was like, "Yo, just think of this whole thing as a <strong>cylinder</strong> at first. The arm is a cylinder. Simplify that shadow shape."</p>

<p>By simplifying it, you are able to control the composition a lot better. You're able to connect the shapes and find the flow throughout the pose better. This is just, I'm trying to think of way too much information everywhere, and because of that, I just lose control of everything.</p>

<p>When you have a limited amount of time, you have two hours, and you're at the level that I was at, you just don't have time to think of all the anatomy that I was trying to think about. If you start with just cylinders, you can get started.</p>

<h2>Reflecting on Progress</h2>

<p>Here's another one that I felt was a real big win. The eyes, I don't think I was ever really proud of the eyes, but I was proud of the overall effect. I felt like I really controlled my values here, and I was able to show some form, and I <strong>simplified my composition</strong>. I was proud of this one.</p>

<p>Doing a lot of things like this. There's lots of models coming in. This page is just Jeff. Oh my gosh! I've got to separate this for sure. Look at that, this is all just Jeff. Beautiful quick sketches.</p>

<p>This was the goal, right? I come into class every day, I do some sketches, and I watch Jeff do this, and I'm like, "Oh, gotta do that!" And then it just inspires me to go home, practice, try to get control of the pencil as good as this.</p>

<p>It's a very difficult goal, and you're shooting for the moon when you're doing this. It seems so distant, seems impossible, but you know, at a young age, you kind of have that young confidence. It's like, "I can do anything."</p>

<p>I can totally see, just flipping through this, the progress is so subtle. It almost feels like there is no progress. When you look at each one, drawing one at a time, it feels like it's not getting better at all. Just the same thing over and over again.</p>

<h2>Reflecting on Talent vs. Skill</h2>

<p>Okay, so I'm going to step back from the life drawings for a minute here and flip through some of my very earliest sketchbooks, even way back before I started going to school. Really, I was like a kid when I did these sketchbooks.</p>

<p>And while I flip through it, I just want to talk to you about <strong>talent versus skill</strong>. Some people are born with certain advantages, but there are so many different skills involved in being an artist that having one innate ability doesn't guarantee success.</p>

<p>So chances are, you are born with some advantage. I know you might disagree, but hear me out. Maybe you're one of those savants who can remember all the details of a scene and replicate it perfectly, but probably not. Neither am I.</p>

<p>And if you're not, then maybe you're more creative, or you're more organized. Or perhaps you have better social skills, and that can help you write better stories. Or maybe you're good at pattern recognition, which helps you excel at composition.</p>

<p>Are you good at math? Well, that could help you to master <strong>perspective</strong>. Are you naturally good with technology? Well, you could use that to be a better digital artist. Are you athletic? That could be very useful if you're doing giant murals.</p>

<p>Do you have strong hands? Well, then you should try sculpting. And if you don't have any of these things but you're incredibly disciplined and hardworking, and you're extremely excited and motivated to do this, then you can <strong>brute force</strong> your way to acquire almost any of these skills.</p>

<p>Students who find it easy to do well in school can become lazy. Once they get out there, they need a good work ethic to thrive in the real world. And a healthy amount of struggle during the student years is good to develop those habits.</p>

<p>My point is that <strong>art is extremely diverse</strong> in what it can be and what is required to be an artist. Saying that you can't draw from memory as well as Kim Jung Gi did is not a reason why you can't do something else.</p>

<p>Sure, you can't be Kim Jung Gi, but why can't you be the <strong>best version of yourself</strong>? Find what you are good at. Find your <strong>unfair advantage</strong>.</p>

<h2>Returning to the Life Drawings</h2>

<p>Alright, let's get back to the life drawings. Maybe this is like semester number three. Hard to tell, but hey! Is that much better? But I do think I see some progress.</p>

<p>Hey, is this my first <strong>Skelly</strong> drawing? Bam! Oh my gosh. A lot of Skelly drawings, this must have been some anatomy class. And look at this tracing paper, that did not age well at all.</p>

<p>But it looks like I did a little Skelly, the instructor comes in and just simplifies it, makes it so much more elegant and clean. Another Skelly, this is mine, and the instructor is showing, "Hey, don't just think of the ribs, think of the <strong>whole rib cage</strong> and how there's a <strong>core shadow</strong> running along through here."</p>

<h2>Learning Cross-Contour Drawing</h2>

<p>Looks like this is my very first attempt at <strong>cross-contour drawing</strong>. It's very messy. I was like, "What are you? What is this? What are you talking about? Is this spirals?" And then trying to figure out plane changes through here.</p>

<p>Very messy, but I'm starting to get a little three-dimensional effect there, showing the plane changes. And I think this is Ron Lemon coming into my pad, doing a demo. I think these two are his. He's showing me and explaining some stuff to me. Look at this simplicity, showing the big plane changes, so three-dimensional while keeping the shape design just very simple in the anatomy.</p>

<h2>Studying Features and Expressions</h2>

<p>More feature studies. And I wouldn't just try to shade them, I would go look at the books and figure out what all of these pieces are. You've got bone, you've got cartilage and fat, and they all kind of interlock. This is important stuff to know, so that when you look at a nose, you understand what all those subtle halftone changes actually represent.</p>

<p>So lots of little studies like this for each feature.</p>

<p>As I flip through these, I feel like I was getting lazy or something. I think I might have been learning how to try to keep your lines loose, but in that, I was just getting these really ugly lines. Like, look at this, just a bunch of scribbles. This is no better than that first pad.</p>

<p>A little bit better than this one. Trying to put in some of those cross-contours, but making all the common mistakes here. You know, my lines here are not actually wrapping around the form, they're just little curves that represent that.</p>

<p>Yeah, we're looking down at it, but is it really showing the volume of the leg? Not really. It's just the same little C-curve over and over again, and the edges aren't wrapping back on either side.</p>

<p>But lots of improvement in just trying to simplify things to the <strong>motion</strong>, right? Big S-curve down here. So I'm trying to learn a lot of that simplicity and the <strong>gesture</strong>, and on the surface, it looks a little bit worse than when I was just focused on details. Because it's so simple everywhere, it doesn't feel like I know anything about the details.</p>

<p>But these were actually very useful to practice because when you do hundreds and hundreds of these, and then later you go back and you combine this with detail, then it starts to look good.</p>

<h2>Embracing the Learning Process</h2>

<p>You have to go through these phases where you're learning a new thing, and your drawings look worse because you're just doing that new thing. You're really just focused on doing that thing you're not good at.</p>

<p>So your drawings look bad, worse than before. And that's a really risky thing when we're studying. You have to be willing to always be on the edge of what you're comfortable with, always pushing yourself to keep improving, rather than just continuously doing the thing you're good at over and over again. Because then you'll never get good at all those other things that come together to make you a really good artist overall.</p>

<h2>The Value of Structured Learning</h2>

<p>That's one of the benefits of going to a kind of a structured <strong>atelier</strong> like that, you kind of don't have a choice. You come into class, and they're like, "Okay, now we're doing cross-contour." It's like, "Oh, I don't like cross-contour." Well, too bad, you're doing cross-contour.</p>

<p>And today we're doing shading, today we're doing anatomy of the nose, today we're doing quick sketch figures and quick sketch portraits, and you're just like all over the place, and you just have to adapt.</p>

<p>You get really good at adapting to all these different things. You never really get too comfortable with any one thing, but you're slowly improving in all of them, and then eventually it comes together, and you're just like, "Oh man, it's working."</p>

<h2>Memory Sketches and Feature Studies</h2>

<p>Little features and expressions study. Costume figure, yeah. Oh, interesting, <strong>memory sketch</strong>. So, this is where the model would take a pose, and then we would just look. We'd look for like 30 seconds or more like a minute, and we would just try to remember as much as we can.</p>

<p>Then the model sits down, and we draw it for three or four or five minutes, trying to do it from memory. This is really useful because you develop a longer-term visual memory so that when you look at something, you don't immediately forget it as you look at your drawing. You retain it for an extra 5–10 seconds.</p>

<p>Eventually, even days and years, you could just, you know, retain more of that visual stuff that you see. But it takes a lot of practice to really retain it for a very long time.</p>

<p>But even just, even if you're drawing from reference all the time, this is useful because you don't have to keep going up and down like this every two seconds. You could look, study something, and then look down and then draw that thing for 5 - 10 more seconds and look up. You just don't need to look as often, and you remember it more accurately as you execute it on the page.</p>

<p>But if you ever want to get to drawing from <strong>imagination</strong>, this is required.</p>

<h2>Combining Gesture and Detail</h2>

<p>I guess a little bit of improvement in some of these shapes. I'm capturing the gesture, but now I'm starting to think about the subtlety in the anatomy, and I'm starting to capture it just a little bit better.</p>

<p>I don't know if you guys are noticing, that's a little bit of improvement. Mushy hands, still not really showing much knowledge of anatomy in the halftones, just copying what I'm seeing.</p>

<p>You can tell by how I designed the collarbone here. Like, it's not actually tracking really well as that handlebar shape in here. I'm just kind of, "Oh, there's a little line right there?"] Okay, let's put a line right there. There's another one here, let's put another one here.</p>

<p>But not really thinking about how that's actually indicating a bone going from here to here, and what's the shape of the bone, and how do these halftones tell the story of the bone and the pec muscles softening the bottom of the bone, and how the neck connects to the top of it.</p>

<p>I wasn't thinking about any of that stuff, I was just analyzing shapes and halftone tiles and trying to put them down as accurately as I could. And then constantly, as I'm doing these, Jeff would come by and do something like this, and something like this, and just remind me of how big of a gap in knowledge and experience there is between what I'm doing and what he's doing.</p>

<p>You can just see how much subtlety there is in not just the knowledge of the anatomy in there, but just the subtlety in the <strong>line work</strong>, just the execution of the line. So much variety in there, if you really just zoom in and you study every line that he's putting down, you can see how much more control he has than like me in here.</p>

<h2>Focusing on Line Quality</h2>

<p>And then every once in a while, I try to get a little fancy with the <strong>edge work</strong>. Try to lose some edges in here and be like, "Oh, let's show some energy in the shading."</p>

<p>All it ends up being is just noise because none of it matters if you don't have really good <strong>structure</strong> and <strong>proportions</strong> and a good handle on light and dark separation and how all of these light and dark shapes really need to just show the form and the light on the form.</p>

<p>And when you don't have everything coming together in that good story, it just kind of looks like noise. And so, you know, this is me trying to get fancy and try to feel it out, which is good, you need to do that stuff, but it also just shows there's not enough experience in constructing the 3D forms yet.</p>

<p>Looks like a caricature study. This is, I believe, a Kruger painting. Look up Kruger caricature, some of the most amazing caricature paintings I've ever seen. But not bad. I mean, analyzing the forms, the 3D forms of this, just linearly, is starting to show some three-dimensional stuff in here. This is pretty good.</p>

<h2>Deliberate Practice of Line Work</h2>

<p>Now we come to the part where I'm seeing a lot of quick sketches where I'm trying to copy a lot of Jeff's dexterity, a lot of his <strong>calligraphy</strong>, all the variety in the line work.</p>

<p>So you can see I'm paying attention to thick to thin, dark to light, really, really subtle indications of like fingers and stuff. Trying to control it, you can see it's much more messy than his, but there is definitely improvement in that instead of just using kind of the side of my pencil to draw lines as they come out of my shoulder.</p>

<p>I'm starting to be very deliberate with like, "Okay, I'm gonna put thin to thick here, and maybe a really dark and thick here, and then maybe like light rhythm lines across here," making decisions.</p>

<p>Again, this is just like with the shapes early on where I'm trying to deliberately design light and dark shapes. Now, I'm at the stage where I'm very deliberately trying to design the <strong>calligraphy</strong> in my lines.</p>

<p>And if you don't go through that stage where you're being very deliberate with every decision about a specific thing, you kind of just stay stuck in this mediocre stage.</p>

<p>Very lucky that I had someone to look at to shoot for, like with the stuff that Jeff would do, where, I mean, he's just such a wide variety of lines to be able to copy. If you don't have that available to you, if you don't see that on a daily basis, you just forget that it's even possible. You just think, "Oh, lines are lines, who cares?" The <strong>beauty of the line</strong> can in itself just be the art.</p>

<p>So, very important, anything you want to improve on, you spend weeks, months just being very deliberate with the decisions about that thing that you're trying to improve.</p>

<h2>Continuing to Improve</h2>

<p>The first semester, I think I took one class, right? So once a week, for three hours on Saturdays. Then, I think after that, I went to three classes per week. So I probably did Saturday morning, Saturday afternoon, so three hours, three hours, and then probably, I think I did like a Wednesday night or something, right?</p>

<p>So after school, still in high school, I would go and do three hours. I think it was 7 to 10 pm. I would stay to that schedule, about three or four classes per week. I did that for five years before I started teaching. And then when I started teaching, then I taught four classes a week plus maybe took one a week, and then I was doing a lot more at home.</p>

<p>But I'm gonna start skipping more and more through here because this could go on forever. But I feel like my line work definitely is getting more confident right around here.</p>

<h2>Putting It All Together</h2>

<p>Proportions are getting more and more consistent. I'm not seeing any major flaws in just, you know, things being too big or too small. It's just about figuring out how to design everything to look really cool.</p>

<p>Right now, I'm still in that beginner-intermediate phase where it's like, it looks okay but it's not any better than 95% of people in life drawing class.</p>

<p>But yeah, definitely committing quite a bit, really thinking about compositionally each one, what's going on, making bolder decisions on how to group my shapes together.</p>

<p>Ooh, there's a big leap forward. Some good shading in here. Starting to even use like a little bit of line work in the plane indication there, a little bit in the nose. But generally, in these longer studies, I would try to keep it clean, try to be as accurate as I could.</p>

<p>Here's another good one right afterwards. This was a drapery study, so pretty good in the design of a lot of these folds. And I remember being really happy with how I indicated that face. It's a really small indication, I mean, that's like maybe an inch and a half, and I was able to control my shapes to kind of come together to what I thought was a pretty good expression.</p>

<h2>Reflecting on the Journey</h2>

<p>Oh my gosh, I think I found the first attempt at a signature on one of these. Look at that!</p>

<p>Oh yeah, this one, I remember this. I was really proud in here. The arm, the knees, I was very happy with it. Not happy with that foot, for sure, and also not happy with the face, she just looked really sad. Messy hair, but I was very happy with a lot of the stuff in here.</p>

<p>Here's a difficult lighting setup. It's like we have light coming from the bottom, and this just messes you up. It's like you're so used to drawing the same planes in dark that when you reverse it, it's like you're starting from scratch. Nothing is familiar anymore.</p>

<p>I was so used to drawing that bottom of the nose in shadow, right? And you've got a cast shadow coming off of it towards the lips, and now it's the opposite. Now, this is in light, and you've got like a shadow going upward. And then all the bottom plane of the lip is in light.</p>

<p>It was weird. I had to analyze things more deeply. I had to really pay attention in order to really capture the light. So I remember this being a struggle, but it turned out alright.</p>

<h2>Continuing to Grow</h2>

<p>After skipping a bunch of stuff, I think I'm starting to see a little bit of improvement in some of these. It's just a little bit, but not really.</p>

<p>Ooh, another one I remember putting in my portfolio. I just thought the composition was cool. It's a strong composition, but the shading is still... nah. It doesn't show any knowledge of this hip, you know, what's going on in here? There's no oblique, there's really no iliac crest, there's no information there at all. It just shows that I'm still surface level, copying the model instead of interpreting.</p>

<p>There's very little understanding of what's going on underneath. But I am getting better at shading, you know, a little. The gradation across here is pretty good at showing that soft form. Compositionally, it wasn't too bad. But like, look at this hand, gah! Oh my gosh! I think zero improvement in hands since that first page. Just, I mean, what is that? What am I even doing there?</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p>As I look back at all these drawings, I can see the gradual improvement over time. It wasn't overnight, it was the result of <strong>thousands of drawings</strong>, countless hours of practice, and learning from mistakes.</p>

<p>If there's one thing I want you to take away from this, it's that <strong>dedication and deliberate practice</strong> are key to becoming a better artist. Embrace the journey, embrace the struggles, and keep pushing yourself to learn and grow.</p>
