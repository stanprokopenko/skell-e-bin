<p><strong>Where we're at at the moment.</strong></p>

<p>We've done our <strong>sketch</strong>, established our <strong>values</strong>, and started to <strong>block in some colors</strong>. Now, we've begun to play around with the <strong>lighting</strong> to really show more of the form. The next step is <strong>refinement</strong>, still keeping an eye on our values, making sure every decision we're making is logical and in context with all the other shapes around it.</p>

<p>We don't want to just start throwing <strong>specular highlights</strong> willy-nilly because they look cool at the moment. We want to really think about <strong>where the light source is</strong>. Why would we be putting certain values, certain lights, certain colors in certain places?</p>

<h2>Adjusting the Background</h2>

<p>I'm going to <strong>spice up the background</strong> a little bit to make it more visually interesting. On the background layer, I go to <strong>hue/saturation options</strong> (Command or Control U). These are still pretty dark, but if we crank up the <strong>brightness</strong> and adjust the <strong>hue</strong>, we can get more of a school bus yellow. That's inspired by the cool mustardy yellow color of school buses here.</p>

<p>So let's go with something similar to that. It could work and make the image <strong>pop</strong> a little bit. Because we've got our values in place, I can start to play around with some of these more <strong>out-there color notes</strong>.</p>

<h2>Adding Color Variation</h2>

<p>Let's get back to the <strong>Filthy</strong> plugin, and I can just start to play. We might start whipping in some of these colors, maybe not that bright. I want to keep the <strong>saturation high</strong>, and in the <strong>darkest darks</strong> is where I like to sometimes add some of these little <strong>color notes</strong>, which are similar to the background. We can <strong>knock them back</strong> as well if they're too in your face.</p>

<p>Even in here, we can start to add some <strong>color variation</strong>. Now, with the Filthy plugin, you can try <strong>hue shifts</strong>, so each shape you create has a little different hue. We're not going to be that intense with it. What you can also do is use the <strong>Luminance Lock</strong> feature. You can choose the value that you want and then start to add in a little bit of color variation, but it keeps the same value. It does a tricky thing in the background to keep everything within the same or similar background value that you've selected.</p>

<p>Then you can do these little color variations a little bit easier without having to pull your hair out trying to make sure all your values are bang on once you've already got them there. You can turn on the <strong>Luminance Lock</strong>, and now I'm just whipping crazy colors in here. We might knock that back a little bit. Even in here, we can just start adding some more color variations.</p>

<p>If we <strong>zoom out</strong>, it doesn't look too out of place. We can knock it back a tad, but this gives us freedom to just start adding some raw <strong>pops of color</strong>. Utilize some of that orange here.</p>

<h2>Cleaning Up the Artwork</h2>

<p>At this stage, we can take our time to <strong>fix up any of these little places</strong> that we've missed. For example, I might think there could be an opportunity for a nice <strong>drop shadow</strong>, but it is way too much right now, so we're going to knock that right back with our eraser tool. Then we can even delete a section of it here. Now we've got that shadow of the hair.</p>

<p>I'm going to come in and really nail in some of these <strong>value transitions</strong>. Even here, this is a bit messy as well. I'm trying to find places where things are looking messy. So here on this neck, I might clean that up completely. That gives us a nice clean outline, at the very least, to play around with.</p>

<p>I might then <strong>merge everything down</strong>, be a little bit crazy, Command J to duplicate, merge it all down, and then let's continue to <strong>clean up</strong> some of these lines. Now, it depends how clean you want to go with this as well. You don't have to clean this up a crazy amount, just that little bit of a cleaner look to some of these shapes also helps as we are refining these shapes and slowly refining the values, just to have a little bit less <strong>visual noise</strong>, I guess you could say.</p>

<p>Here, I'm going to have some hair crossing over the top, so I might just imagine that that doesn't exist anymore, that little hair shadow. And we might do that. This is where we could use the <strong>smudge tool</strong>, just to quickly get our blank canvas of where we're thinking of doing stuff.</p>

<h2>Refining Lighting and Values</h2>

<p>We can experiment with another <strong>rim light</strong> on the other side to offset that really harsh rim light here. I might come through and do a softer, more <strong>orange or warmer light</strong> on this side just to tie it into the background a little bit more. We've got something similar here, still trying to keep in mind this idea of <strong>fall-off with the values</strong>.</p>

<p>I think we could even do just a stroke of light to balance that out on either side. Then we can go to the top, use our <strong>lasso tool</strong>, get some of the hair, and find a shape that makes sense, maybe something like that and a couple little ones. It gives it a little bit more dynamics. Then we can come through and add in a bit of the <strong>shadow</strong> that would be there as well.</p>

<p>It's going to be quite harsh, but we can always <strong>knock that back</strong> a little bit as well. So it grounds it a little bit more in reality. And it's on a separate layer, so we can adjust as we need.</p>

<h3>Adding Highlights and Details</h3>

<p>I think the hair needs a little bit of a <strong>sheen</strong>, so we can do that again with the lasso tool if we want to be a little bit quicker with it. I mean, we could leave it like that, or we could undo it and get our simple airbrush, and just a light pass with it. Then we can do that, and then maybe here is going to have a different, knock that back a little bit, more kind of shine to it.</p>

<p>At this stage, it's really just going back and forth and seeing what works. I think that needs to be more enlightened, even a bit of that brow, as she's furrowing her brow a little bit. You add that. When it comes to <strong>detail</strong>, I don't go overboard with it because no one's really going to be <strong>zooming in this far</strong> in reality. So it's probably a good idea to be <strong>zoomed out a little bit</strong>, if I'm honest. I think it's worth taking a step back and just looking at it as a whole, what needs to be done.</p>

<h2>Checking Values in Grayscale</h2>

<p>A good little tip is to go <strong>black and white</strong> as a layer mode. You can convert the image to black and white and just look at the values, back to where we were kind of in the beginning, and just give us a look at where we're at.</p>

<p>We can do something with the background potentially where there's kind of a gradient if we want to make it pop even more. This is feeling pretty okay from a values perspective. And then all it is now is going through and just refining and refining.</p>

<p>Here I can see underneath the chin compared to her chin, I need to brighten that up just a tad. I could even come through with a bit of light on the eye if I wanted to, as well. A few of these flyaway hairs might be catching some of that rim light as well. Even adding some flyaway hair here could be helpful.</p>

<p>Going back and forth with the black and white does help quite a lot. So now, in saying that, let's come through with that little bit of extra light where it needs to be. And I'll <strong>rotate the canvas</strong> as well to get a different angle or the angle that feels more comfortable to me. I don't need to stay at the exact same angle all the time.</p>

<p>Just so slightly increase the brightness underneath there. See how that feels, it might be a little bit too harsh. We can knock that back, and we can even add in just a thin line. See, this is the thing, we can <strong>stylize the light</strong> as well. It doesn't have to be ultra-realistic. You can stylize the shapes, and then you can stylize the light. Maybe there's not going to typically be that much glow underneath a chin, but again, we can do whatever we want.</p>

<p>We can come and grab the <strong>Color Dodge</strong>, add in way more of that glow, and that's going a lot. We can do a lot underneath here, and then really knock it back. We can still keep a little bit of it. That's without, that's with, just add just that little bit of <strong>bloom</strong>, I guess you could say.</p>

<p>I would also like to add a little bit of a color dodge right here just to warm up, select color, then invert. It's like pink hue, yeah, I like it. That's great.</p>

<p>Here, I'll clean up, we've got some of the sketchiness in the ear, so I just want to come through and <strong>clean some of this up</strong>. Just make it clear, make these shapes clearer. Even though it's more of a sketchy kind of piece, I still want to clear up sections of it.</p>

<h2>Final Adjustments</h2>

<p>Now I'm cleaning up some of these outside lines. I'm really increasing the flow and the opacity, just kind of trying to tie everything together. There are a few things in the back of the head, but I'm okay with leaving that less done or finished because this is kind of the focal area. The back is still looking a little raw, it's raw, a little bit unfinished, but that may just be a <strong>style choice</strong>. I'm going for the old excuse of "it's my style.</p>

<p>I think I could even <strong>cut in the neck</strong> a little bit here because this is looking a little bit thick to my liking. So cutting that in there, and then I'm going to go and fix the hair a little bit. Yeah, feels a little bit better. And then what I've just realized is we've got all this overlap that I want to maybe get rid of.</p>

<p>Let's see if we can maybe give the illusion of a little <strong>eye shadow</strong> like that and really set the eye in the socket a little bit more, darkening this part up hopefully separates these two. So there's like, this is darkest dark, this is lightest, and that kind of middle, so it kind of separates them a little bit, I hope.</p>

<p>Then we can just come through. I would honestly, if I was by myself, I would just keep working on this for <strong>hours and hours and hours</strong>. There are all these little subtle variations you can make in here, like making sure that this nose comes down. But look, we're not trying to be perfect here. I'm trying to get the idea across of a character.</p>

<h3>Experimenting with Background and Colors</h3>

<p>Maybe we could even tweak the background a little bit, just to make it <strong>pop</strong> even more. So could we, let's just get the, I'm not going to mess around with the gradients or a big airbrush, really high saturation, multiply layer. All right, and then darken that down, increase the saturation. What can we get away with?</p>

<p>This is the thing, you just go back and forth forever. Like, "Oh, maybe, maybe not." Maybe more of this, that kind of deal. Because we've got the orange background, you can only go so dark with the saturated reds and oranges before it starts to look a bit browny. I don't think we want that kind of look.</p>

<p>If we wanted to darken this up, say we wanted to really, yeah, if we want to really make it dark, it's like a whole bunch of value in there. I mean, that punches it up. We can even erase it, and we can come back with it. And then if we come here, darken it down, it does give it kind of a, I mean, these are kind of <strong>Halloween-y colors</strong>, right? But it could be a little bit of that.</p>

<p>If we look at this, this works from a black and white perspective. If we were to stretch that down across the face, it gives it that nice gradient, sort of makes it pop a little bit more. But I'm not sure that I like the lack of saturation in that, so it's a balancing game, you know?</p>

<p>So we can just come, pass, pop up the saturation, bring back the lightness, and I think that could work. And then you know what? Let's group those, merge those, and then try different variations. Maybe that feels better, or the purples feel better, you know what I mean? The blues feel better. Either or, you can do all sorts of stuff. That's the thing with color, you can do so much.</p>

<p>**Lots of options. ** This kind of fits a little bit more, for some reason, it fits potentially the attitude, the mood. Yeah, I think the red is a little bit garish, and potentially is a little bit in your face. And we've got a little bit of the hints of the purple here as well in the hair, so I think that could be contributing to it feeling nice.</p>

<h3>Final Touches</h3>

<p>I'm just going to finish up with some <strong>refinement of the shapes</strong>. I love to sometimes just do the <strong>textural stuff</strong> just with the blocks of color as well. It doesn't really fit here because I've gone quite smooth with it, but sometimes it's nice just to go <strong>stair-step values</strong> without any blending, without anything, it's just the values that are going to turn the form.</p>

<p>Because this part here is going to catch more light, which I was not showing before. Could even, if that's similar, could even catch a little bit of a specular. Then you've got to contend with this drop shadow potentially. It's a back and forth. You'll find stuff as you go along, it's like, "Oh yeah, this needs to be lighter, this needs to be darker." This doesn't make sense, the way that I put this shadow here. So don't be afraid to make the adjustments whenever you need it.</p>

<p>I'm seeing new things all the time. Like right now, I'm seeing all new stuff that needs some attention. Issues up like that, moving the back down here. Because sometimes, at this point, I would honestly take a break, and a good little tip as well is to <strong>export it to your phone</strong> and look at it at a smaller size. You'll be surprised how much you can actually see and observe at a much smaller size. It's like, "Okay, this all looks like one flat value, so let's increase that just a bit."</p>

<p>Let's see how we can blend that in. And this is the detriment to <strong>zooming in so far</strong> that I didn't see this, and I could have fixed this sort of neck area much sooner. I think this is a lot more, it's sketchy, it's a lot looser, but it fits a lot better. There's a clear gradient of the values, which makes more sense. So yeah, <strong>zooming out</strong>, staying zoomed out for a little while is a good little tip that I should have done earlier.</p>

<p>That's alright. And then just add some random little marks because I feel like it.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p>Okay, cool. So I spent a little bit more time on this, just a few tweaks here and there. I didn't want to bore you with all the little details, but <strong>here she is</strong>. I hope you like her. I hope you <strong>learned a little bit</strong>.</p>

<p>It's not a quick process. Sometimes I don't want to spend all my time doing the values first and then adding the color over the top. Sometimes I just want to go <strong>straight to color</strong>, which you definitely can do. This is just <strong>one way</strong>. So give it a shot, and you might like it. If not, take bits and pieces that you've learned that might be useful to you and run with them.</p>
