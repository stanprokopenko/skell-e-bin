<p>Hi everyone,</p>

<p>I'm here to respond to your uploads from the recent assignments, mostly about <strong>eye level</strong>. There was only one assignment, but that didn't stop you. Quite a few of you took on the <strong>hardest challenges</strong> so far, <strong>the twisting arrow</strong>, <strong>the curving arrow</strong>, <strong>the floating anvil</strong>, and more. We'll look at them later.</p>

<h2>Eye Level Skill Building Project</h2>

<p>Let me remind you, this was about <strong>skill building</strong>. We'll begin with the first drawn submission by <strong>Vera Robson</strong>, which is her first attempt at changing one-point perspective very slightly.</p>

<p>Here we have a view of a booth. I'm not sure where it's from, it looks like it could be from <em>2001: A Space Odyssey</em>. Vera moved the view just a little to the right, and let's look at the lessons we can learn.</p>

<p>The first thing we notice is how the booth walls shift. In the original, they are equally spaced because the view is centered. When we move the view to the right, so that our eye sees one wall as a sliver and the other opens up more, things change.</p>

<p>Look at how the two objects on the right, when we are over here, have more distance between each other on the flat surface. When we move to the right, one appears to move closer to the other. Also, notice how the floor on the right shows more floor when we move over toward it.</p>

<p>That's not an eye level thing, but it's a shift of perspective left and right, as you saw in the swivel-the-page exercise. It's the same phenomenon, and we also saw that in the cathedral episode. You can see slightly up or down as you move the eye level. You could swivel those cathedrals left and right, and they would exhibit the same effects.</p>

<p>One thing I question, Vera, is the openness of this window at the right. It seems to be getting more open, but I'm not sure. I would not correct it, and here's why. These exercises were meant to make big decisions, and you did that superbly with time limits. To get it exact would displace your energy.</p>

<p>Some people who love closure would do it, but here's the argument not to, it can short-circuit the bigger challenge here, which is to notice these <strong>big differences</strong> over and over into habit. This was about anything but closure, it was about <strong>process</strong>, as Lynn pointed out a few posts later, experimenting with severe timers without dwelling to fix errors. And you did it superbly. Thanks, Vera.</p>

<p>Actually, if there was anything that I was going to offer you, it would be to do what I just did so easily, to notice it and resist the temptation to finish it. You obviously can, and you will when it's worth doing.</p>

<h3>Feedback on Nasim's Submission</h3>

<p>With that in mind, <strong>Nasim</strong>, the timer was a little bit stressful, quick and dirty, but really fun. You struggled the most with keeping proportions correct. We'll do more now.</p>

<p>Well, Nasim, how could we ask for better? <strong>A+++</strong>. This shows that your brain is engaged and succeeding at this very project. I have nothing to critique. You did it, Nasim.</p>

<h3>Feedback on Josh Drummond's Submission</h3>

<p><strong>Josh Drummond</strong> asked, "Is there a reason that looking up is less intuitive than other angles?" You would think it would be the other way around, we were all kids first, looking up at things, so we know the world that way, and most of us have never been giants before.</p>

<p>Yes, I have found that too. It may be that we do tend to look down a lot to survive. But Josh, you did not shy away. "I did a couple rooms and tried to experiment with some basic skull constructions. It helps to draw through indeed, but I need to slow down as well."</p>

<p>Ah, you don't need to slow down for this.</p>

<h2>Addressing Perspective Challenges</h2>

<p>We've looked at the first three uploads, which are <strong>so on the money</strong> for how to do this that those of you who follow have plenty of inspiration just in these first three. Thank you, Josh Drummond.</p>

<h3>Feedback on Randy Pon</h3>

<p><strong>Randy Pon</strong> wrote, "I know that since I put the vanishing points within the boxed borders, the perspective would get super distorted when there's two vanishing points in the same picture. Applying the same logic as the higher angles just winds up putting the viewer under the room in space instead of giving them the view an ant would. Is it the small workspace? Is my logic flawed? What am I doing wrong here?"</p>

<p>Well, I see your "oops" and "oops again" and then one that says "okay," and I'm lost. I'm not sure what you're trying to do here, but here's what I think is happening.</p>

<p>Let's be clear that as soon as you tilted down, you created <strong>two-point perspective</strong> with two vanishing points in the same picture. You did not need to bring in that lower point, which may have confused you.</p>

<p>You lift the view by lifting here, you didn't lift the horizon that much. If you lift that horizon up out of the picture, then you can justify bringing in that lower vertical into the picture. But by that time, you're going to have to have the horizon way out of here.</p>

<p>Let's see if I can make this more clear. There is your one point on the horizon, simple enough. There is your two-point, one on the horizon, one below, and they are too close.</p>

<p>Look at your next one, same issue. Herein is the problem. Maybe it will help to see what happens if we swivel, because vanishing points that close together within a frame complicate the picture.</p>

<p>Let's go back to one point. We can just lift the horizon, and we don't need a vanishing point below if we really lift over this scene. We do need two vanishing points now, but look at how the depth point on the horizon is way out of the picture, and for that matter, so is the height point below.</p>

<p>That's what I think happened, Randy. Compare, you got confused about the relationship between the two points, and you didn't even need that second point for this view. I hope that helps.</p>

<h3>Advice on Dealing with Vertical Vanishing Points</h3>

<p>I knew a young man who could speak perfectly normal, didn't stutter, didn't stammer, until he'd get into the presence of a girl, and then he couldn't get words out without blundering. I think he was just so fascinated with femininity, it made him temporarily crazy.</p>

<p>I think you've got a thing going like that with <strong>vertical vanishing points</strong> for the time being. Just leave them out. Bring the horizon down, bring the horizon up, and then later you can deal with those vertical vanishing points and keep your head.</p>

<h2>The Importance of Horizons and Eye Level</h2>

<p><strong>Finn</strong>, I did suggest in a video that you swivel the page to see how up and down are like left and right, but that was to benefit your brain in a presentation. Swivel views are hard on the viewer, worse than Dutch tilts in film. At least with Dutch tilts, when the camera tilts one way, the next shot is usually tilting the other way.</p>

<p>So if you're going to give us the swivel at 90 degrees, you might give us the next one swiveled at 90 degrees the other direction. But that's your responsibility.</p>

<p>I think what you did was valuable, but for us, it's rough. Good work.</p>

<p>Notice everyone how in most of these, we feel <strong>close up</strong> to the scene, and that's coming soon as a formal lesson. But another little hint, when the close parts spread out into bigness, good chance that it's because they are getting <strong>touch-distance close</strong>.</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>

<h3>Feedback on Cita's Submission</h3>

<p><strong>Cita</strong> wrote Great. I will be moving to sketch, and then angles change from there. To be honest, it's the first time I look at the rest and feel defeated. Seven years in, and it still looks bad. Oh well, seven more years ahead, I hope.</p>

<p>Well good if you can take that attitude, but that feeling defeated because these are hard is something that it's best not to indulge too much.</p>

<p>I did a video for Proko some years ago where I was drawing horses without preliminary pencils, just straight ink, and I just wasn't happy with them, and I apologized for it, including on camera. And one of the wise producers here told me, "You don't need to beat yourself up."</p>

<p>So I understand the feeling, and I have an image of beating myself up, which I don't like.</p>

<p>I think it's important to acknowledge that they aren't what you wish they would be, but in this group we can be pretty sure that we are, to someone else in the group, like an older sibling who can do it better than the younger sibling, not so well that it discourages the younger one, just better enough to where the younger sibling can say, "I could do that, and I think I can do it even better."</p>

<p>So if we aren't doing our best work and we're in a group, at least we have an evolutionary function.</p>

<p>And Cita, these are fine for what we're doing, which is to present them and get feedback.</p>

<h3>Using Horizon Lines and Vanishing Points</h3>

<p>Now for feedback, look at how this line at the top of this door goes away from us and down to a vanishing point on a horizon line between here and here. I think if these lines are level, they should be horizontal unless they're going away to a vanishing point. And if they are, they'd be going away to a vanishing point way far away.</p>

<p>But it would also mean that this one, which is parallel to them, would be going to the same vanishing point way far away. And this is why it helps to <strong>draw the horizon line</strong> in there.</p>

<p>You've got that same problem happening in some of these other ones too. That's what's going wrong. You're aiming up and down, good. If it's above me, it goes down. If it's below me, it goes up. But you're not getting the <strong>acute and obtuse angles</strong> that would happen, that change as they get closer to and distant from the horizon line.</p>

<p>How can you do that if you don't include the horizon line? Look at <strong>Joi</strong> putting in a big red line, a horizon line, to be sure of it. And if you'll actually pull those lines out from a point on the horizon or aim them to a horizon, and granted they are going away, you will save yourself a lot of that trouble and inclination to beat yourself up.</p>

<p>Cita, you also mentioned, "I tried to go to different angles from top left, but as I tried, I could not get the scale to remain the same no matter how I tried. The viewpoint seemed to zoom in more than I wanted. After struggling, I just drew what I could and reached here for help. When you reimagine a scene, how can you keep the scale similar?"</p>

<p>You can't if you don't have reference that establishes <strong>unforeshortened or extremely foreshortened proportion</strong>, which is orthos. So, first things first.</p>

<p>But the short answer is you keep the scale similar at this point in your training by <strong>trying</strong>, the way you learned to pick up a glass of water as a child without spilling. You tried it until you could.</p>

<p>If that's not working for you, as I've mentioned before, we will shift gears ahead, and you will <strong>measure and measure and measure</strong> quantifiably, and it will be significantly slower. And you'll need to be in a state not of just measuring, but noticing what happens when you do measure.</p>

<p>We've already done some of that with the anvil and the other things, and you've been trying to get the proportions correct. That is a way to feed your sensibilities to come back to do what you're doing here for the rest of your life, maybe by eye now.</p>

<p>Cita, go on to the next posts by <strong>Dave Sakamoto</strong>, and you see remarkable examples. It could be higher contrast.</p>

<p><strong>Dave</strong> and <strong>Vange</strong>, if it helps to work from the work of your fellow students, keeping in mind what I said here, try that.</p>

<p>Ammo, interiors and exteriors, exteriors with interiors built into their exteriors. A lot of exteriors, but you did the job very good. Long-term benefits for you.</p>

<h2>Overcoming Perfectionism</h2>

<p><strong>Rupert DDD</strong>, "I think 50 may kill me." Yeah, 50 will kill you if you're going to do them at this level, but you did not do these with a timer on and limited to five minutes or three minutes or two minutes or one. They're so impressive, and you are doing <strong>finished pieces</strong>, so thank you for showing us where it can go.</p>

<h3>Feedback on Liesel's Submission</h3>

<p><strong>Liesel</strong> writes Seriously inspiring! I only managed one, got too caught up trying to make things perfect instead of just practicing more loosely. If anyone has advice on how to let go of that and build a more consistent practice, I'd really appreciate it.</p>

<p>Just do it. This is a two-story library inspired by the reference photo attached. It's a mix of freehand and ruler work. It took me a lot longer than I expected, especially drawing through everything, including the ladder. Excuse the mess, I might go back and clean up the lines later.</p>

<p>I wasn't sure if the balcony and railing make structural sense. Does it seem believable? Also, I really struggled with relative proportion, for example, where would you say the couch hits on the ladder behind it? Around the second rung? I just placed things by intuition, but is that what we're supposed to do when objects are at different distances, or is there a better method? Any feedback is welcome, and thanks in advance.</p>

<p>Well, let's see the model you worked from. We've got this couch, and we've now placed it over here. We've got the ladder, so nice to see the inside of a beautiful library.</p>

<p>And you're asking where would the height of this couch land on the ladder. I think that instead of doing a demo here in the studio, I'm going to do a separate bit that we'll insert, where I will show you the options of how to find that, and then we'll come back here.</p>

<h3>The Challenge of Measuring Proportions</h3>

<p>We are trying to find where the highest point of the couch lands on this leaning ladder. It could be easy if the couch is lined up conveniently, and the base may be just right in this case, but it's hard to see over there through all those lines.</p>

<p>And here is a second issue, the high part of the couch is not directly over that line. So we've gotta be careful to get this right, even if it means tracking a lot of lines.</p>

<p>Let's work up here where it's easier to see. We're trying to get the height of the couch over to here and run it back to the ladder, but getting the height of the couch over here can go wrong, and it did.</p>

<p>Let's see what's going on. If we find a lowest point on the floor and bring it to the baseline of the ladder, then run the highest point of the couch over there, it won't work because we need a height point directly above the base point. We would have the same problem if we started with the height, where is the point on the floor directly below it?</p>

<p>To get these points, we must take <strong>rides on the three line systems</strong> to find unknown points with connections from known points.</p>

<p>Let's try again to move that high point there, so that it's directly above this corner touching the floor. We must find a way to bring it by way of lines, or in some cases, complete sections, so we know exactly where to stop, up to the same proximal position. Then we can work confidently with reliable height, run it across, run it back to the base of the ladder, and across to the leaning edge.</p>

<p>And gosh, that was hard, so many lines just to find the height of the couch on the ladder. But we found it.</p>

<p>Could we have made it simpler? Yes, if the couch was simpler and didn't lift off the floor, or if we had the <strong>orthos</strong> so we could be sure of the couch parts' proportions to each other. It would take far fewer moves.</p>

<p>But I took the long way to show you that sometimes it takes that, and the long way around can get you thinking through the problem, seeking a simpler way until it comes easy.</p>

<p>One last comment, there are multiple ways to measure back, and measuring can get so baffling you may feel threatened. But in part two of this course, we will deal with it in a time-honored way by understanding just enough of this technical stuff to get so familiar with the basics of form and space, you will be able to <em>see it out</em> onto the page.</p>

<p>Now, in preparation for that, <strong>Andrew Loomis's pages on height and eye level</strong> are quite useful. If you study them until you understand it, it will strengthen your ability to work it out in your own pictures. And if you don't fully understand it, you'll be stretching toward understanding how height measurements change according to the laws of <strong>diminution and convergence together</strong>.</p>

<p>Back to the critique, please.</p>

<p>I hope that helped.</p>

<p>Intuition has been the way we've done it in order to prime your intuition, but now we are dealing in that demo with a <strong>quantifiable way of measuring</strong>. And to you, that demo means more than it may to other mortals because you used your intuition.</p>

<h2>The Value of Working Freehand</h2>

<p>Now to address this straight edge and tools business. <strong>Carlos</strong> says, "Next time I'll just sketch the outlines freehand instead of using the tools. It will be quicker." It will, and it's better to do these <strong>freehand</strong> rather than use the tools.</p>

<p><strong>Pamela D</strong> is a case in point, look at the style. If this were a song, it would sound like a real person singing, just enough texture in the voice to let us know that this is not autotune. Part of style comes out of what we do without tools, that tweak and make everything more machine-like.</p>

<p>And of course, on style we would challenge what I just said, and question it from all angles to see what works for you best. Some people are electronic music makers, and some are folk guitarists. But I think that when you're working in perspective, the more you can do freehand, the more you are setting yourself up for <strong>long-term freedom in drawing</strong>.</p>

<p>Thank you for that, Pamela D.</p>

<h3>Comments on Style</h3>

<p>Speaking of style, look at <strong>Joi</strong>. That is such good style, but it is so risky to show it as such because many of you may imprint this good style as something to copy rather than the more important thing here, which is the <strong>direction of lines</strong>. Look at how simply it reads, and it comes from what some of you, including Pamela D, are doing freehand.</p>

<p>Thanks for the note about that, Carlos. I'm your chorus, repeating what you've spoken with ornaments.</p>

<h2>Applying Perspective in Storytelling and Comics</h2>

<p>Now we'll end this response to the rooms by noting what <strong>William Montalvo</strong> said about comics in one of the comments. This is important for storytellers.</p>

<p>Spike Lee, in his MasterClass trailer, mentioned that whether you look up at a character or down at a character affects the feeling. He particularly mentioned that typically when we look up at a character, we feel like that character has more power than us and could be a threat, but not necessarily.</p>

<p>It can be the opposite of that. People who do children's books know this. I had a teacher who did many children's books, and he pointed out that typically you put the <strong>eye level of the child</strong> into the book so that the child looks at it and says, "This is the way I see the world", the gum under the table, looking up into the grownups, because that lets them know that <strong>this is for me</strong>.</p>

<p>But not necessarily, kids like to be lifted up and flown over their environment. And so you get the <em>Where's Waldo</em> approach to looking down on everything.</p>

<p>There is no rule about this, and it is not our problem here for what height is best. But here's my question: How can an artist use their talent and wisdom for how high or how low to place the viewer without either knowing this, if they're drawing, or at least struggling with it to heighten awareness that it is a view from a <strong>point of view</strong>?</p>

<p>You are working here to set up your skills in placing a view. Wisdom for where to place it can come later.</p>

<h2>Extra Challenges: Twisting Arrows and Floating Anvils</h2>

<p>Now, before we end this critique, we should look at the arrows and the anvil, which sounds like a Celtic folk song.</p>

<p>I didn't put these onto you as assignments, I hoped that they would inspire you to do likewise, and apparently they did. Some of you did better versions than mine.</p>

<p>Let's look.</p>

<h3>Response to Rovy's Twisting Arrow</h3>

<p><strong>Rovy</strong>, I hope that's how to pronounce your name, but you certainly ran with it. Wow! Showing us around the permutations of twisted arrows.</p>

<p><strong>Cass</strong>, good job.</p>

<p><strong>Kaiju</strong> said, "You explain everything so well, Marshall, that I feel like I understood it right away. I was expecting to struggle a lot more than I did after all your warnings. I was surprised to find out that it made immediate sense when I sat down to do it myself."</p>

<p>Not everybody has that experience, but yes, it is very difficult, and yet you went in being surprised that it is doable. Good work.</p>

<p>Look at that.</p>

<p><strong>Vange</strong> or <strong>Vanji</strong> as we scroll through these.</p>

<p><strong>Blondie</strong>, the "good, in response to my response, went ballistic", rides on curved and twisting.</p>

<p><strong>Rupert DDD</strong> found it difficult to smoothly transition from box to box, so you tried 2D slices, which seemed to work better. You found it difficult to make the transition smooth, but you moved beyond your teacher, and you are rivaling those pros who do this easily. Wow.</p>

<p><strong>Maria G</strong> did a Möbius strip and animated it.</p>

<p><strong>Rick B</strong> used the teacher as a touchstone and then did one of his own.</p>

<p><strong>Lucy</strong>, who got it started, I think.</p>

<p>We should have celebratory music here.</p>

<p>Man went wild, arrow bending and mind bending. Look at that.</p>

<p><strong>Andreas</strong> did a model and gave step-by-step. Wow, great.</p>

<p>So did <strong>Daniella</strong>, step by step animated, and another step by step, and another step by step animated, and another step by step animated.</p>

<p><strong>Cita</strong> robbing, and so much more.</p>

<p>Ten times what I expected, sorry for not showcasing everyone, but go there and look. And not just the twisting arrow, but the curving arrow.</p>

<p>Look at how much everybody put into this, a non-assignment, and yet be glad for having a community like seldom happens for this skill.</p>

<p>This is fine.</p>

<h3>Response to Students' Work on Anvils</h3>

<p>Let's take a quick look at the many anvils, some of which I made responses to in the comments to cheer you on, encourage, or at least acknowledge.</p>

<p><strong>Han</strong>, I hope I got your name right. Let me know if this was right. I've been saying it everywhere I go, people think that I am crazy, but they can't help picking it up. I've got a neighborhood of people that are walking around saying, "Han, Han, Han!" I figured it out from what you wrote.</p>

<p>But Han, hey, come on, it's great work, but let's get them level.</p>

<p>And here's where I did the thing that Stan couldn't do, he made books float, I made an anvil float.</p>

<p>And so did many of you. Look at the meticulous care with which this lesson was invested. This is advanced stuff, and when you're doing it from an angle that I didn't demo, I know you learned.</p>

<p>Now, <strong>Maria</strong>, I used the 3D model from the basics course. I didn't know there was a 3D model in the basics course, gee, that would've helped.</p>

<p>But doing them purely out of imaginative, guesstimated measuring is the real work here. So my anvil has a slightly different shape, but here are my orthos and the three viewpoints.</p>

<p>Okay, looking at those orthos and translating it is the kind of thing you would do after more instruction than I've given you. But you have done it, so congratulations.</p>

<p>And you also mentioned in the first one, looking from above, that'd be this one, "I feel like I didn't foreshorten the anvil enough, and it looks very elongated." I think the other two are better. Also, it really helped to start with drawing cross-sections of the anvil box in yellow. This helped me see the box as dimensional, not just a bunch of crisscrossing lines.</p>

<p>Yes, indeed. Those sections are how boats are built. <strong>Mon Barker</strong> did an example of this, it's called <strong>lofting</strong>. In the curved arrow image, you can go look at what Mon did.</p>

<p>The curves of boats are so complex that they seem impossible, so the solution evolved to simply build coronal sections and then bend wood to connect the sections. We did some of that here, you partook and discovered its value.</p>

<p>Thanks for posting, Maria, and I trust the question about three- and four-point is resolved by now. I answered it the best I could here, we'll develop the answer more, two lesson groups from now.</p>

<p><strong>Hans</strong> is worthy as a climactic image. Great job. Hans, Hans, Hans, Hans.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p>Here's what's coming next.</p>

<p>The question that so many students ask is, <strong>how do I know exactly where the vanishing points go?</strong> How do you make a square in perspective and know that it is exactly a square?</p>

<p>And the answer is always, <strong>it depends</strong>. But apart from the "depends" caveats, it requires <strong>decisive decisions</strong> that I will put you onto for one and a half lesson groups to get this <strong>"how exactly"</strong> business out of the way. And you'll know it's there, and you can use it if you like.</p>

<p>It's a big deal historically of perspective as a science.</p>

<p>Then we will move into <strong>close-up and wide-angle views</strong>, just touching on the science of it for half a lesson so we can get to the more useful skill of making it up for effect.</p>

<p>That's happening in the coming lesson groups.</p>

<p>See you soon.</p>
