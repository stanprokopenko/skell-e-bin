<p>In this lesson, I'll walk you through my process for drawing facial features, focusing on the connection between underlying structure and surface details. We'll take a more informal approach, building up the features step-by-step while maintaining flexibility to adjust and refine as we go.</p>

<h2>Setting Up the Basic Structure</h2>

<p>I start with my perspective setup as a guide, aiming for a softer interpretation of the features. I'll use hatching primarily for form and light/shadow, as it's the best way to maintain a sense of play without relying too heavily on edges or intense light and shadow.</p>

<h2>Drawing the Eye</h2>

<p>Let's begin with the eye. I place the initial eye shape, considering how it relates to the nose placement. I think about the <strong>canthal ligament</strong> and how it attaches, then establish the center split.</p>

<p>As I build the eye, I imagine <strong>wrapping a band across a ball</strong> or a long box across a ball, developing a corner on it. This creates the housing for the eye, combining the bony plate with fat and skin. I then arc this shape around, noticing how it becomes more heavily shadowed as it recedes.</p>

<p>I consider the brow area, thinking about how much to push the brow structure. This helps me place the eyebrow, which I might even think of in perspective if I wanted to be extra precise.</p>

<p>For the iris and pupil, I draw an ellipse. If the other eye were visible, I might add a little target to help place the gaze and ensure both eyes are looking in the same direction.</p>

<p>When drawing the lower lid, I try to <strong>push on the shape so that the presence of the eye impacts the design of the lid</strong>. It comes out, around, hits, wobbles a bit, and then sweeps back with the larger form.</p>

<h2>Developing the Nose</h2>

<p>Moving to the nose, I consider the transition from the eye socket. There's a drop back of the socket, a curve up, and then it peaks at the saddle. I think about the plane of the nose, bringing it up and noting how the saddle has a bit of a break or arch.</p>

<p>I build down and back into an understanding of the cartilage. The nose goes up, then drops, which is something I want to show in how the nose is developed. </p>

<p>For the end of the nose, I think of it as round but relatively sharp. I use the highlight as a great area of plane change, thinking over the nose and turning the form to soften out some of the boxy areas.</p>

<p>The underside of the nose is crucial. I think about the bell shape of the nostril and use that to curve any harsh transitions. I'm always trying to make the differences in plane as clear as I can, showing how the build-up of perspective underneath impacts the smaller parts.</p>

<h2>Placing the Mouth</h2>

<p>When working on the mouth, I start by relating it to the other features. I think about the <strong>philtrum shape</strong> and how it extends down. The most important line is the wrapping line of the lips.</p>

<p>I consider where the center of the lips should be and how it relates to the larger form around the denture sphere. I wrap the lip shape back and reintroduce it to the ball form, pushing up over the perspective.</p>

<p>For the lower lip, I think about it coming forward and back, sweeping back up. As long as it hits back to that initial area of movement across the form, we get our three planes on the bottom.</p>

<h2>Adding the Ear</h2>

<p>For the ear, I start with a basic C shape, then remember it could have five different planes. Inside the C, I might add a question mark or hook shape, a Y shape, and then a wobble or W shape.</p>

<p>I design the basic three shapes first, leading into the lobe at the bottom. Then, like with everything else, once I have my shapes and design mapped out, I come back in to develop an understanding of the surface and basic perspectives.</p>

<h2>Refining and Adjusting</h2>

<p>Throughout the process, I revisit and refine. I might go back up and through, think through the development, push some things around, move some parts, and play with the proportion and placement of things. </p>

<p>I might soften the brow, adjust the mouth shape, or shift the nose slightly. The key is to maintain flexibility and keep refining until everything feels right.</p>

<h2>Adding Anatomical Details</h2>

<p>As I near the end, I might start to think about some of the larger deposits of fat, like around the cheek and onto the mouth. I also consider muscles like the <strong>masseter</strong>, which can add a nice form to the back of the jaw.</p>

<p>Remember, this approach is about making the connection between the under structure, the development of the surface, and the architecture of the skull. It's about building and initiating an understanding of the form of the features and their more complex surfaces on top.</p>

<p>This process sets you up well for introducing more concrete ideas of lighting or starting to render. Keep this in mind for your upcoming lessons as you practice connecting underlying structure to surface details in your own drawings.</p>
