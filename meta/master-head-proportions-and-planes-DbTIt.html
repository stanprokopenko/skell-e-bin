<h2>Roadmap Overview</h2>

<p>In this guide, we'll walk through a detailed roadmap for drawing the human head. Each step is designed to help you make concrete and objective assessments about your work. We just completed step five, which focused on proportions. Now, we'll transition into understanding the side plane of the head and move towards more detailed anatomical features.</p>

<h2>Understanding the Side Plane of the Head</h2>

<p>The side plane of the head marks the transition from the front to the top of the head. The hairline is a crucial marker here, even though it can vary greatly among individuals. The hairline represents the point where the forehead stops, and the top of the head begins. This line, when extended to the back of the head, indicates a consistent change in surface and texture. Above this line, the skull is rounded and dome-like, while below it, the skull becomes sheer and concave.</p>

<h2>The Temporal Fossa</h2>

<p>The temporal fossa is a significant cutout on the side of your head where one of the two muscles used for mastication sits. To locate the temporal fossa, you need four key points:

- <strong>Hairline</strong>

- <strong>Base of the nose</strong>

- <strong>Temple</strong>

- <strong>Back of the skull</strong></p>

<p>These points help establish the height and width of the temporal fossa. Once identified, you can extrude this area, transitioning from simple geometry to a more sculpted form.</p>

<h2>Placement and Design of the Ear and Jaw</h2>

<p>To find the ear's position, divide the side plane into quarters. The ear typically resides in the back quarter. Start by drawing a simple C shape for the ear, but remember that most ears consist of five planes. Adjust the length and shape to match your reference.</p>

<p>For the jaw, consider the angle and shape. Is it more angular and straight, or smoother with less of a break? Use two lines to define the jaw and adjust as needed to match your subject.</p>

<h2>Developing the Cheekbone and Its Rhythm</h2>

<p>To establish the cheekbone's rhythm, you can use the top of the ear as a reference. One method is to draw a big C curve from the top of the ear to the corner of the chin. This creates a rhythm that helps define the side plane of the face. The cheekbone's design can vary, so feel free to experiment with different methods.</p>

<h2>Constructing the Eye Sockets and Nose</h2>

<p>There are various approaches to drawing the eye sockets. One method is to create a big cut that resembles Cyclops from the X-Men, emphasizing the lean and plane changes of the forehead and sockets. This helps you understand the spatial relationships and architecture of the face.</p>

<p>For the nose, summarize the cartilage and nasal aperture. You can use a grid to study the structure and refine your drawing.</p>

<h2>Adding the Denture Sphere</h2>

<p>The denture sphere is crucial for understanding the orientation of mass in the face. It helps you see how the teeth contribute to the overall structure before adding lips. This ensures that the lips look natural and participate with the surface of the teeth.</p>

<h2>Finalizing with Features and Fat Deposits</h2>

<p>The final step involves adding features and understanding the role of subcutaneous fat in facial aesthetics. Around the eye, there are five fat deposits that influence its appearance. The canthral ligament, which straps the eye in place, is also important. The tilt and angle of the eye can significantly affect the perception of beauty.</p>

<p>Women typically have more retroobicularis oris fat (roof fat), which is often considered beautiful because it hides the hard surface of the skull. This fat deposit is accentuated with makeup and contributes to the uplifted appearance of the lash and eye.</p>

<p>By following this roadmap, you'll have a structured approach to drawing the human head, allowing you to create more accurate and expressive portraits.</p>
