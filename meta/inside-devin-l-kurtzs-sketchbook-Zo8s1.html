<h2>Studying from Reference</h2>

<p>My sketchbook is my <strong>practice zone</strong>, different from an art sketchbook where I work on finished pieces. Here, I focus on <strong>studying from reference</strong> to <strong>memorize material</strong>. I fill it with sketches of <strong>plants</strong>, <strong>motorcycle gear</strong>, <strong>animals</strong>, and <strong>everyday objects</strong>. I draw from life, like my <strong>40 house plants</strong>, and from resources like <strong>Pinterest</strong> and specialized <strong>Instagram accounts</strong>.</p>

<h2>Building a Visual Library</h2>

<p>I believe in drawing <strong>many versions of the same thing</strong> to expand my <strong>visual library</strong>. This helps me avoid drawing generic objects. For example, I don't want to draw just a chair, I want a chair that has <strong>attitude</strong>, a history, and tells you something about the character. To achieve this, I study various <strong>lamps</strong>, <strong>chairs</strong>, <strong>glass bottles</strong>, and other items by browsing furniture stores, collecting references.</p>

<h2>Telling Stories Through Objects</h2>

<p>Objects can say so much about a character. I explore how different designs can reflect personality. For instance, I love drawing <strong>chairs</strong> because they can reveal a lot about who uses them. What kind of chair would you sit in if you were an animated version of yourself? I think about these details to enhance the storytelling in my work.</p>

<h2>Learning from Other Artists</h2>

<p>I study the works of other artists, like <strong>Milt Kahl's hands</strong> from classic animations and <strong>Glen Keane's Tarzan</strong> hands. Hands can express so much <strong>emotion</strong> and <strong>weight</strong>. I do <strong>studies in pen</strong> because its permanence makes me think carefully about each line. Mistakes become learning opportunities, helping me understand where I can improve.</p>

<h2>Embracing Mistakes with Pen</h2>

<p>Working in pen forces me to <strong>accept mistakes</strong> and move on. By leaving errors on the page, I can look back and identify patterns in my drawing that need attention. It encourages me to be <strong>less finicky</strong> and more decisive with my lines.</p>

<h2>Practicing Compositions</h2>

<p>Once I feel confident drawing an object, I create <strong>compositions</strong> with it. I practice arranging objects, considering <strong>big</strong>, <strong>medium</strong>, and <strong>small shapes</strong>, and varying their <strong>height</strong>, <strong>width</strong>, <strong>sharpness</strong>, and <strong>roundness</strong>. Composing a collection of objects is similar to arranging a lineup of characters. It's about creating a <strong>pleasing and balanced</strong> arrangement.</p>

<h2>From Studies to Imagination</h2>

<p>I love drawing <strong>reptiles</strong>, especially when turning them into dragons for my books. Studying animals like <strong>geckos</strong>, <strong>bearded dragons</strong>, and <strong>sailfin lizards</strong> informs my creature designs. By understanding their <strong>shapes</strong> and <strong>forms</strong>, I can draw them from imagination, pose them dynamically, and inject personality into them.</p>

<h2>Storing Knowledge Internally</h2>

<p>I don't often look back at my sketches. Instead, I focus on <strong>storing the knowledge internally</strong>. The process of drawing helps me build <strong>muscle memory</strong> and a <strong>mental library</strong> that I can draw upon when creating original work.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p>My sketchbook is a place for <strong>exploration</strong> and <strong>learning</strong>. By filling it with diverse studies and embracing the process, I expand my abilities and bring more depth to my art. Whether it's through studying objects, learning from other artists, or turning reptiles into dragons, each sketch helps me <strong>grow as an artist</strong>.</p>
