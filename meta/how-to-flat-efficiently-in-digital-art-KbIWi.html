<p>Flatting is the process of adding base colors to your digital artwork. It's a crucial step that helps set the tone and structure of your piece. While it may seem simple, almost like coloring in a coloring book, there are many strategies that can make flatting more <strong>efficient</strong> and your artwork more <strong>flexible</strong> in later stages.</p>

<h2>What is Flatting?</h2>

<p>Flatting involves laying down base colors in your artwork. It's especially useful if you build up your piece through flat colors and want a more graphic approach. Even if your art style doesn't require strict flatting, it's a valuable technique to set a baseline for your piece's dominant look.</p>

<h2>Why Flatting is Important</h2>

<p>At first glance, flatting seems brain-dead simple: just color it in like you're in preschool. But there are many aspects that can make things easier for you later. Proper flatting gives you the <strong>flexibility</strong> to change things more easily. If your flats are organized and grouped well, adjustments become much simpler down the line.</p>

<h2>Strategies for Flatting</h2>

<h3>The Order of Flatting</h3>

<p>When flatting, having a streamlined system helps keep your layers organized. Instead of labeling layers by what they are or what color they are, consider an order that makes sense to you and helps you find layers quickly.</p>

<h4>Light to Dark, Warm to Cool</h4>

<p>I go from <strong>light to dark</strong>, <strong>warm to cool</strong>. Starting with the lighter, warmer colors, like whites and skin tones, and moving towards the darker, cooler colors helps me know where layers are. For example, blues are cool and tend to be dark, so I know they will be towards the bottom of my layers.</p>

<h3>Choosing Colors</h3>

<h4>Starting with a Middle Gray</h4>

<p>When starting with whites, change your background color to something that makes white stand out. Also, <strong>never start with a stark, bright white</strong>. Instead, use a <strong>middle gray</strong>, either a cool or warm gray, depending on the direction your piece is going. This reserves part of the spectrum for your highlights later.</p>

<h4>Using Value and RGB Sliders</h4>

<p>I tend to use <strong>value</strong> as the way I pick colors. Instead of relying on a traditional color wheel, I use the <strong>RGB sliders</strong>. This allows me to think about color in terms of <strong>warm versus cool</strong>. By moving sliders towards warm or cool, you can create color combinations you might not have thought of, and it helps you learn about color theory.</p>

<h3>Approaches to Flatting</h3>

<p>There are several approaches to flatting. You can choose based on what feels more natural or efficient for you.</p>

<h4>Manual Coloring</h4>

<p>The most straightforward method is to simply start painting the areas you want to color, carefully staying within the lines.</p>

<h4>Over-Coloring and Erasing</h4>

<p>Another approach is to <strong>over-color</strong> the lines, going past them intentionally. Then, go back and erase the excess. This can sometimes be faster, especially if you're not worried about being precise on the first pass.</p>

<h4>Lasso Tool and Color Fill</h4>

<p>You can also use the <strong>lasso tool</strong> with the <strong>color fill</strong> option. This involves selecting areas with the lasso tool and filling them with color. It can be less natural but effective for some shapes.</p>

<h4>Using Reference Layers and Automatic Selection</h4>

<p>If your line art is clean, you can set your line art layer as a <strong>reference layer</strong>. Then, using <strong>automatic selection</strong>, you can quickly select and fill areas based on your line work. Be aware that this method requires clean lines without gaps, and it might not work as well if your lines are textured or not fully opaque.</p>

<h3>Combining Approaches</h3>

<p>Don't feel locked into one method. Often, combining these approaches works best. For example, you might use automatic selection where your lines are clean and switch to manual coloring in areas where the selection doesn't work as well.</p>

<h2>Tips for Efficient Flatting</h2>

<h3>Keeping Layers Organized</h3>

<p>Organizing your layers is <strong>crucial</strong>. By having a consistent order, like going from light to dark or warm to cool, you can easily find and adjust layers later. This is especially important when you have many layers.</p>

<h3>Limiting Your Palette</h3>

<p>Try to keep your colors <strong>limited</strong> at first. Reuse the same colors for multiple areas if they are within a close enough range. This helps establish a <strong>baseline palette</strong> and makes adjustments easier. Limiting your colors also creates a more cohesive look throughout your piece.</p>

<h3>Identifying Key Colors</h3>

<p>Sometimes, you have <strong>key colors</strong> in your piece that are important for a character or element. Start with those colors to ensure they <strong>read correctly</strong> and <strong>stand out</strong>. Knowing these colors early helps balance the rest of your palette. If a character has a signature color, consider where else that color can be used to balance the piece.</p>

<h3>Changing Background Colors to Spot Mistakes</h3>

<p>Changing your background color can help you spot areas you might have missed or mistakes in your coloring. Choose a contrasting color to make the areas you're working on stand out. By frequently changing the background color, you can catch and correct issues early.</p>

<h3>Using Alpha Lock</h3>

<p>Once you have your flats down, you can <strong>alpha lock</strong> your layers. This locks the transparency, allowing you to paint or adjust colors only within the existing painted areas. It's helpful for tweaking colors without affecting other parts of your artwork.</p>

<h3>Managing Your Time</h3>

<p>Flatting can be a bit boring, but it can also be relaxing. Use this time to listen to a podcast or have a conversation. It's an opportunity to <strong>zone out</strong> while still being productive.</p>

<h3>Flexibility and Combining Methods</h3>

<p>Sometimes, the best approach is to be <strong>flexible</strong>. Combine different flatting methods based on what works best for each area of your artwork. If one method isn't working well in a particular area, switch to another. Being adaptable can make your flatting process smoother and more efficient.</p>

<h2>Common Mistakes and How to Fix Them</h2>

<h3>Not Keeping Layers Organized</h3>

<p>One common mistake is <strong>not keeping your layers organized</strong>. This can make adjustments later much more difficult. Stick to a consistent layer order to save time and energy later.</p>

<h3>Starting with Bright White</h3>

<p>Another mistake is starting with a bright white for your whites. <strong>Always start with a middle gray</strong> to reserve room for highlights later. This gives you more flexibility when adding details and highlights.</p>

<h3>Ignoring Line Art Gaps</h3>

<p>If your line art isn't clean or has gaps, methods like automatic selection can cause issues. Take the time to <strong>clean up your line art</strong> or be prepared to manually adjust flats in these areas. Filling in gaps can save you time and frustration during the flatting process.</p>

<h3>Overcomplicating the Process</h3>

<p>Don't overcomplicate flatting. Focus on getting the base colors down and organized. You can always adjust colors and details later. Keeping it simple makes the process more manageable and enjoyable.</p>

<p>Flatting is an <strong>essential step</strong> in your digital art process. By using these strategies and tips, you can make your flatting more efficient and set yourself up for easier adjustments later. Remember to stay <strong>flexible</strong>, combine approaches as needed, and keep your layers <strong>organized</strong>. In the next stage, we'll talk about creating the palette for your piece and adding lighting and shading.</p>
