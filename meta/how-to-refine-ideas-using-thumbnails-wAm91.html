<h2>Exploring a New Idea</h2>

<p>After wrapping up my initial thumbnail, I believe that <strong>no idea is a good idea if it's the only one you have</strong>. So, I'm moving on to a second thumbnail to see where else I can take this concept. This time, I want to explore the idea of the <strong>Fantastic Four working together</strong> on something, as opposed to relaxing.</p>

<p>My new idea is to depict them <strong>building a retro flying saucer</strong>. I love the old hovercraft and flying saucer sci-fi tropes, especially with a <strong>World War II era</strong> aesthetic. So, Reed is working on the ship, and everyone else is pitching in to help.</p>

<h2>Sketching the Composition</h2>

<p>I start by sketching the <strong>flying saucer</strong> at the top, making sure it doesn't create any tangents with the title. I'm incorporating the title into the piece more this time. </p>

<p>I'm focusing on <strong>Ben</strong> as a central figure. He's <strong>holding up the ship with one arm</strong>, showcasing his strength, and casually <strong>holding a coffee cup</strong> in the other hand. This adds a fun contradiction to his tough appearance.</p>

<p>Next, I position <strong>Reed</strong>, using his stretchy powers to work on both the top and bottom of the ship simultaneously. He's using an <strong>old-school wrench</strong>, which adds to the retro feel. </p>

<p><strong>Sue</strong> is levitating Reed's toolbox to him, using her powers to assist. I need to find the right placement for her to avoid overcrowding the composition.</p>

<p><strong>Johnny</strong> is providing refreshment support. He's walking in a playful, exaggerated pose, carrying a tray of hot drinks. I like the idea of his hand turning into flame to <strong>heat the tray</strong>, and perhaps he's handing a drink to Ben, who is delicately taking it with "tea fingers".</p>

<h2>Avoiding Tangents and Overlaps</h2>

<p>As I sketch, I'm careful to <strong>avoid tangents</strong> and ensure <strong>good overlaps</strong> to create depth. Thumbnails are crucial for this because they help me see where elements might clash or crowd each other. I often have to adjust the sizes and positions of characters to maintain a balanced composition.</p>

<p>I play with the idea of incorporating the <strong>Fantastic Four logo</strong> into the background as a circular motif, inspired by <strong>Rockwellian</strong> design tropes. This adds an interesting element and ties the composition together.</p>

<h2>Refining the Design</h2>

<p>I'm simplifying my <strong>value scheme</strong> to a true three-value design. This helps me clarify the composition and ensure the focal points stand out. Adding a <strong>cast shadow</strong> from the ship onto the characters creates depth and connects the elements.</p>

<h2>Adding Color</h2>

<p>I decide to incorporate color into the thumbnail to get a sense of the final piece. Using a <strong>blue base</strong> for the overall image, I add complementary <strong>orange tones</strong> for contrast, particularly on elements like Ben's skin and any fiery effects from Johnny.</p>

<h2>Preparing for the Final Painting</h2>

<p>At this point, the thumbnail has all the answers I need. Before moving on to the final painting, I'll <strong>gather reference materials</strong>, perhaps <strong>shoot some photos</strong>, and make sure I have all the details right. This includes understanding how the <strong>porcelain of the coffee cups</strong> reflects light or how the <strong>flying saucer</strong> should look.</p>

<p>By solving these challenges in the thumbnail stage, I ensure that the final painting process is smoother and more successful. I'm excited about where this concept is going and look forward to bringing it to life in the finished piece.</p>
