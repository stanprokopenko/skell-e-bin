<p>All right, it's time for some feedback on your wonderful work. I see that a lot of you have come in here and done paintings and tried light from different angles. First off, I'd just like to say I'm super proud of you. I think this is amazing. So let's dive in.</p>

<h2>Anthony's Paintings</h2>

<h3>Sunset Version</h3>

<p>You captured this really well. It definitely feels like sunlight. The light kind of dominates the image. I can see where the sun is coming from. I can clearly see where your rim light is.</p>

<p>The only thing that I would suggest here is that your foreground is a little bit lighter than your mid-ground. With fog and atmosphere, you will always have the <strong>darkest elements close to the camera</strong> because there's less particulate between the camera and the object itself. As you go into space, the <strong>darks will get lighter</strong>. You have this pretty good with your mountains here, and the sun is the brightest, but the darks in the castle are darker than in the foreground.</p>

<p>So let's take the foreground and add some more dark into it. This way, we'll get better separation. I'm not changing the brights here, I'm just kind of adding a little bit more dark. I'm using <strong>curves</strong>, and curves work where you can adjust the brights and the darks. I'm adding a little bit of contrast here.</p>

<p>Let's take the mid-ground and do the opposite. I'm going to do a curves adjustment, and go into the <strong>red channel</strong>. If I haven't described how this works with the red, the green, and the blue, <strong>RGB curves inside of Photoshop</strong>, almost every painting program has this. This dot here represents all of the darks. So if I raise this, it is going to lighten the darks. This represents the lights. If I bring this down, it is going to darken the brights. Then I can grab anywhere in between, the mid values, I can pull up the mid values and make this brighter, or pull the whole thing down and make it darker.</p>

<p>So I'm going to lift the darks in the mid-ground on the red channel. This will <strong>push a little bit of warm atmosphere into the darks</strong> of that mid-ground. If I really pull this high, you can see what it's doing. To me, I want to clearly see that character in the foreground separated from the mid-ground and the background.</p>

<p>So here's a before and after of where we were, and now you get a little bit more depth of that foreground cliff with that little bit more contrast. Otherwise, I think this is really beautiful.</p>

<h3>Nighttime Version</h3>

<p>When we think about moonlight lighting something and the sky being black at night, often people will make the mistake of thinking that mountains will be brighter because they're lit by the moon and the sky will be black. But it's actually the <strong>opposite</strong>. The <strong>sky is the brightest light in the scene</strong>, and everything else is darker. There's not as much light.</p>

<p>So I already did a paint over, and what I wanted to do was <strong>darken those mountains and make the sky a little bit brighter</strong>. This is the way real light works. If you look at night photography, there will always be kind of a glow in the sky, and mountains will often be a silhouette because they just can't bounce as much light as what you will see in the sky.</p>

<p>I have taken your far mountain and darkened it slightly. Then I have taken the sky and <strong>raised it up using curves</strong> just a little bit. Then I added a couple of extra things. I thought that maybe a couple of <strong>fog layers</strong> would help ever so slightly.</p>

<p>I want to see the character in the foreground. Right now, the character is kind of getting lost. We have a <strong>lost edge</strong> where the character blends into the background. You have the dot of the lamp that they're holding, and we can fix that by making a <strong>new glow layer</strong>. This layer is in <strong>add mode</strong>, and I've added a little bit of glow so we can see that character, a little bit of bloom in the sky. And then, just for good separation between that foreground character and the background, I could add just a little bit of fog.</p>

<p>So that would be my suggestion for your nighttime. You're pretty close. I think it looks good. I've also refined your sky just slightly. I got rid of some of the brushiness and did a little bit of blending to get more cloud-like details.</p>

<h3>Laser Light</h3>

<p>I also love putting the laser here. I think this is really cool to see this laser light. Let's take its opacity down just a little. Let's try some experiments here.</p>

<p>What if we did a <strong>curves adjustment just on the laser light</strong>? We could take the reds down in the bright areas, take the greens down, and add more blue saturation to this. It's mostly white, so let's take the actual curves here. This will allow for some light to shine through.</p>

<p>Instead of <strong>lighten</strong>, let's put it into <strong>add mode</strong> and take its opacity down just slightly. Same with this one. I have to play with this to see, but what I'm going for is I want to see <strong>less brightness in the actual beams and more brightness where it hits the ground</strong>.</p>

<p>Let's try this again. If we do a curves adjustment and we just bring the whole thing down a little, I just want to see that blue shining through. Then I'm going to add a <strong>new layer</strong> right here, put this also in <strong>add mode</strong>, and let's let where it hits the surface really, really glow. So I have a soft brush, this is where it's hitting the ground, and that light will kind of explode out into the scene.</p>

<p>That is the laser light hitting the brightest point. Let's make this even brighter and a little more cyan, to really make that feel like a laser light. The laser is so strong where it hits, it'll be like an explosion of bounce light shining there. Instead of the whole thing being bright, we'll have the beams just hitting the mist a little bit and hitting the particles in the air, and the <strong>brightest point will be on the ground where it hits</strong>. Super cool. I love that idea.</p>

<h3>Night with Fog</h3>

<p>For your night with the fog, I looked at your layers, and I think your layers are just too strong. This feels more like you're just painting with white on top, and what we need is for it to integrate into the scene.</p>

<p>So I took the nighttime version that we had done, and then I <strong>added fog</strong> to this. The same things with the background, with the layering of it gets brighter as you go into the distance, and I want to make sure that the <strong>mountains are darker than the sky</strong>.</p>

<p>Then I painted with my fog layers in <strong>add mode</strong>. So it will only lighten, it's just going to lift this. So this looks very similar to the nighttime version, only there's a lot more fog. It's kind of lifting the whole scene. So this could be one of the foggy setups.</p>

<h3>Sunlight from the Left</h3>

<p>For your sun coming from the left, I think you've done a good job of the light. I can see clearly the <strong>directionality of the light</strong>. One thing that we could do to this is just <strong>clean up the lines a little bit</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Soft shadows versus sharp shadows</strong> - the believability of sharp shadows will really say that is a cast shadow from that building. Right here, this is a little bit smudgy. I'm going to switch to my paintbrush here, and I just feel like with sunlight, maybe we could <strong>sharpen the edge of these shadows</strong>. If we paint a sharper line where that contact point of the shadows is, that is going to help the edges feel more believable.</p>

<p>The other thing that I think is important is you have basically bright orange and dark orange, so you're adding black. This is a common way of thinking, like with people that have done a lot of pencil work, where you start bright and then you just darken down. But you've got to remember there's a <strong>secondary light source</strong> here. It's not just the sun, there's the <strong>blue of the sky</strong>.</p>

<p>So on this rooftop, you have some colors that are more in those kind of <strong>cool grays</strong>. Let's get a little bit of that onto the cliffs as well. We want to feel like there is a secondary light source that is the sky, and that sky is going to <strong>fill in the shadow</strong>.</p>

<p>There's no such thing as a shadow color. Shadows are just black, but most of what happens in a shadow <strong>comes from a different light source</strong>, and usually that light source is the sky. So I think if we use the sky to fill in with just a little bit of gray, this gray color is going to look blue in comparison to the scene.</p>

<p>Maybe we do it on this foreground character as well. Just fill in that shadow with a little bit of light from the sky. We can use that as the way to add extra rim light and shaping onto the cliff. Maybe I did that a little too much here, but we need to be very subtle with it. I just want to see a little bit of <strong>cool in the shadows because of the sky</strong>.</p>

<p>And then the last thing is this mid-ground hill almost feels like it's <strong>too orange</strong>. You have super orange, mid-orange, and then that back hill feels about right for me, but this one I think needs a little bit more cool.</p>

<p>I'm going to make a new layer, put it into <strong>add mode</strong>, and make a clipping mask, so this will only affect this layer. Now let me paint in some of that kind of sky tone into this. Maybe not in add mode, I'll use normal mode and paint some of that color of the atmosphere there in the shadows.</p>

<p>Again, we want <strong>cool in the shadows</strong>, so I don't want quite so much orange in the shadow part of this. I want a little bit more of the cool light, like the background. And that's really going to help us feel like there's atmosphere in the air.</p>

<p>Can you see the difference of what that does? It just kind of makes it a little bit more integrated.</p>

<h3>Final Scene</h3>

<p>And lastly, for this scene here, I think we're suffering from the same issue. You have colors in the foreground, local colors in the foreground, you have all these beautiful purples and oranges, this complementary color in this background mountain, but then the far mountain actually gets <strong>darker</strong>. It's almost like the atmosphere disappeared.</p>

<p>So what if we were to <strong>lift the blacks</strong>, the darks from that far mountain? I also have a layer here of fog. You can kind of see the difference here where I'm just using curves. I've added a little bit of <strong>purple into the darks on that far hill</strong>.</p>

<p>And I've also, on the foreground hill, done the same. I've taken some of those emerald greens and allowed for that strong light that is very purple and red that's coming through the scene to <strong>shift those values from greens a little bit more towards warm colors</strong>. So it'll feel like they're lit.</p>

<p>Then I added a new layer here with a <strong>glow layer</strong>, and this will just give extra light from the sun that is just off screen, and it is coming into the scene. What I need this for is to <strong>separate this character</strong>. We have another lost edge, where this character just disappears. My eye goes to the contrast of the castle, and then the character's kind of gone, it's just in the same value range.</p>

<p>If we have a little bit of fog, now I can see that character again, and you have good separation of the layers, but a much more believable light.</p>

<h2>Onigi's Paintings</h2>

<h3>Generic Light</h3>

<p>Your mountain here, I think in this first one, there needs to be a little bit more gradient. Right now, with this kind of flat generic light, I don't see quite enough gradient.</p>

<p>I've done a paint over here just to see a little bit more change in the value structure. I've painted in a few different layers of darkening, little gradients to see the <strong>soft shadows in the ambient light</strong>. There's not a lot of direct light source here.</p>

<p>You could paint in some level of directionality of light, just to help separate the building from the background. So I've put a light coming from screen left onto this, slightly rim light. It's not as bright as the sunlight, but it could be used to help really see the shape and the form a little bit better.</p>

<p>Doing gray light is a tough challenge, so good job with this one.</p>

<h3>Second Painting</h3>

<p>Your second one here, I think just needs a little bit of cleanup. I think taking your brush and making it smaller. Let's look at what I've done here.</p>

<p>I'm looking at levels of <strong>contrast and sharpness</strong> in certain areas. So this is what I did with this. I removed some of the contrast in the mid-ground hill. There are some areas of dark and light throughout the whole thing. This mountain back here has a lot of dark. The castle has the <strong>darkest dark</strong>, and then there are little spots of dark.</p>

<p>What we want is a <strong>layering of depth</strong>, and there is atmosphere in here. So I made sure that the <strong>foreground character is the darkest dark</strong>, and then the mid-ground castle is the second layer of dark, and then the mountains, the darkness levels are somewhat lifted.</p>

<p>You still have the same feeling of your piece, but we've made the layering a little bit cleaner. Then we've also <strong>sharpened up some of the lines</strong>. You can do this not just by having a big soft brush, you can have a sharper edge brush, make it smaller, and paint in some of those lines.</p>

<h3>Nighttime Version</h3>

<p>This one kind of looks like an alien spaceship top-down light. So this nighttime, we don't want to be too bright because the camera is exposed for this bright top-down light, so what I've done here is I've again <strong>sharpened the lines</strong> and <strong>removed some of the contrast</strong>.</p>

<p>Right now, you have dark, light, dark, light in the background mountain, and that draws my eye to that contrast. So if we can remove that contrast, also this area of extreme dark right here, it's darker than in the foreground, and so it makes the atmosphere look like something's not quite right.</p>

<p>So I have added a little bit more <strong>cool into that mid-ground hill</strong>. I have reduced the complexity of the contrast in that background mountain, kind of pulled up the darks, pulled down the brights back there so that that mountain just gets pushed into the background. This allows us to focus on the actual castle that's being lit.</p>

<p>I added an extra kind of <strong>glow layer</strong> here, so that we can really see. We don't want the direct light hitting the ground to be less bright than the fog, we want the fog to be less bright than where the light hits the ground. So if the light hits the ground, it should explode 'cause it's hitting a hard surface, and there's a big blast of color, that's where the light is hitting, and then the atmosphere is slightly less.</p>

<p>So that's what I did with adding this extra light and a little bit of <strong>bounce light</strong> onto this so it looks like light's hitting and bouncing back up.</p>

<h3>Final Painting</h3>

<p>This one suffers from the same issue where the mid-ground is <strong>darker than the foreground</strong> again. Let's reduce that, and then I'm also going to show you what I did here.</p>

<p>I first painted some of the light, like the sunlight back here might not wrap all the way around. So as that surface curves around the <strong>terminator edge</strong>, I'm shifting the light, where it goes into the purples.</p>

<p>I've also removed some of those dark spots. I wanted there to be a real <strong>clean edge to that sunlight, backlighting the castle</strong>. I did another layer, where I just made a gradient. Let's make sure we can see the <strong>cast shadows</strong>. <strong>Directionality of light is visualized through cast shadows</strong>. So if the light is coming from behind, we can see the sun there, then we have shadows that are coming towards the camera, away from that light, and that really helps believability to lock that castle into the space.</p>

<p>So I tightened that up a little bit, and let the light go into the purples here. Then I decided to add an extra <strong>glow layer</strong> from the sun. This is going to push those mountains, the darks in the foreground and the darks in the mountains are a little bit similar, so I'm going to have a little bit of light fog around the sun. This will kind of push those mountains back and reduce some contrast so that there's more contrast on the castle and on the house.</p>

<p>I also added, compared to yours, I darkened the backside of the castle but then added a kind of <strong>greenish rim light from the left</strong>. That helps again to give the shape and the form of the castle.</p>

<h2>Maya's Paintings</h2>

<p>You did some really beautiful work here. I don't have a lot of critiques of these. I think you did an excellent job. I can see the <strong>directionality</strong> of where the sun is, the mood, and the colors and tones of the sky are unique in each of these, and they're really beautiful.</p>

<h3>Minor Adjustments</h3>

<p>I did a couple of little paint overs. You can see the foreground and background difference here. Let's look right here, this one has some areas of really dark behind the castle that's in the distance. So let's <strong>lighten that up a little bit</strong> so that the mountain doesn't feel odd. Also, it's not very dark in the foreground, and it's dark right there, so I just painted to push that mountain back a little bit. Then I allowed the foreground hill to go a little bit darker, and especially the character to go seriously dark so that we can have that contrast.</p>

<p>On this one, there are very few changes, just a little bit of gradients into the <strong>soft shadows</strong> in this area where you're not in the direct sunlight. You're going to have these very soft <strong>ambient occluded shadows</strong>, and so I painted just a little bit of that in there.</p>

<h3>Directional Light</h3>

<p>This one over here, I just wanted to paint some <strong>cast shadows</strong> onto the castle from itself. You have the light coming from screen right, and in your version, it was a little bit flat. Again, almost everything is subtle gradients in the fill side, in the area that is lit just by the soft blue of the sky. Instead of it being one flat color, just having a little bit of a change in value and intensity of color temperature in there, where it shifts a little bit more saturated and gets a little bit dark around the creases, will just make it feel more believable.</p>

<p>Down here, I didn't have much to change except adding in a couple of little strips of blue where there'd be <strong>cast shadows</strong> from the castle.</p>

<h3>Light Variation</h3>

<p>This one too, I painted in little details of some of the light that is coming onto the hill. Maybe you want to make that foreground hill in shadow a little bit, I don't know. It works like this, just kind of flooded with a lot of light as well, but maybe we could darken the character a little bit.</p>

<p>And then this last one, I thought it was a little bit confusing because everything flattens out. It's almost like you have a beam of light coming from the side that's really strong, and I don't see any cast shadows here.</p>

<p>So if we can paint in just a little bit, maybe even vary that shadow because it's just so straight across everything. If we let there be areas where you can clearly see what's in shadow and then the light picks up again, maybe we put a little shadow in that mountain so that the edge of the castle really stands out.</p>

<p>I think that's going to just make it more convincing, more believable. See how like if you blur your eyes, you have this <strong>lost edge</strong>, the whole castle just disappears into the sunlight. But if you have a little bit of <strong>cast shadows</strong>, you can still see that shape and form. Beautiful work.</p>

<h3>Cube Studies</h3>

<p>The work you did with these cubes, I think it's perfect. I think it's great for what you're doing with this beginner-level painting class. I can really feel the <strong>materials</strong>. I can see how much <strong>light is bouncing</strong>. This is really convincing. I can see that little strip of light and what it would do in each of these circumstances with the different colors of light and the different materials.</p>

<p>I don't really have any critiques at this point. I think that this is really nicely done. I can see what is lit, I can see what is bounce, I can see the <strong>gradients of that light</strong>, and it's really sweet. I think it looks really good. Good job.</p>

<h2>Kasjan's Paintings</h2>

<p>These are really beautiful. I think that these are very fun. The last one with Godzilla in there is just so great. It just feels like this peaceful little European village, and then all of a sudden there's this terrible thing happening in the background.</p>

<h3>Gradient in Shadows</h3>

<p>These first ones, I think they're really nice. The only area that I would, there's a consistent theme as feedback for you, is to look at changing a little bit <strong>the gradients in the shadows</strong>. Right now, this building is pretty flat and kind of dusty looking. The light is kind of even.</p>

<p>Even if the building itself was painted gray, I think that you could add just a little bit of variance in value in here, and that would help a lot to feel the light wrapping around. If this was completely a gray, cloudy day, there would be very soft shadows from the building onto the ground and from the ground onto the building that would have a change and a fall-off from the soft light.</p>

<p>When you have direct sunlight, that still happens from the cool of the sky. So what I've done here is I have darkened just a little bit. Let me show you the layers of how I got here.</p>

<p>I took your painting, and then I did a <strong>curves adjustment</strong>, where I'm just kind of darkening down the brights, adding a little bit of gradient in the foreground. Then the next thing that I did was I took the background here, there's a lot of contrast on these buildings, so I'm just reducing a little bit of contrast there to give a little separation, a little bit of cool as well. I'm lifting the blues slightly and the greens slightly, so it adds just a hint of color into the shadows instead of everything looking very gray, flat, and even.</p>

<p>Then I'm adding a little bit of <strong>bloom</strong>. I took some creative liberties to say, what if some of the sunlight hit the ground? That'll give a little splash of color down there, you don't have to do that if you want light on the top of the tower. Then I have just a hair, again with an <strong>add layer</strong>, of a little bit of bloom in the top. It will put a little bit of color into the clouds, and a little bit more light onto this building.</p>

<h3>Nighttime Version</h3>

<p>For your nighttime version, this has the same feedback that I gave earlier: at night with moonlight, moonlight is not very bright, and often the <strong>blue of the sky itself will be brighter than the moonlight on the ground</strong>. So if you see mountains, if you see buildings, usually they'll be darker, and the sky will be slightly brighter.</p>

<p>This almost feels like you have some sort of light source that is extra bright off screen, you are exposed for something that is ten times brighter than the moon, which would make the sky go dark. So, in my version, I have taken the light way down to really feel like night.</p>

<p>Let me show you how I created this. I have lots of layers. So the first thing that I did was I made a <strong>curves adjustment</strong>, and this just kind of darkens everything down. You can see my curves, I've taken all of the brights way down, and then I've taken the red channel way down and the green channel down a little bit, so blue dominates the image and the whole thing is kind of dark.</p>

<p>Then I manually created a <strong>sky layer</strong> so that I could have just on the horizon a little bit of glow, like blue hour, slightly right on the edge of the horizon, so the tops of the buildings will stand out. Then one more layer to just add a little gradient, this was just a little bit flat right here. This is in <strong>multiply mode</strong>, and I just want to see a change on the street. Over here, there's a little bit more light, and then as you come around, there'll be a <strong>soft shadow</strong> from this building that will just darken slightly.</p>

<p>Then I come back to add your <strong>glow back into the windows</strong>. The first thing I did was just kind of a soft glow layer in <strong>add mode</strong>, and I made sure to not have it bleed over the foreground building. I want it to look like light that's hitting mist in the air. Then I have a second layer that is the actual direct light from the windows.</p>

<p>Then I'm thinking about light that is actually <strong>spilling from the windows and from the fog onto the building</strong> itself. So these little highlights, very, very subtle difference here with this extra glow light, but this will look like direct light that is hitting from the window onto the architecture, and that's the believability of that light source.</p>

<p>Lastly, if we wanted to bring moonlight back into this, I added some kind of backlight from screen right. So your original has light coming from screen right, but in this one, I just graze it along the edge to catch some little highlights on the top of these domes and a little bit of <strong>cast shadow</strong> here where you can kind of see there's a little bit of moonlight, but it's not everywhere. A little bit on the ground down here as well, kind of like what we did with the sun, just to make it feel like night.</p>

<h3>Foggy Version</h3>

<p>Your foggy version with these light sources too, I thought maybe we could make it just a little bit more moody. So I did another <strong>curves adjustment</strong> and just kind of darkened everything, added a little bit more gradient in the foreground for that soft ambient occlusion, and then added a little bit of <strong>glow back into the windows</strong> so we can see the effect. It's almost like a little bit later in the day, and the fog just kind of darkens a little bit more.</p>

<p>I think that if we were exposed for daylight like this, probably these light sources wouldn't be visible, it wouldn't be glowing because it's too bright in the day. No light source during daylight can compete with the sun in most photography, or it is very rare. So if we make it a little bit darker, then those light sources can stand out a little bit more believably. But I like the mood of this.</p>

<h3>Godzilla Scene</h3>

<p>Finally, your fantastic Godzilla. This is what I did with this. I wanted to <strong>draw attention away from down here and up towards Godzilla</strong>. Let me show you my layers that I did here.</p>

<p>I started with adding more <strong>gradient on the bottom</strong>, so that soft shadowing, and then it'll draw my eye upwards. Then I did another <strong>darken pass</strong> to maybe create some soft shadow from these trees onto the building. Again, I want to draw my eye up because the focal point is different on this one.</p>

<p>Then I did a <strong>curves adjustment</strong>, similar to what I did on the first, where I just lifted the blacks a little, so that I could feel like this destruction that's happening behind the building is making just a little bit of dust. It's also separating the layers, the darks in these windows is not even to the dark back here, so it's just simplifying contrast a little bit.</p>

<p>Lastly, I have a <strong>glow layer</strong> to draw extra attention to Godzilla and to the clouds, and just a little bit of like he's so high up in the air, he's catching a little bit of sun that is not really visible down in the city.</p>

<h2>Closing Thoughts</h2>

<p>That is the last bit of feedback. Thank you all for giving this a try. I hope you learned some new things. I was really excited to see your work. Continue this. Keep creating, keep trying new things, keep that curiosity for light, and you'll go really far.</p>
