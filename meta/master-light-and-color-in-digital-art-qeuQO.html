<h2>Preparing the Base for Color</h2>

<p>I've merged all my layers to simplify my base. Now, it's time to bring in the color.</p>

<h2>Applying Local Colors</h2>

<h3>Coloring the Skin</h3>

<p>First, I select the skin. It's not a perfect selection, but I can clean it up later. I use the <strong>color layer mode</strong> and choose a skin color. It's too saturated at first, but I adjust the intensity to keep the value structure intact.</p>

<h3>Coloring the Hair</h3>

<p>Next, I select the hair using the lasso tool. Holding <strong>alt</strong> lets me select straight lines easily. I decide on a blue color for the hair to create a warm-cool contrast. Again, I use the <strong>color layer mode</strong> and adjust the saturation. I experiment with different layer modes like <strong>multiply</strong>, <strong>overlay</strong>, and even <strong>vivid light</strong> to see which effect I prefer.</p>

<h2>Adding Color Variations</h2>

<p>To make the skin feel less flat, I introduce some color variation. On a new <strong>multiply layer</strong>, I add reds to the ears and nose and a bit of yellow to the forehead. I might overdo it initially, but I can always dial it back by adjusting the layer's opacity. Adding cooler tones to the shadows creates more contrast against the warmth of the face.</p>

<p>I repeat this process with the hair, adding some red to the back on a <strong>multiply layer</strong> to create an ombre effect. It's all about experimenting and seeing what looks interesting.</p>

<h2>Refining the Painting</h2>

<p>After merging the layers, I continue painting, focusing on lights and darks. I use the smudge tool sparingly to avoid making things muddy. I prefer to have my values more defined before blending.</p>

<h2>Adding Specular Highlights</h2>

<p>Now, I start adding specular highlights using a <strong>screen layer mode</strong>. These highlights emphasize the shininess of areas where light reflects more intensely. For example, adding a highlight to the eyelid instantly makes it look shiny. I consider the planes of the face that catch light similarly, like the eyelids, nose, and lips. It's important to keep the underlying form in mind so the highlights make sense.</p>

<h2>Incorporating Rim Light</h2>

<p>I block in the rim light to enhance the lighting effect. By understanding the forms of the face, I can apply the light appropriately, ensuring it follows the contours rather than just being a straight line down the edge.</p>

<h2>Utilizing Subsurface Scattering</h2>

<p>To capture the effect of subsurface scattering, I use a <strong>color dodge layer</strong>. I add saturated reds to areas where light passes through thin skin, like the nostrils and edges of the face. This creates a glowy effect that adds realism.</p>

<p>I remember that surfaces hit by light can reflect color onto nearby areas. For instance, the neck illuminated by the rim light can cast a subtle glow onto the underside of the chin. I use a saturated color rather than pure white to reflect this.</p>

<h2>Final Touches</h2>

<p>I merge the layers again and continue refining. I might add subtle skin textures like freckles or beauty spots using a <strong>multiply layer</strong>. Adjusting the opacity helps me control how prominent these details are. </p>

<p>As I refine, I constantly check the overall composition, ensuring the colors and values work together. It's a balance of experimenting and making adjustments to bring the portrait to life.</p>
