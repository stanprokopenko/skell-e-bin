<h2>The Importance of Value Scales</h2>

<p>Your first values project is to make a value scale. Value scales teach you how to control the mediums you work with. They also teach you patience. If you can't produce an exact value in a simple value scale, you can't expect to do it in a complex portrait drawing.</p>

<p>It's a good idea to make a value scale for every medium you want to get good at, whether it's markers, ink, or charcoal. Even when you start painting, it's common for students to spend weeks focusing on color charts to explore what's possible with the pigments you have.</p>

<p>For those of you who have been going through this course digitally, I encourage you to try this one with a pencil.</p>

<h2>Level 1: Creating an 11-Step Value Scale</h2>

<p>Start by drawing a 1x11-inch rectangle, and divide it into 11 squares. Feel free to use a ruler. Draw these lines very lightly because we don't want dark lines between each square, that makes it harder to compare the neighboring values.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that your pencils might not get you to a pure black. So, it's a good idea to establish your darkest possible value first. That's your <strong>value zero</strong>. The other end is defined by the white of the paper, so you don't have to do anything in that square. This defines your full range.</p>

<p>Then, fill in all the squares in between. You can start at one end and do them one by one, or start in the middle and jump around. It's completely up to you.</p>

<p><strong>Tips for Using Pencils</strong></p>

<p>Having a range of pencils can be very handy. If you're working with just a 2B, it's going to be tough to get that darkest value without pushing too hard on the paper. The lightest values will require a really soft touch.</p>

<p>Earlier in the course, I suggested working with a <strong>2H, HB, 2B, 4B, and 6B</strong>. This will make it much easier, because each pencil has a comfortable range. It is possible to do this with fewer pencils like an HB and a 6B, it just requires better control of your pencil.</p>

<p>Either way, you'll probably need to revisit and adjust some squares to ensure the values progress consistently. It's a good idea to err on the side of being too light at first because it's easier to darken than to lighten. If you have to lighten, blotting with a kneaded eraser can work.</p>

<p>Remember the clean shading warm-up. You want to avoid holes and inconsistent patches of light and dark. Make it as clean as possible without blending tools. Squinting at your value scale will help you blur the values together and make it easier to see where the jumps in value are too extreme or where the values are too similar.</p>

<p><strong>Starting Simpler</strong></p>

<p>If you want to start a little bit easier, you can do just <strong>five squares</strong>. Start with the extremes, then do the middle, and then the two between those. Having only five squares makes it much easier because the jump in value is more significant, so the subtlety isn't as important. There's a bigger margin of error. Then you can move on to doing eight squares, and then eleven.</p>

<h2>Level 2: Creating Blind Value Scales</h2>

<p>To make this more challenging, you're going to be doing <strong>blind value scales</strong>. No, you're not putting on a blindfold, you do need to see your values. You're going to do each square without seeing any of the other ones. Yes, it sounds hard, and it is hard.</p>

<p><strong>How to Do It</strong></p>

<p>You can adjust your level of difficulty with the number of squares. Doing five blind squares is much easier than doing eleven. Start by cutting one or two-inch squares. Number each one on the back. You can do them in a specific order that feels most comfortable to you or do them randomly for an even bigger challenge, if you're ready for a Level Three!</p>

<p>As you finish each one, turn them upside down so you can't see them. Once you're done with them all, line them up and see how smooth the gradation is. This is like a game and can be really fun.</p>

<h2>Optional: Value Scales with Markers</h2>

<p>This part is optional. If you bought markers when I mentioned them earlier in the course, you might want to try this. I have an OLO set of cool gray markers: 1, 3, 5, 7, and black. Counting the white of the paper, that's six pre-made values right out of the box.</p>

<p>However, applying the markers evenly on each square takes practice. Just like with pencil, if you overlap them inconsistently, you can create striations. Adding more layers with the same marker will make it darker and darker.</p>

<p><strong>Tips for Using Markers</strong></p>

<p>Applying each marker consistently to create a smooth value scale is a challenge. You have to practice applying your strokes evenly.</p>

<p>Also, just because you have five markers doesn't mean you have to do a six-value scale. To make in-between values, you can darken by layering the same marker multiple times, and you can combine multiple markers. You can add a CG1 to a CG5 to potentially make a CG6. This might take a few tries of experimenting, but that could be fun.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, with markers, to see the true value, you might need to wait a few minutes for it to dry. Water, even without any pigment, will make paper look darker, but just temporarily until it dries. This is the reality of working with water-based pigments.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p>I'm not going to be doing any demos of this project. I think most of the value will come from your mileage practicing this.</p>

<p>I know that these value scales might not seem very useful at first, and you might want to rush through the project. But try to approach these with patience and take pride in your work. Just like how practicing good line quality pays dividends in the end, so does practicing clean and accurate values.</p>

<p>So go ahead, post your value scales for critiques. And please, please make sure you take good photos. If there was ever a time for you to learn how to take evenly lit, high-quality photos, this is the time. As we go into the shading portion of the course, how you light your work will affect the values in your photos.</p>

<p>Thanks everyone. See you next time.</p>
