<h2>Using Tubes in Profile</h2>

<p>You can keep drawing the torso as a <strong>tube</strong>, but it may begin to <strong>snake and curve</strong> when the figure leans forward or backward. That creates a <strong>wave action</strong> through the ribcage and pelvis. You can still:

- Sketch a simple cylinder for the upper body.

- Let it bend into a curve if the torso leans forward or back.

- Add or subtract volume to match the figure’s changing silhouette.</p>

<p>If it helps, extend that tube into the neck area or let it overlap the pelvis. Sometimes you’ll lean on a bottle-like shape rather than a plain cylinder, especially when the ribcage or hips bulge outward.</p>

<h2>Boxes, Eggs, and Mashups</h2>

<p>Besides tubes, you can build the torso from <strong>bulging boxes</strong>, <strong>eggs</strong>, or a <strong>mashup</strong> of different forms. For instance:<br />

- <strong>Bulging boxes</strong> give clear structure but can be trickier to shape in extreme poses.<br />

- <strong>Eggs</strong> or <strong>ovals</strong> are smooth and work well for rounded areas like hips.<br />

- <strong>Mashups</strong> let you use any combination, egg for the hips, box for the ribcage, tube for the waist, etc.</p>

<p>Always check relationships: front vs. back, arm vs. ribcage, stretch vs. pinch. Change your forms when a shape no longer feels right for the pose.</p>

<h2>The Beanbag Approach</h2>

<p>A <strong>beanbag</strong> is like two or more balls connected by a soft “sock” of skin and tissue. This gives a clear idea of curving forms in the torso, especially in profile. One side <strong>stretches</strong>, and the other side <strong>pinches</strong>.  <br />

- If the stomach stretches down, the lower back pinches.<br />

- If the torso rears up, the front pinches, and the back stretches.  </p>

<p>You see this in varied poses and famous sculptures like the <strong>Belvedere Torso</strong>. Think of it as two or more bulging shapes that press together on one side and pull apart on the other.</p>

<h2>Practicing Profiles</h2>

<p>You might:

- Start with a <strong>simple profile</strong>, a smooth outer curve for the stretched side and overlapping lines on the pinched side.

- Switch to <strong>the beanbag</strong> when you need clearer separation of ribcage and hips.<br />

- Use a <strong>tube</strong> or <strong>box</strong> where you want extra clarity or a more mechanical edge.  </p>

<p>You can keep layering: form a beanbag for the torso, then blend an egg for the hips or a bulging box for the ribcage. Each approach helps you see how forms relate and overlap.</p>

<h2>Combining Strategies</h2>

<p>Try building the torso multiple ways:

1. <strong>Tube first</strong>, then add egg forms for hips or neck if you need extra bulge.<br />

2. <strong>Boxes or rectangles</strong> for a trunk-like structure, especially in a two-dimensional plan.<br />

3. <strong>Beanbags</strong> for quick pinches and stretches.  </p>

<p>Moving back and forth between these concepts makes your drawings more flexible. You can tackle subtle poses by switching tools, such as tube, beanbag, or box, whenever one feels more natural for the shape you see.</p>

<p>Focus on capturing the <strong>flow of the torso</strong> and how that flow shifts from one form to the next. Each new pinch or twist can introduce a <strong>fresh beanbag</strong> or <strong>bulge</strong> to help you see the figure in a dynamic, interconnected way.</p>
