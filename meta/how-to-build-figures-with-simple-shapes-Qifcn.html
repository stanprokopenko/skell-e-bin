<h2>Setting My Goals</h2>

<p>I like to <strong>stack multiple tasks</strong> whenever I draw or paint. I have goals around <strong>craft, concept, and aesthetics</strong>. In this example, I’m focusing on:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Connective strategies</strong> (like curves and corners, beanbags and drumsticks)  </li>

<li><strong>Simple mashup of forms</strong> (balls, boxes, tubes)  </li>

<li><strong>Mark making</strong> (clean, beautiful lines)  </li>

<li><strong>Shape design</strong> (strong, clear silhouettes)</li>

</ul>

<p>These goals give me something to measure my success by. Sometimes I focus on just one or two, other times I stack them all.</p>

<h2>Laying Out the Torso</h2>

<p>I often start with a <strong>T for the shoulders</strong>. I’ll compare that T to a vertical, compare the top of the torso to a horizontal, and so on. Each new line I add, I compare to what came before. That helps everything line up accurately.</p>

<p>I usually block in an <strong>egg shape for the rib cage</strong>. I’m not worried if it’s exactly anatomical. Sometimes I trim the top of this egg to suggest the shoulder girdle. If I need to, I’ll add another egg for the back side of the rib cage or go for a simple two-dimensional shape. As I work, I keep adjusting proportions. It’s a <strong>best guess</strong> approach, refined as I go.</p>

<h2>Adjusting Overlaps</h2>

<p>When there’s an <strong>overlap</strong>, such as an arm covering part of the hip, I want to see the full structure underneath. In a real class, I might shift my head to peek around the model to understand the hidden shape. Then when I sit back down, I can draw both sides of that form and let the arm overlap it as needed.</p>

<h2>Refining My Beanbag</h2>

<p>My initial torso block-in often looks like a <strong>beanbag</strong> with two egg shapes. As I refine, I make it <strong>less generic</strong>, adding slight stomach forms or landmarks like the <strong>belly button</strong>. Each new element I add, I compare to what’s already there. If I need more clarity, I’ll dust back my lines to avoid confusion and then firm up the improved shapes.</p>

<h2>Secondary Forms</h2>

<p>Once the big shapes are placed, I can add smaller shapes if needed. For example, I might see a <strong>latissimus</strong> shape here or a hint of another muscle there. I often treat them as <strong>miniature eggs</strong> or other simple shapes. This approach stays <strong>shape-based</strong> instead of going straight into detailed anatomy.</p>

<h2>Linking to Rendering</h2>

<p>Constructing the shapes well now makes it <strong>easier to render them</strong> later. If I think of a shoulder as an egg, I can practice rendering an egg in isolation. Then I know how to add tone and light in my final drawing. This process gives me a clear mental model of the forms before I shade them.</p>

<h2>Next Steps</h2>

<p>That’s how I block in the torso with simple shapes. Next, I’ll work on <strong>attaching the legs to the torso</strong> so I can move toward a complete pose. After that, we’ll look at how to light and render these forms. I’m excited to take the next step in building our figure drawings. See you soon!</p>
