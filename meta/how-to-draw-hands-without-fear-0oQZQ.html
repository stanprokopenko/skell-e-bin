<h2>Welcome to Hand Week</h2>

<p>Welcome back. It's hand week, the horror, the fear, the panic. But it shouldn't be. We've drawn lots of hands now, and let's draw some more. We'll crunch some fingers in, find out what makes the hand so powerful and elegant, and how it is really <strong>a figure in itself</strong>.</p>

<p>We'll draw emotional hands, angry hands, for instance. We'll get into the knuckle department, explore why the middle finger is the longest, and understand what it's all about. We'll draw creepy hands and prove that the hand has <strong>the emotion of a figure</strong>.</p>

<p>Let's take that fear away. Let's get some hands in, learn to love them, and by the end of this you will want to keep on drawing hands. But we've got to get back to the figure. We'll bring it up by drawing <strong>a head from imagination</strong>, imagine that. The power to do that is the wonder of the ages. Show it to your friends, be the life of the party.</p>

<p>And don't forget those <strong>tangents</strong>. We're going to kill some. The tangent killer is back in town, and it's me and it's you. Let's never let those tangents off the hook.</p>

<p>Good luck. Let's get into it.</p>

<h2>Simplifying the Hand</h2>

<p>There's no getting away from it, it's hand week. So let's get into it. The idea is to <strong>keep it as simple as possible</strong>. I love the connection to the hand, it gives me that idea.</p>

<h3>Starting with the Arm</h3>

<p>That big sweep of the <strong>brachioradialis</strong> down to the blade of the <strong>radius</strong> helps me connect the hand. The way we've put this course together has made you automatically aware of those moments from previous drawings.</p>

<p>We have the <strong>flexors on the inside</strong> and the <strong>extensors on the top</strong> to get us down to this hand. Then we <strong>bulge the hand out</strong>. You've often seen me draw the hand as a continuation of a hinge-like joint to the arm and then bulge it out on the sides. In my opinion, that's the best way to do it.</p>

<p>Remember, we do have to make it thicker, especially at the thumb, the <strong>thenar eminence</strong>.</p>

<h3>The Thenar Eminence and Interosseous Muscle</h3>

<p>When the hands close, the first <strong>interosseous muscle</strong> between the thumb and the fingers bulges into a new shape. So this hand is coming at us, and hands foreshorten very quickly when they come at you. There's practically no view of the top of the hand here from this foreshortened view.</p>

<h2>Understanding Hand Anatomy</h2>

<p>There are many ways to think of the hand. I think of simpler things, like legs, for instance.</p>

<h3>Fingers as Legs</h3>

<p>I often think of the fingers coming out from the <strong>metacarpals</strong>, which are the top of the hand, as like the lower leg hinging from the femur on the patella, your knee joint, and pulling down. Because the big curve that we see on the knuckles, think of the punching knuckles of a boxer, are the metacarpals. The rest is a tube that rocks back and forth on that bone.</p>

<p>From straight ahead like this, we see a step-down to that tube that fits in. It's starting to pull down.</p>

<p>Now, this looks like thigh and legs. You can think of it like that, once you get beyond that point. The actual pulled-on motion of it is much like the kneecap. You continue that idea down to the next joint. So they're basically <strong>one joint rocking on another</strong>, like a spool.</p>

<h3>Knuckle Sizes and Finger Lengths</h3>

<p>The knuckles are different sizes. The main big knuckle is the middle finger, and then they go down in size to the point where the little finger knuckle is sometimes almost non-existent.</p>

<p>They all peak with the little finger having the broadest pull-out and the longest pull-out too, because it shares that metacarpal with the ring finger. Sometimes the little finger can look like it's taking up more volume, but the peak is lower, there's no doubt about that, peak from the third finger across.</p>

<h2>Drawing the Hand from Different Angles</h2>

<p>When they're all coming out like this, they are much shorter looking. They often look weird until you put some tone in. You see I've toned underneath the knuckles and left the highlights for the top of the fingers and for the top of the hand.</p>

<h3>Adding Tone and Shadows</h3>

<p>We have it down on the page now. Let's play some more with the idea of those joints turning and pulling off of that knuckle that came first. They're basically pulled on, like a loop system on the previous knuckle. They slide, let's think of it as sliding.</p>

<p>They slide down. Now, as they come at us, remember you're looking at a dimensional thing. <strong>Curve up to show that perspective</strong> and then you're curving down at the bottom to show perspective of the finger going in.</p>

<h3>Observing Natural Finger Movement</h3>

<p>Now, that first finger there, the phalange at the end, was pulled in too much. When you pull in that much, the other fingers have to follow a little bit. So you can't pull in one really tight and have the other ones relaxed unless you do it deliberately. It has to be a very conscious effort for you to pull one finger tightly in.</p>

<p>When you're not thinking about it, it's more natural that they all pull in. So <strong>watch the natural rhythm of your hand</strong>. As you close it, the little finger closes first, then the ring finger, longest finger, index finger, and then the thumb folds in afterwards. That's the rhythm of it.</p>

<p><strong>The little finger should always be the first curl</strong>, closing the hand. And then, when opening the hand, it should be the index finger after the thumb pulls away to release those fingers back in the reverse sequence.</p>

<p>Once you learn all that stuff, you can see that you can draw a hand from imagination, closing up into what would eventually be a fist if you wanted it to. But for now, that's a gnarly, scary hand, the hand of the crypt keeper coming at you.</p>

<h3>Tendons and Knuckles</h3>

<p>Like I say, when the tendons pull over, they tend to <strong>square the knuckle ends off</strong>. So the first call here is very simple, it's all curves. The second call is straights. You really see the fingers inserted in there, below the high ridge of the knuckle.</p>

<p>In paintings, it always looks terrific when you start to see the light and darks of these ridges. And you can play with them as much as you like to make them interesting. This is a spooky light from underneath.</p>

<h2>Techniques for Drawing Fingers and Knuckles</h2>

<p>Think of the <strong>carpals</strong> first and make your way down to the thumb. See how much you can pull this and push it.</p>

<h3>Side Perspectives and Curves</h3>

<p>Take note here that the little finger is starting to show the <strong>side perspective</strong>, and so that's a different shape. The two fingers facing us are coming at us, and then the index finger is showing its side shape too. So the sides are more curved, the underneath is more curved, you see them from the side. From the front, everything is pretty boxy.</p>

<h3>Using Pentimento</h3>

<p>I'm playing and pushing this until it breaks. There's the idea of <strong>thumb, two, three</strong>, to get the longest finger in case you get confused. And then pushing those knuckles out.</p>

<p>The index finger comes out, and the knuckle will pull around with it. So you have to make sure you add that little bump as you go.</p>

<p>So there you go. Copy along. Try that on. Very difficult, but a great little mind game to play, a little puzzle to work with and <strong>power up that hippocampus</strong>. Make it stronger and prevent any cognitive decline.</p>

<p>Obviously, it's a very slow process. The less you use your brain for puzzles, the sooner we start forgetting all that stuff. So <strong>keep it keen</strong>. Keep on drawing. <strong>Puzzle out these fingers and hands</strong>. That'll keep your mind keen. Take my word on that.</p>

<h3>Importance of Starting Early</h3>

<p>I saw an artist say how they lamented leaving drawing the hands too late because it really hurt them as it was much harder to understand them later. And they had to really get an intensive course in there to do that.</p>

<p>I did the same thing. All of us did. The hands were just too difficult to try and understand, so we just copied them as best we could. But you can understand them. That little <strong>1-2-3</strong> is quick enough. And on the thumb there, it just pushes up beyond the first knuckle as a height, halfway to the first phalange that we see. So close your own thumb against your hand and see where it rests.</p>

<p>But remember the <strong>fan idea</strong> I just talked about here, how the fingers fan in.</p>

<h3>Drawing a Closed Fist</h3>

<p>So on a little closed fist like this, this is a woman's fist where little knuckles show. Of course, a baby, practically nothing, sometimes just dimples. But we're drawing women here, and so that's what we're thinking of.</p>

<p>Now, as the thumb closes from this angle, that first interosseous muscle will swell. So <strong>think of the puff between the thumb and the hand</strong>, much like the pectoralis puff on the ribcage that we see when the breasts come compressed and the arm compresses against the body. And then you see that little puff.</p>

<p>Here's a <strong>one, two, three, four</strong>. So just count it down and put a little curve at the top to show that there's skin as well pulling across these joints as you fan them in and out. Otherwise, our skin would split if it was too tight.</p>

<p>Like I say, not much in the knuckle department for women, but they can be as they get older. A really old woman will have very pronounced knuckles. You've seen that in old people's homes, you see their knuckles pushing right out and the skin so thin, almost like crepe.</p>

<p>So the more knuckle we show, <strong>the older the character appears to be</strong>. Which is terrific because that's great intel for us to draw gnarly fingers for good reasons, the aged sorceress, the wicked witch of the West.</p>

<h3>Observing Finger Alignment</h3>

<p>Here, our fingers close together, and what happens with the longest finger is that the skin fans out with the other fingers around it. So the middle finger is the big player in how to plot your fingers out. So always go to it to find out where it is. <strong>Make it the longest</strong> in particular poses like this.</p>

<p>Remember, if a finger like that little finger is going away from us, it'll get shorter in perspective. And other fingers coming at us will get shorter too. And if the middle finger comes at us, then the other fingers are going to be longer than it in perspective, like we're seeing here.</p>

<p>Now I've changed it, so <strong>one, two, three, little finger</strong> as I go along, I'm always pointing that out. And oh yeah, when the hand closes like that, the <strong>thumb comes down to meet the fingertips</strong>. So you're shortening the distance all the time between fingers and thumb as you curl the hand in. Otherwise, we wouldn't be able to pinch our finger and thumb together.</p>

<p>And it's because of that articulation of the thumb, we can do that. It's in a different place. If the thumb didn't have that pronation and all of those <strong>pollicis</strong> tendons to pull inwards, then it would just be like the other fingers, it would go nowhere but forward and backward.</p>

<h3>Interosseous Muscles and Finger Movement</h3>

<p>You can widen the fingers out, you can fan them out. There's <strong>interosseous muscles</strong> between the fingers, just like you have between the thumb and the hand. That's all they do. But they're not actually inside the fingers, they're on the sides of the knuckles. So no muscles in the fingers, it's all tendons from the knuckle downwards. And that gives us terrific <strong>range of motion</strong> in there because there's nothing interfering with those joints. <strong>You can get great gesture in a hand</strong>.</p>

<h3>Simplifying Finger Shapes</h3>

<p>You can see here I'm trying to treat them as less complicated, so there's just basically a baton of a sort with a spoon end to it. You can think of an old German hand grenade right there and then put a spoon on the end of it.</p>

<p>But look at the carpals on the top there. And then the metacarpals have a secondary ramp to them that's very smooth, hardly noticeable until you look further. And I'll just put it in there for your enjoyment and entertainment and education.</p>

<p>It is a beautiful thing once you see it. Beautiful joint movement here as we get to the metacarpals and then pushed on to the fingers. And this is almost an extended hand, so I just think of <strong>one, two</strong> to the next joint, and then add the third joint last.</p>

<p>The <strong>thenar eminence goes behind the phalanges of the thumb</strong>, very important that. So there is lots of dimension in the hand that we have to think about. Like that thumb, that's an <strong>adductor tendon</strong> that's coming from the front of the hand, actually. There is crossover there. It's all part of that rotation system of the radius. It's all about the radius bone in the thumb, that's how we get that amazing articulation.</p>

<h3>Simplifying with Sticks and Curves</h3>

<p>Sure, it makes drawing hands very tricky, but let's see if we can simplify them. Here's some sticks for you, <strong>straight on the top, more curved on the underside</strong>. Do them in sequence, <strong>straight, straight, straight, curve, curve, curve</strong>. That's a nice little rhythm. It stops you from getting bogged down in one finger after another, in all its detail.</p>

<p>Now I can start putting the webbing in and whatever else I like. So little sticks are a pretty good start on a hand and easy to do.</p>

<p>So I find the net as I go. We're not seeing the thumb here, it's hidden around the back, which can look weird sometimes, but at times that's what there is. So if I ever can, I put the thumb in just as a little notation to show it's there, and if it looks weird like a lump, then I'll not bother with it. And from this angle, it would look like a lump. I'd have to pull it all the way out.</p>

<h3>Keeping It Simple</h3>

<p>So that's very simple, isn't it? <strong>You don't have to take it further than that</strong>. Remember that. Stick, stick, stick. And for underneath, curve stick, curve stick. And you'll soon get into this rhythm.</p>

<p>So there's the <strong>carpal ramp</strong> at the top, and there's the pad in, and in go the fingers. And you can do them as broken sticks now, <strong>one, two, one, two, one, two</strong>, and off you go.</p>

<p>I made the longest finger a little longer. I'm remembering that <strong>1-2-3 to the longest</strong>. There's a little finger one phalange shorter than the ring finger, and the long finger is one fingernail longer than the other two. The other two fingers, sometimes one is shorter than the other. But play them as the same to begin with, and then do what you like for the aesthetics.</p>

<p>You can see I'm <strong>pentimento-ing</strong> that ramp. I want to push that Renaissance egg to its limit to get that beautiful flow.</p>

<p>So there you go, <strong>three hands in a row</strong> there. Always <strong>add a page of hands in your repertoire as you go</strong>. If you run out of ideas for the figure, dynamic figure drawing, just spend the day drawing hands.</p>

<h2>Drawing a Profile for Practice</h2>

<p>If hands are getting to you, "I can't do another hand, it's crazy," go and <strong>do something you know well</strong>. I'm just putting in very quickly here all the moments that make drawing a profile so easy for me.</p>

<h3>Steps to Draw a Profile</h3>

<p>Copy this over and over and look how easy it is to draw a profile, and how beautiful we can get that nose. The nose, you can do anything you want with once it's in there as a triangle. I'm doing a very delicate bridge there, and a little push up for the female nose. It doesn't have to be that, but it reads very feminine straight off the bat. It can be many different things. Sophia Loren's nose points downwards, and I cite her as the most wonderful model for femininity, whatever you want it to be.</p>

<p>Push that ear back at an angle. It helps make everything more fluid. Ears can come up pretty straight, but I like to follow it past the jawbone. The jawbone comes up at an angle, and following it with the angle of the ear doing the same thing is a nice touch. Remember, the ears are <strong>behind the jaw</strong>, otherwise, they would wiggle. And the reason some people can wiggle their ears is because they're very tight to the jaw, with a lot of flesh. But they can't really be in front of the jaw because the jaw borders the auditory crevice that we hear out of, the concha. So it can't really be in front.</p>

<h3>Adding Hair and Features</h3>

<p>Always hide the back there, so it's nice to just cloud around there in the hair. And there's me turning nouns into verbs again. But I like the idea of the hair being clouds. It's nice and gestural.</p>

<p>Then push that cheek in. You can pull that cheek around for plumpness, and notice that <strong>top lip comes down at quite an angle</strong>, and then the bottom lip is quite straight in comparison. Once again, lips can do anything, a bottom lip can protrude beyond a top lip, but the basic model is the top lip pushes out further from that muzzle generally. I've seen lips do all kinds of things, but that's the idea.</p>

<p>So the nose comes down, the nostril usually lines up with the eyelash, and the mouth, the little puff of it, it's called the <strong>node</strong>, usually lines up with the eyeball coming forward. Some people have small mouths, long mouths, and wide mouths. If you drew some plumb lines down, that is how you would work it out.</p>

<h3>Personification in Drawing</h3>

<p>Disney was great, they would <strong>personify</strong> even a train to be almost like a person. A great example is <em>The Little Engine That Could</em>. And as it tried to go up the mountain, I think that was the title, it would go in its puffing sound, "I think I can, I think I can, I think I can." When it gets to the top, it really strains. And then, as it goes over the ridge, it says, "I knew I could, I thought I could, I knew I could." Something along those lines.</p>

<p>So <strong>personification is a great mnemonic tool</strong>, a great way to bring things alive.</p>

<h2>Personifying the Fingers</h2>

<p>So these fingers, you can think of those fingers as <strong>running feet</strong>, running legs. See that? And that will take some of the mystery out of fingers. Nature repeats itself, and it has a success. So we are constantly repeating what's working on the top, near the bottom. The arms are just like the legs, they have <strong>biceps</strong> and they have <strong>extensors and flexors</strong>. So it's just another road on to get the same thing again, more powerfully, of course. The legs are incredibly powerful.</p>

<p>Try these hands from every angle and note that very angular nature of the thumb. Now, the finger, the index finger, will come away from the body of the hand. It will articulate itself usually differently than the other fingers because it <strong>points</strong>. It's a pointing finger. So I'm pushing it away from the thumb a lot. It's always dynamic to look at.</p>

<p>Then we curve around to the little finger. See how the little finger is almost at an angle sometimes compared to the other knuckles? And of course, with the fingers closing, the <strong>thumb gets closer and closer to the end of the fingers</strong>.</p>

<p>So the joints of the metacarpals swing around. So if you swing up from the index-finger metacarpal knuckle, you'll get to the thumb knuckle. And there's <strong>two phalanges</strong> from there, just like the fingers. Two phalanges for the thumb, three for the fingers.</p>

<p>But you can simplify it by thinking of the metacarpal as a third phalange with an incredibly hard and big knuckle on it. So nice little gestural hand there.</p>

<h2>The Hand as a Structural Form</h2>

<p>The hand is very structural, it's all bones. There's practically no muscle or subcutaneous fat, apart from, of course, the <strong>thenar and hypothenar eminences</strong>, and a little bit of the interosseous.</p>

<h3>Drawing Creepy Hands</h3>

<p>Now, when the hand falls down like this, certain fingers group, like three will group together, and the index finger will stay away. But if you want real creepy, you can just push those two middle fingers together and create a spider-like shape.</p>

<p><strong>I'm going to draw a very creepy hand, it's creepy hand time</strong>. So this is how I would approach a hand that's very long, very skinny, very bony, and truly terrifying, a woman's long, bony hand. Let's say this is a vampire that's 300 years old, and their hands are just hanging by their sides as they greet you at the creaky mansion door in Transylvania. We'll see all of those ramps, all of those knuckles.</p>

<h3>Elongating Proportions</h3>

<p>So you <strong>elongate one thing</strong>, you have got to elongate the other. So I've elongated the metacarpals and continued that idea all the way down to the phalanges. Remember, on a gestural hand like this, you can call the last phalange the same length as the second phalange, break it in half and then half again, and make the last half longer. So make that last half very long, and it will look great.</p>

<p>And remember now, <strong>one, two, three</strong>, get that third one in there longer, unless it's going behind, curving in. We do a little twitch across there, then they become almost the same length.</p>

<p>So a little finger pulling out. So I'll put big swathes of dark in there to get this going. One phalange shorter, but you still want it to be long. That index finger is curled in toward the body of the hand, so it appears to be almost the same length as the little finger.</p>

<p>There are all these tricks that trip you up, but as long as you put the tone in to indicate what you're doing, then people will understand what the idea is.</p>

<h3>Emphasizing Gaps and Webbing</h3>

<p>When fingers are very skinny like this, you get a <strong>gap near the knuckles</strong> for those two middle fingers. Put your fingers together and you'll see those gaps. And you can exploit that for this creepy hand that's really emaciated.</p>

<p>Just a little bit of softening back there with my finger to get another shot at drawing these digits. So nice and creepy.</p>

<h3>Using Pentimento for Effect</h3>

<p>This kind of drawing looks terrific when you use a lot of <strong>pentimento</strong> on it. Because of the structural nature of a hand, the pentimento adds a little bit of animation to it. You can imagine that the knuckles are vibrating there and turning.</p>

<p>So a little bit of <strong>wiggle wobble</strong> in there actually helps a hand look more realistic because the eye fills in all of that motion, creepiness. There it is coming at us. And with a hand like this, you can throw some of those tendons in too, which is basically a no-no on a female hand usually.</p>

<h3>Observing Skin and Webbing</h3>

<p>Feeling that swell at each knuckle and that pool of skin as the fingers come apart from each other. And then underneath is the <strong>webbing</strong>. The webbing is different. So the webbing is lower than that. You'll see <strong>two arches</strong> often.</p>

<p>And wiggle wobble all the way down there. The more you wiggle and wobble on a creepy hand like this, the better it looks. You can really get away with a lot. <strong>Get away. Get away with it</strong>. You know, you can push that to the limit and it'll only look better.</p>

<h3>Adding Details for Effect</h3>

<p>Finding that idea of those knuckles now and the scrawny nature of this hand being enhanced because there's more detail there where you wouldn't normally put it on a female hand.</p>

<p>So <strong>wibble wobble all the way</strong> and give everyone the creeps with your creepy drawings and reinforcing that the little finger goes back faster than the others, and the two opposite, the middle finger and the index finger, are pulling away at a less fast pace.</p>

<p>Okay, so with the <strong>1-2-3</strong>, the long finger is bending in towards the body, so it seems shorter. I'm just feeling those fingernails, creepy, broken.</p>

<h3>Considering Real-Life Examples</h3>

<p>As hands get broken, fingers get broken in feet and toes, they reassemble. The bone reconstitutes itself and becomes an earlier thing. So you can think for, let's say, a creature that's 150 years old. Their bones are going to have been bashed a lot. Think of all those opening and closing of those coffin doors, how many times they've nipped their fingers in there in haste with the sunlight coming. And then that bone gets broken, and it has to regrow itself back into a different shape.</p>

<p>My granddad's fingers were so gnarly from 50 years as a plasterer, working with those tools, a trowel and a hawk, and concrete walls, bashing his knuckles all over the place. Wheelbarrows crashing into bricks, I've done it myself on the building site. I grew some builder's hands, but I wasn't there long enough for it to be anything horrific. It's not a terrible sign, horrific, but they weren't a pianist's hand by the end. My hands do look like they do a little bit of work for that reason.</p>

<p>And so you see hands that have only ever done delicate work, like a pianist, for instance. You see how long and thin their fingers are, it can almost look feminine. But you certainly know a boxer's hands when you see one. And by the same token, a ballerina's feet, if you ever see them, they're like boxer's hands, bashed up at the joints.</p>

<h3>Loving to Draw Hands</h3>

<p>I remember the first time I heard someone say they <strong>love drawing hands</strong>, and I felt guilty because I didn't, and realized that the reason for that was I wasn't very good at drawing them. And that's when I started to attend to it and realize what they meant.</p>

<p>So you take that spooky hand idea on the left there and show it from a different angle, and re-exploit those moments we came to love as we were drawing that, the gap in between the middle joints up to the knuckle. So <strong>reinforce it with a quick sketch afterwards</strong>, and it will stick.</p>

<p>So <strong>be schematic when you're not too sure</strong>, rather than get lost in the weeds and bogged down in the detail. Schematic means characteristic of something but with no real detail, that's a schematic. Do a schematic, and that'll clear up your mind to do another one with more detail, and just advance like that.</p>

<h2>Taking Breaks and Refreshing the Mind</h2>

<p>Now, usually I ghost back, but you can <strong>ghost in</strong>. I'm ghosting in by using broad strokes very lightly, and it gives me the ability to draw with more confidence because there's a road map there, almost a silent road map of where I want to go. And then you can get more and more finessed with that.</p>

<h3>Drawing Gestural Hands</h3>

<p>I'm doing a big gnarly hand here, a big spell-making hand or a come-hither-here hand. A dominant hand.</p>

<p>So I want to find those joints once again as that <strong>rhythmic stick</strong>. So I put the wand shape of a curve, a <strong>fan shape</strong>, to place those knuckles in. You can see one that didn't work out too well in the center there. <strong>Ghosted hell of that</strong> all the way back so I don't want to see it anymore. So you can do that to just leave the ghost of it to remind yourself what didn't quite work there.</p>

<h3>Relaxing with Figures</h3>

<p>Every once in a while, if you get a little bit bogged down with it, go and do a <strong>little figure</strong>. Ghost, a figure in. Draw one from imagination. Just <strong>take the pressure off</strong> all of that thought process. Drawing hands is really, it's a lot of mind energy. That can be exhausting.</p>

<p>So I go in there and just play around. Ask myself where I want that leg to come out. So I had a couple of thoughts on it and then chose that. Once I have the Liberty Bell in there, I can do anything that I please.</p>

<p>So I'll just pull an arm across there. So these little drawings are just for fun, and they just relax my mind. Two arms together, a bit of a shadow underneath, and a compression of breast.</p>

<p>And that's it, that's me happy there to go and draw another hand. Those big swathes as well for the lower abs. Of course, I love to draw the hips because I know where it's going to go. You've drawn so many hips now. One of the hardest things to draw becomes one of the easiest things.</p>

<h2>Practicing and Refining</h2>

<p>Look how beautiful knees go in if you just do a broad for the cone, a broad for the ice cream, and a broad for the cone. You squint your eyes and almost realistic knees are there. They are born of just broad strokes.</p>

<p>You know how much I love that <strong>magnus adductor</strong>. I'm enjoying this little figure, taking more time than I usually do. <strong>Spoil yourself</strong>. I certainly do. I've long thrown off the shackles of pressure. Nobody's making me work faster than I want to.</p>

<p>I saw David Lynch lose his temper when a producer came up and said, "We need to do less takes," and he went crazy. He did as many takes as he needs to, to get it right. You know, we're not working by the square meter here, and we're not making potatoes, we're making art.</p>

<p>There's art and there's everything else. And <strong>art takes the time it needs to be great</strong>. You can't rush it. You can sometimes rush some strokes down just to get something that you didn't think of. That's a different thought. But generally, if you're working <strong>beyond the speed of thought</strong>, going faster, it's going to just be a train wreck.</p>

<p>You've got to <strong>really understand what you're doing every time</strong>. And that's the way to get faster. <strong>If you want to get fast, draw slowly with thought</strong>, and each drawing will get faster automatically because your thoughts are clearer and you've been here many times before.</p>

<h2>Emphasizing Hand Thickness and Structure</h2>

<p>That beautiful curve of the inside knuckles. So the pad under the fingers on the inside, that's for your knuckles. Around the other side are the knuckles.</p>

<p>You see how <strong>thick the hand is</strong> from this position. And the thumb can appear hugely big as it comes at you, more so than the fingers because they're quite thin.</p>

<h3>Adjusting Fingers and Overlaps</h3>

<p>So I didn't quite like that little finger where it was. I changed it around. As long as you're coming out from the original joint, you should be able to push that quite a lot before it just doesn't work anymore.</p>

<p>And if you push it a lot, make sure you <strong>pull some skin over the top</strong> of it too to show that you're stretching that skin as you curve it. Look at your own fingers as you pull them away from each other, you'll see that skin stretch across as a curve.</p>

<p>So the <strong>thenar eminence</strong> has taken up more of the hand than the <strong>hypo</strong>. The hypo is on the little finger side. And when it's coming at you like this, once again you're seeing the bones of the arm from underneath and the hand showing on top because of that hill of those eminences, hypo and thenar.</p>

<h3>Observing Hand Thickness</h3>

<p>So the hand is thick, especially at the palms, <strong>very thick</strong>. Hold your hand up in a profile and look at how thick that thenar eminence is, you'll be looking at your thumb. Then just turn it towards you and press your thumb in toward the hand without curving the thumb in. See how much thickness there is on that thenar eminence that I'm drawing right now.</p>

<p>A thumb coming in to show you that. So as the thumb comes toward the palm like that, the thenar really bulges.</p>

<h3>Using the Fan Shape</h3>

<p>So <strong>think of that big fan</strong>. When I put a big fan in like that, it means I'm going to spread those fingers apart. It works as a big fan like that, and that threw me off for years because everything's a little different when you do that. The fan shape is almost the same all the way around, whereas we get the fingers closer to each other, then the ring finger and the little finger drop down much faster than the other two. But here, it's a constant.</p>

<p>You see a lot of artists just drawing hands like this all the time because they're easy to draw because the fan just does the work for you.</p>

<h3>Applying the 1-2-3</h3>

<p>Still got to do <strong>1-2-3</strong> to get that longest finger, and bring it at the joints halfway. Notice there's an echo of the thenar eminence there as well with the interosseous on the top, the pad between the thumb and the fingers.</p>

<p>So there we go. That was a lot of little hands, and now the challenge is to draw a hand with more substance to it. So I'll keep it simple.</p>

<h2>Drawing a Hand with Substance</h2>

<p>We want to draw quite a <strong>big hand here, a fleshy hand</strong>. And I want it to be alive. <strong>Think of the hand as a living thing</strong>. <strong>Personify it</strong>. You can think of hands that are angry, hands that are gentle, and hands that are threatening. And that will help you draw the hand all the better.</p>

<h3>Starting with the Arm Position</h3>

<p>So notice I always draw the <strong>arm coming in toward the hand</strong> to show me position. I'm doing it here to get that position, and look at the lovely perspective of those two phalanges of the thumb to give us that wonderful dynamism.</p>

<h3>Emphasizing the Thenar Eminence</h3>

<p>So think of that big moment of the <strong>thenar eminence</strong>. You can think of it here as a mushroom if you like, with a strange protrudence from it, a mushroom shape with a stalk.</p>

<p>And look also at the <strong>webbing pulling away up toward the index finger</strong>. So that webbing actually stops just under the knuckle, but it will continue to look like there's more of it. So check your own hand, and you'll see that that webbing very suddenly stops, but sometimes there's an echo of shadow to it, which I'm showing there.</p>

<h3>Applying the 1-2-3 Again</h3>

<p>So there's <strong>one, two, three going in</strong>. One, two. And I got stuffed up a little bit there, did you see that? I was counting just the fingers. So <strong>thumb, two, three</strong>, thumb, two, three, and off you go.</p>

<p>And here we do <strong>drop down very fast for the ring finger and the little finger</strong>. The reason I dropped down so fast is because the share carpal, metacarpal, goes in there for the ring finger, takes up most of the carpal, and then the little finger has to make do with the end.</p>

<h3>Simplifying the Drawing</h3>

<p>Now that's a very difficult drawing when you're starting to just draw fingers. But look how I'm treating them, it's just <strong>one, two, three</strong> all the time for those joints. And just imagining that they're not fingers for a moment anyway, that they are just these tubes that fit into each other. And they pulled on from each other. And there is that moment where they pulled on from. So that curve, each phalange is <strong>rocking on that curve</strong>.</p>

<h3>Understanding Joint Curvature</h3>

<p>So there's the big curve from the punching knuckles, a smaller curve, and then the next phalange fits into that and rolls over it. And then the last phalange does the same thing. So each knuckle is getting <strong>less curved</strong> because the phalanges are getting smaller. So they need less curve to fit into.</p>

<p>Remember, the fingers are getting <strong>thinner as they get closer to the edge</strong> as well, just like legs. Think of the thigh down to the ankle.</p>

<p>Remember, <strong>one's in front of the other</strong>. It's very easy to draw fingers that are always apart from each other. So there's a <strong>step, step, step</strong> all the way along there.</p>

<p>And sometimes things just look weird because they just look weird. If the reason is they look short even though it's correct, just <strong>make it a little longer so that it looks right</strong>. Nobody cares what your reference was, but they'll criticize your drawing if it looks wrong even if it's accurate to the bad reference because you're a slave to it.</p>

<h3>Adjusting and Refining</h3>

<p>So I'll change, change, change. You can see a lot of <strong>pentimento</strong> there. That's very wiggly and waggly there, that little finger. That was me drawing <strong>faster than the speed of thought</strong>. And look at the trouble it got me into.</p>

<p>So there's no point in drawing fast, it just makes errors. And then you compound those errors as you try and fix them. So best to just <strong>draw a little slower, with more thought</strong>.</p>

<h3>Adding Details and Tone</h3>

<p>Notice the <strong>tops of the fingers are straight</strong>, until you get to the joints, that is, but underneath are <strong>padded</strong>, they're pads. So they are going to take all the pressure from the bones.</p>

<p>Generally, we use the <strong>palm side to push up from</strong>. Let's say in the gym you're doing press-ups. So all your weight's on those palms. When they're on the knuckles, it's quite painful, isn't it? You see people doing macho press-ups on their knuckles, but it's not the easiest way to do it. It's certainly not the smartest way.</p>

<p>There we go. Reinforcing those curves and the fingernails. Remember, they're <strong>halfway down</strong> the last phalange. You don't have to measure them, of course, that's crazy. Just be aware, that's the general idea of it.</p>

<p>So there's more <strong>ghosting back</strong> on those drawings than other drawings because they're more complicated, they need a bit more ghost to them.</p>

<h3>Taking Breaks When Necessary</h3>

<p>Now that drawing was complicated. There's more to do on it. I just feel it, and sometimes you don't even know the reason. But if you know there's something more to do, then <strong>go do another drawing and come back with a fresh eye</strong>.</p>

<h2>Dealing with Foreshortening and Overlaps</h2>

<p>So I'm over here doing a really <strong>foreshortened hand</strong> on the same page to keep my mind keen and to look around from time to time to see what else needs done on that hand.</p>

<p>Because you could consider that hand as close to maybe a finished illustration, getting close to it. You can hand that over to an inker, and they could finish it for you in ink.</p>

<h3>Understanding Knuckle Placement</h3>

<p>So there are golden knuckles. And the <strong>knuckles</strong>, the skin of the fingers can go up halfway to those knuckles. But of course, the fingers aren't going up there, the fingers are fitting into those knuckles. So I <strong>stepped down</strong> for the fingers to get them into position, for rocking back and forth. Some people can bend the last phalanges a little bit, but all the bending is going to be in, toward the body of the hand.</p>

<h3>Experimenting with Finger Positions</h3>

<p>So you can see here I can <strong>overlap fingers</strong>. I can always push the maverick sod, the index and the little finger. That will always give me some quirkiness.</p>

<p>Hands can look weird until you finish them off. <strong>Make them more finessed in their curves</strong> because they always look a bit strange. It's the finessing of tone and lines that really make a hand work. And that's why really you should just do them <strong>schematically</strong> when you're doing a quick drawing. Otherwise, you'll spend all day on them.</p>

<h3>Twisting and Articulation</h3>

<p>So there's the carpals going in for that big twist. See how much you can twist it. I'm just <strong>breaking those knuckles in half</strong> there, just to feel it.</p>

<p>Hands will look much more like hands when you're drawing a male figure because you can really go to town on those knuckles. But with a female hand, you don't want to make too much of the knuckles unless it's a witchy-poo hand.</p>

<p>So for a young woman's hand, really, you can just <strong>taper down</strong> almost from a wide to a slim and then put a fingernail on it, and that's all you need to do. You'll see that in a lot of illustration. There's practically nothing to it. Everything's on the <strong>contours of the outside of the finger</strong>.</p>

<h3>Understanding Webbing and Flesh</h3>

<p>There's a difference between <strong>webbing underneath</strong> and <strong>flesh stretching on top</strong>. It always goes back to show yourself that the hand is pretty much there. It just looks like it's not because it's line. <strong>Tone tells a different story</strong>.</p>

<h2>Simplifying Further</h2>

<p>The inside of the hand here. I loved a cartoonist called <strong>Jack Davis</strong>, and his hands were so gestural and fast you could tell how easily he drew them. So he's working with <strong>rhythms</strong> like this.</p>

<h3>Practicing with Rhythms</h3>

<p>He was very good at doing the thumb and foreshortening. His dynamic cowboys did lots of cowboys. In his time, that was what was on television all the time. It is similar to the way we've got fantasy movies today. They had westerns back then, they were the most popular form of entertainment. So he did tons and tons of westerns like that, and needed lots of hands because it was all about gun-slinging. So the stories revolved around the fast gun.</p>

<h3>Observing Natural Curvature</h3>

<p>I'm curling the hands in here. I'm doing the same thing that I do with an extended finger, just <strong>half it</strong>, half the length. But it's when you pull the fingers in like that, you really see how all of the fingers <strong>bow toward the middle finger</strong>, and that's why I put those arrows in.</p>

<p>So the middle finger is the straightest one. Let's call it the most <strong>conservative finger of the hand</strong>, and the others are folding in toward it. That's why drawing a <strong>mitten</strong> is good. So you draw a mitten, it shows you that everything's curving inwards. It's an easy thing to see.</p>

<p>And your fingers, when they push in like this, are fitting into the <strong>hypothenar eminence</strong> and the <strong>thenar eminence</strong> particularly. So fold your fingers into your hand and look at the palm and see how the hollow of the hand is made for the fingers to push into. Turn your hand around and look at that, and it's very clear.</p>

<h3>Following the Rhythms</h3>

<p>So there's the rhythms. So the thenar for the thumb is <strong>more than half of the hand</strong>, so I moved it over a little bit there. It can be very easy to make it exactly half and then it looks weird for no apparent reason until you think about it. It takes up much of the palm, and the hypo less.</p>

<p>So the thenar for the thumb, <strong>fat and short</strong>, and the hypothenar eminence for the little finger is <strong>long and boxy and thinner</strong>.</p>

<p>So we're getting good at hands now. <strong>Try them. Draw them over and over</strong>. Once you put the fingernails on, you suddenly see it's all alive again.</p>

<p>And remember the <strong>perspective</strong> too, that these are <strong>tubes</strong>. So think of how a tube comes at you, and where the curve would be. It's very easy to do the curve in the wrong position. And sometimes you don't know what the hell is wrong with it.</p>

<p>So I'll do lots of tubes and play around with the idea of tubes. Now with that ghosted peg, I can very easily go from finger to finger and <strong>finesse</strong>. Get down to the knuckles and put a curve on them each time, and finding that perspective as well. This is your chance to <strong>move things around to make them a little better</strong>.</p>

<p>Probably going a little too fast there. Some of those fingers are too fat. So I'm <strong>breaking my own rules</strong> there. Come back and say to yourself next time a little slower there to get that done.</p>

<h3>Acknowledging Imperfections</h3>

<p>I'll use my excuse that I'm demoing, and so a demo is always a much lesser drawing than drawing alone without the pressure of the camera, all that stuff and the lights.</p>

<p>I went to draw for the New Masters, and they turned all the lights on. I couldn't see a thing. And then the monitor had a big glare on it. I couldn't see a thing on that. I really started to panic. I thought, I can't do this. So I had to step back and reconfigure the way I usually draw. I usually have everything pretty close to me, reference-wise. So I had to say to the director, look, I need to move this screen in a different direction. And then we got to drawing.</p>

<h3>Correcting Mistakes</h3>

<p>So there was what was wrong with that. <strong>One, two, three</strong>. The third finger along wasn't big enough, and the rhythm was wrong because of that. So I've gone back in there with a fresh eye now and corrected that.</p>

<p>A correction is hard to do, by the way, because you're not in the flow of the drawing, and so the first marks you make can be a bit cumbersome. That first one certainly was. And also I've noticed there that that finger, the ring finger, should <strong>overlap the little finger</strong> a bit more just for design purposes. So that's what I've come back to do, to make that more gnarly, more creepy, more informed. And you see, I've shortened that because it was too long. And sometimes you have to make the other fingers a little bit bigger if you've made a change on that one, just to get things back into the realms of believability.</p>

<h3>Avoiding Tangents</h3>

<p>It's a terrible <strong>tangent</strong> with that fingernail. Sometimes there's nothing else to be done. You know, the laws of nature tell me that that finger can't be any longer. So sometimes you have to <strong>live with the tangent</strong>, and it's an awful thing to have to do that. The more components, the more that's going to happen. So a multi-figure composition, fill the tangents to fight with. And you can consider this a multi-figure composition, with the figures being the fingers and the overlaps.</p>

<p>They're not always going to land where you want them to. But we can get there with something beautiful. Remember, they're going into the palm, and so there's overlaps there too. You can see that finger is fitting into that knuckle behind it.</p>

<h3>Persevering and Refining</h3>

<p>Be very, very aware of how it works. That finger, because it was such a struggle, had to get some <strong>kneadable eraser</strong> on it. And notice, I used the dirty kneadable eraser. <strong>Ghosted back less</strong>. A clean one would have really taken a lot of it off. These newsprint drawings can't be really erased, certainly not with a hard eraser, tear the paper.</p>

<p>And that's fine. These aren't meant to be drawings that are finished. Even though you can get close to a finished drawing like this. And you could draw that again with all the motor memory in there, that you've learned. And of course, you've added now to your hippocampus, your internal art engine. And you could go into your sketchbook now, or a canvas, and start drawing this hand without copying.</p>

<p>There I'm trying to <strong>fix that tangent</strong>. Just got it there. Come on! Yes! There we go. That fingernail <strong>saved the day</strong> right there. Can I do it with the next one? Come on. There you go. Still a tangent.</p>

<p>I'm the <strong>tangent killer</strong>. I'm basically always trying to make sure there's overlaps. Because when one thing just touches another, it betrays the idea of a two-dimensional surface. It says nothing can go beyond here because it's a flat surface.</p>

<p>The <strong>illusion is in the overlaps</strong> and also the <strong>thickness of line</strong>.</p>

<h3>Observing Skin Creases</h3>

<p>When the hand bends against the flesh here, there's a lot of <strong>crepe</strong> going on at that point. With that thenar eminence webbing, you can get <strong>two strings</strong> to it. They fan out quite a bit, and if that sounds complicated, just think of it as a gift because it gives you more chance for rhythm and they make it more animated.</p>

<p>Because I can have all of those lines in there, it makes the hand feel more alive and just give them a little bit more <strong>crease</strong> there.</p>

<h3>Avoiding Hyperrealism</h3>

<p>Now, I don't draw the actual creases, you know, like you have the palm reader read your palm. I don't actually draw the lines unless they are showing a bulge or a crease. Because that's <strong>hyperrealism</strong>, and it's weird. So I don't do it.</p>

<p>But it's a good indicator if you look at your hands where the hands fold because they've obviously created those creases, just like wrinkles around the eyes when you wink. After a while, they're there permanently. Since we've used our hands from birth, always moving them, there's creases there from the get-go almost.</p>

<p>There we go. I hope that helped you. That's hand day, and it was great fun. Treat it so. <strong>Never fear hand day</strong>.</p>
