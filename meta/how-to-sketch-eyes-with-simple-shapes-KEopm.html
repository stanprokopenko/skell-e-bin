<p>In this last section of the eye chapter, I'll go over gesture drawing and a color rendering of the eyes. I want to show you my process for setting things up for success later on by having a strong foundation with the initial sketch.</p>

<h2>Starting with the Brow Line and Glabella</h2>

<p>The first thing I look at when I'm drawing the eyes is establishing the <strong>brow line</strong>. Then, I'll find the vertical line of the <strong>T of the face</strong>, which allows me to establish that <strong>keystone shape</strong>, the <strong>glabella</strong>. That's how I start drawing the eyes.</p>

<h2>Establishing the Eye Line and Tilt</h2>

<p>From the glabella, I can establish the <strong>eye line</strong>, which is about one-third the way down between the brow line and the base of the nose. One thing to focus on when drawing the eyes is the <strong>tilt</strong> of the eyes. For example, if I look closely, I can see that the left eye is actually higher up than the right eye. I want to be sure to indicate that.</p>

<p>I use a soft, light line to establish these connecting horizontal lines.</p>

<h2>Drawing the Eyebrows and Nose</h2>

<p>Once I have the brow line and eye line, I can establish the shapes of the <strong>eyebrows</strong>. From the glabella, I can pull out the <strong>nasal bone</strong> and follow the gesture of the nose. I like to follow the crease between the glabella and the nasal bone, then follow the planes along the intermedial side of the nose to find that corner where I can see the <strong>eye socket</strong> protruding out a little bit, creating a harder edge.</p>

<h2>Finding the Corners of the Eyes</h2>

<p>From there, it's easier to find the corners of the eyes in relationship to the nose. I use little dashes to indicate where the <strong>tear ducts</strong> are, the corners of the eyes, or the <strong>lacrimal caruncles</strong>. Then, I draw a straight line from the tear ducts out to the other corners of the eyes, the <strong>lateral corners</strong>. The lateral corner of the eye is usually higher up than the tear duct.</p>

<h2>Blocking Out the Eyelids</h2>

<p>I use straights to block out the side planes of the eyes. Then, I do a connecting gestural line, completing the flow from eye to eye. For me, that's super important because it helps me make sure the eyes are more symmetrical in their design and that there's a nice flow from eye to eye.</p>

<p>I block out the <strong>lower eyelids</strong> and the <strong>top eyelid</strong>. I do another connecting line, connecting those creases between the upper eyelid and the <strong>hood of the eye</strong>. You can see how the upper eyelid wraps around the sphere of the eyeball. I use curves to show that spherical form and capture the thickness of the upper eyelid.</p>

<h2>Drawing the Irises and Pupils</h2>

<p>Before we continue fleshing out the eyelids and the eyelashes, we should establish the <strong>irises</strong>. When I'm drawing the irises, sometimes it helps me focus more on the negative shape surrounding it, the shapes of the white of the eye, the <strong>sclera</strong>. That helps me map out more accurately where the iris should be in relationship to the rest of the eye.</p>

<p>I make sure the <strong>pupils</strong> are lined up. I graphically indicate any strong highlights on the upper portion of the irises. For example, they might look like square or rectangular lights if they're reflecting a window or a directional light source.</p>

<h2>Adding Value and Details</h2>

<p>At this point, I can start adding a little bit of value. The bottom plane of the upper eyelid is usually in shadow. I block in the value of the <strong>brown eyes</strong>, darken the pupils, and probably darken the iris a bit more.</p>

<p>When blocking in those <strong>eyelash shapes</strong>, I block them in as little triangular, wispy shapes instead of doing individual hairs. <strong>Clump those eyelashes together</strong>, it'll be a more appealing design if you do that.</p>

<p>I simplify the <strong>eyebrows</strong>, and maybe add some of the wrinkles of the brow to show age. I also quickly indicate shadows on the lower eyelids.</p>

<h2>Correcting Mistakes</h2>

<p>Sometimes, even after careful construction, I might notice a mistake. For example, I might need to elevate one eye to line it up better with the other. <strong>Don't be discouraged if you make the same mistake</strong>. If you can catch it early and correct it, that's something to be proud of.</p>

<p>To correct the mistake, I might use the selection tool and transform tools to adjust the position of the eye. Then, I clean up some of the construction lines.</p>

<h2>Anatomy Tips</h2>

<h3>The Glabella and Keystone Shape</h3>

<p>Remember, the <strong>glabella</strong> is the keystone shape between the eyebrows. From the glabella, you can pull out the eyebrow shapes and find the rest of the gesture of your eyes.</p>

<h3>The Hood of the Eye</h3>

<p>The meaty part above the upper eyelid is the <strong>hood of the eye</strong>.</p>

<h3>The Sclera, Iris, and Pupil</h3>

<p>The <strong>sclera</strong> is the white of the eye, though it's seldom purely white. The <strong>pupil</strong> is the little black dot in the middle, and the <strong>iris</strong> is where you have most of the color of the eye.</p>

<h3>Asymmetry in Eye Design</h3>

<p>I wanted to highlight the <strong>asymmetrical nature</strong> of the design of the eye. Typically, especially when the eyes are more at rest and looking forward, the <strong>apex of the upper eyelid</strong> favors the upper right corner, whereas the <strong>bottom point of the lower eyelid</strong> favors the bottom left. This creates a nice asymmetry and contrast between the upper and lower eyelid.</p>

<p>This is much more appealing and natural-looking than the mistake that most novice artists make, where they draw a simple almond shape where the top and bottom eyelids are almost identical. It feels very unnatural, flat, and uninteresting, so you definitely want to avoid that.</p>

<h3>Avoiding the Almond Shape</h3>

<p>Instead of the almond shape, focus on the natural asymmetry of the eyelids. Pay attention to how the lateral corner of the eye on the outside is higher up than the tear duct, which is lower.</p>

<h3>The Thickness of the Eyelids</h3>

<p>This illustration shows how much the eyelids <strong>wrap around the spherical form</strong> of the eyeball. You can really see the thickness of the top plane of the lower eyelid. Remember, you'll also see that thickness in the upper eyelid, depending on the model.</p>

<h3>Simplifying the Eyelashes</h3>

<p>When you're drawing eyelashes, try to <strong>simplify them into graphic shapes</strong> first. <strong>Clump them together</strong> into simplified shapes. Later, as you refine your rendering, you can add more detail if needed.</p>

<h2>Gesture Drawing: Second Example</h2>

<p>Let's move on to our second reference image for our gestural approach to the eyes.</p>

<h3>Starting with the Basic Shapes</h3>

<p>Again, I start off by doing a rough T to indicate the brow line and the vertical line cutting the face in half. That allows me to find the glabella, the keystone shape. From there, I can pull out the direction and shape of the eyebrows.</p>

<p>I use graphic shapes to block in the <strong>eye socket</strong>. This shape is a good place to start when quickly blocking in the eyes.</p>

<h3>Finding the Corners and Tilt</h3>

<p>I find the corners of the eyes, starting with the outer corners, the lateral corners of the eyes. I make sure those line up. The lateral corner of the eye is oriented higher up, and the tear duct is lower. You can see that with the diagonal lines that connect those dots.</p>

<h3>Blocking in the Irises</h3>

<p>With the corners established, I do a gestural horizontal line to indicate where the crease is between the upper eyelid and the hoods of the eyes. I use simple straight lines to block out the initial shape of the eyes.</p>

<p>Then, I roughly block in the irises. When I do that, I pay attention to the surrounding negative shapes, the shapes of the sclera surrounding the iris. This helps me orient the irises in the right place.</p>

<h3>Adjusting for Perspective</h3>

<p>One thing I notice is that the right eye is too wide. I need to pull it in a bit. The iris on the right is actually more of an <strong>ellipse</strong>, the perspective is pushed more. I correct the angle, and adjust the eye accordingly.</p>

<p>When you're blocking in the eyelashes, see them as more flat graphic shapes at first, instead of trying to draw each individual hair. <strong>Clump the eyelashes together</strong> for a stronger design.</p>

<h2>Profile View of the Eye</h2>

<p>Let's focus on how to approach the eye from a <strong>profile view</strong>.</p>

<h3>Drawing the Eye in Profile</h3>

<p>I start by establishing the brow line and pull out the profile of the forehead and nose. Here we have the glabella, the keystone. I pull out the shape of the eyebrow, keeping it graphic.</p>

<p>You can see that the flow of the upper eyelid follows the beginning of the base of the glabella. I indicate that, noting how the upper eyelid overlaps the right side of the hood of the eye.</p>

<h3>Understanding the Eyelid Thickness</h3>

<p>The profile view makes it easy to see the <strong>thickness of the eyelids</strong> and how much they protrude from the eyeball. The eyelids wrap around the spherical form of the eyeball, and the shapes of the eyelids have a tapered form, going from thin to thick as they fan out away from the eye.</p>

<h3>Simplifying Eyelashes from the Side</h3>

<p>From the profile, you can easily see the silhouette of the eyelashes. I block them out as a simple graphic shape, not worrying about individual hairs yet. <strong>Simplify the eyelashes into graphic shapes</strong> first, then you can break it up as needed later.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p>Remember, when drawing eyes, it is important to start with a <strong>strong foundation</strong>. Work from <strong>simple to complex</strong>, big shapes to small shapes. Use construction lines to ensure alignment and symmetry, but don't be afraid to adjust if needed. Pay attention to the anatomy, the glabella, the hood of the eye, the sclera, iris, and pupil. Focus on the natural <strong>asymmetry</strong> of the eyes, and avoid the flat almond shape.</p>

<p>Simplify details like eyelashes and eyebrows into graphic shapes first. This will lend itself to a stronger design and make your drawing more appealing.</p>

<p>In the next section, we'll move on to a full color rendering of the eyes, applying these principles in a painting.</p>
