<p>After finishing the <strong>flats</strong>, I move on to the <strong>adjustments stage</strong> of my coloring process. This is where I choose the final colors and make holistic adjustments to ensure everything reads clearly and fits within the desired color space.</p>

<h2>The Adjustments Stage</h2>

<p>In this stage, I might:</p>

<ul>

<li>Use <strong>adjustment layers</strong> for broad changes.</li>

<li>Alter specific colors for better readability.</li>

<li>Add variations, like introducing different shades of green to plants.</li>

</ul>

<p>I've been subtly adjusting colors as I choose flat colors, but now I focus on refining them. For instance, I initially made all the buildings the same color for speed. Now, I darken buildings closer to us due to <strong>atmospheric diffusion</strong>, distant objects like mountains appear lighter because of air molecules scattering light.</p>

<h2>Using Adjustment Layers</h2>

<p>Adjustment layers let me manipulate colors without altering the original layers. Since everything is organized, this process goes smoothly. I might:</p>

<ul>

<li>Make foreground elements slightly darker.</li>

<li>Adjust the greens so plants closer to the viewer are darker.</li>

<li>Add variety to plants to prevent them from looking like one type.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Considering Light Source</h2>

<p>At this point, I start thinking about the <strong>light source</strong>. I decided earlier that light comes from the left to illuminate my main character's face. With flats, I make micro-decisions to account for lighting changes, like:</p>

<ul>

<li>Making one side of a building's plants brighter.</li>

<li>Adjusting gray tones on AC units for separation.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Enhancing Contrast and Separation</h2>

<p>I look for areas needing more <strong>tonal contrast</strong>:</p>

<ul>

<li>Adjusting sidewalk colors to make elements pop.</li>

<li>Tweaking skin tones to add variety and make the main character stand out.</li>

<li>Ensuring legs and background elements have clear separation.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Masking Techniques</h2>

<p>I use masks to apply adjustments to specific areas:</p>

<ul>

<li>Masking the background to adjust it separately.</li>

<li>Using <strong>overlay</strong>, <strong>soft light</strong>, or <strong>hard light</strong> blending modes to affect overall tones.</li>

<li>Creating smoother transitions between foreground and background with airbrushed masks.</li>

</ul>

<p>By masking the foreground and background, I can:</p>

<ul>

<li>Make the background appear more blown out.</li>

<li>Darken the foreground subtly.</li>

<li>Increase saturation in the foreground for depth.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Previewing Different Color Schemes</h2>

<p>Adjustment layers allow me to experiment with different atmospheres:</p>

<ul>

<li>Warming up the scene for a cheerful look.</li>

<li>Cooling down colors for an overcast feel.</li>

<li>Quickly shifting the entire palette without altering individual elements.</li>

</ul>

<p>For example, changing the sky's color can dramatically alter the scene's mood. I can then fine-tune adjustment layers to achieve the desired effect.</p>

<h2>Refining Adjustments</h2>

<p>Sometimes, adjustments affect elements I want to keep unchanged. If an adjustment layer dulls the red of my main character's outfit, I can:</p>

<ul>

<li>Mask out the red areas from the adjustment layer.</li>

<li>Rearrange layers to limit the adjustment's impact.</li>

<li>Tweak opacity and blending modes for subtle effects.</li>

</ul>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p>The adjustments stage is all about refining colors and ensuring the artwork feels cohesive. By using adjustment layers and masks, I can make broad changes quickly and focus on enhancing the overall composition.</p>

<p>Next up, I'll be adding <strong>shadows</strong>, <strong>lighting</strong>, and <strong>highlights</strong> to bring more depth to the piece. I'll also add <strong>finishing touches</strong> like coloring lines or subtle glows, depending on what the artwork needs.</p>
