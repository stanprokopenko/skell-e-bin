<h2>What's in Premium?</h2>

<p>In the premium lesson on <strong>Understanding Weight, Balance, and Proportions in Figure Drawing</strong>, we dive into essential concepts that enhance your figure drawings. You'll learn to start with the <strong>gesture</strong> and focus on the <strong>idea</strong>, capturing the essence rather than just copying the subject.</p>

<p>We introduce <strong>weight and balance</strong>, crucial for achieving naturalistic realism. You'll explore the <strong>eight parts of the body</strong>—head, rib cage, pelvis, spine, two arms, and two legs—and understand their organization.</p>

<p>The lesson guides you through creating a <strong>proportion chart</strong>, a practical tool for mapping the figure. You'll gain insights into the structure of the <strong>rib cage and pelvis</strong>, the <strong>spine's curvature</strong>, and how these elements contribute to the body's balance.</p>

<p>Discover how <strong>asymmetry and design</strong> in the limbs add dynamism to your drawings. We discuss <strong>gender differences</strong> in proportions and their impact on the figure's character.</p>

<p>By understanding these principles, you'll improve your gesture drawings, comprehend the importance of form, and avoid common proportion errors.</p>
