<p>My name is <strong>Eric Gist</strong> (or <strong>E.M. Gist</strong>, as you'll often see me credited). Today, I'm working on the <strong>ideation</strong> or <strong>idea development phase</strong> of a comic book cover. You'll often hear this called <strong>thumbnailing</strong> because these are tiny sketches, like a thumbnail, focusing on the <strong>design problem</strong> more than anything else.</p>

<p>At this stage, I'm not too worried about drawing, anatomy, or even perspective, though there's a bit of perspective involved. Instead, I'm aiming to capture what's in my mind's eye in a very simple, <strong>three-value design</strong>. I keep coming back to <strong>design</strong> and <strong>graphic design</strong>, it's about <strong>shape dynamics</strong>, <strong>silhouette</strong>, and telling the story we're trying to tell. I'm using these silhouettes as a vehicle to tell the story, focusing on how <strong>light against dark</strong> can pop one thing in front of another, or push it behind.</p>

<h2>Setting Up the Template</h2>

<p>I'll be working in <strong>Procreate</strong>, and I already have a template for the cover. I may manipulate it a bit because they give you some freedom, especially on variant covers. They've also provided me with a <strong>character sheet</strong> to ensure we're using the correct designs, the most contemporary or modern designs from the actual book.</p>

<p>The characters have specific patterns on their costumes, which will influence the overall <strong>value breakdown</strong> or <strong>design</strong> of the image. For instance, their shoulder pieces, boots, and belts will affect how I approach the <strong>light and dark patterns</strong> in the composition. I consider all these elements as I start designing because they play a crucial role in how the characters stand out against different backgrounds.</p>

<h2>Defining the Story and Composition</h2>

<p>I start by creating a layer to draw on and select the <strong>Peppermint pencil</strong> under sketching. It's the one that feels most like a real pencil and allows me to transition into digital from my traditional background as smoothly as possible.</p>

<p>My initial idea is to <strong>exhibit the individuality of each of the Fantastic Four</strong> while also showing how they work together as a <strong>team</strong>. I want to illustrate how each member's unique personality and characteristics <strong>enhance the whole</strong>, the whole being more than the sum of its parts.</p>

<h3>Rough Perspective</h3>

<p>I don't worry too much about perspective, but I want a rough feel of what I'm working with. The image I have in my mind is kind of a <strong>three-point perspective</strong>, so I loosely get this in. One of the nice things about Procreate is that I can set up a <strong>perspective grid</strong> under the canvas settings, which is really handy.</p>

<h3>Placing the Characters</h3>

<p>I start to figure out where everyone is in the scene:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Reed Richards (Mr. Fantastic)</strong>: Up front piloting the <strong>Fantasticar</strong>. He's the leader of the family, and I want to reflect that.</li>

<li><strong>Sue Storm (Invisible Woman)</strong>: At Reed's right side in the right pontoon, symbolizing her role as his wife and partner.</li>

<li><strong>Ben Grimm (The Thing)</strong>: In the back, covering everyone's butt. I like the idea of him relaxing with his feet up, showing his laid-back personality and his large size.</li>

<li><strong>Franklin Richards</strong>: In the near-side pontoon, serving as the catalyst of the action in the piece.</li>

<li><strong>Johnny Storm (Human Torch)</strong>: Off on his own, flying alongside the Fantasticar, emphasizing his rebellious nature while still being part of the family unit.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Working with Values</h2>

<p>I keep the sketches small because I want the design to read at the smallest possible size. People might see it as a small icon on the Marvel Unlimited app, so it needs to appeal on a very simple design basis.</p>

<p>To keep things simple, I limit myself to <strong>three values</strong>:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Light Value</strong></li>

<li><strong>Medium Value</strong></li>

<li><strong>Dark Value</strong></li>

</ul>

<p>With white, this gives me <strong>four values</strong> to work with. I create little value squares in the corner of my canvas to remind me, and I use the color picker to select them as needed.</p>

<h3>Painting the Background</h3>

<p>On a new layer, I use the lightest value to paint the <strong>background buildings</strong>. I leave the top planes of the buildings white, which helps establish the perspective. I'm not getting too detailed, just enough to give the impression of a city in three-point perspective.</p>

<h3>Silhouetting the Fantasticar</h3>

<p>On another layer, I use the medium value to <strong>silhouette the entire Fantasticar</strong>. This helps it stand out against the lighter background and establishes the main shapes in the composition.</p>

<h3>Adding the Human Torch</h3>

<p>I include <strong>Johnny Storm</strong> flying around the Fantasticar, following the same direction but off on his own. This emphasizes his independent, rebellious nature while still being connected to the family.</p>

<h2>Refining the Design</h2>

<p>Now, I start to <strong>tighten up the drawing</strong> and include more storytelling elements. I move from thumbnail to a slightly more detailed sketch to provide more information and make decisions about the composition.</p>

<h3>Storytelling Elements</h3>

<ul>

<li><strong>Franklin</strong>: He's the catalyst of the action. I have him losing his ice cream cone due to Reed's crazy driving. He's open-mouthed, screaming in surprise.</li>

<li><strong>Reed Richards</strong>: Piloting the Fantasticar with one hand, while his stretchy arm reaches back to catch Franklin's ice cream cone. This shows his multitasking abilities and his role as a caring father.</li>

<li><strong>Sue Storm</strong>: She's amused by the situation, smiling as she observes her family. Her hair is blowing across her face.</li>

<li><strong>Ben Grimm</strong>: Relaxing in the back with his feet up, possibly munching on popcorn. This shows his laid-back personality and adds humor to the scene.</li>

<li><strong>Johnny Storm</strong>: Flying around the Fantasticar, possibly leaving a trail to show his path. He's high energy and always moving.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Enhancing Silhouettes and Shadows</h3>

<p>I focus on <strong>silhouetting</strong> the characters within their compartments. The dark portions of their costumes, like the shoulder pieces, help them stand out against the lighter parts of the Fantasticar or the sky.</p>

<p>I use <strong>cast shadows</strong> to create depth and enhance the silhouettes. For example, Reed's arm casts a shadow that conveniently connects with the dark part of his costume, helping it stand out.</p>

<h3>Adjusting Values</h3>

<p>I consider making <strong>Sue's hair white</strong> to help it pop against the background. This also creates a connection between her and Johnny, who appears as a bright flame. I adjust shadows and highlights to ensure each character reads clearly and stands out in the composition.</p>

<h3>Balancing the Composition</h3>

<p>I like the balance of <strong>curvilinear shapes</strong> with <strong>rectilinear shapes</strong>, and the dynamic juxtaposition of the Fantasticar not aligning perfectly with the city. The city provides stability, while the Fantasticar adds movement. This balance of <strong>unity and diversity</strong> creates a dynamic and exciting composition.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p>Now that I bring the title back into the composition, it <strong>looks like a cover</strong> to me. The dynamics, storytelling elements, and movement are all present. It captures what I saw in my mind's eye, and I'm happy with how it's turned out.</p>

<p>There's:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Excitement and Movement</strong></li>

<li><strong>Family Dynamics</strong></li>

<li><strong>Individual Personalities and Powers</strong></li>

<li><strong>Iconic Elements</strong> like the Fantasticar and the Baxter Building</li>

</ul>

<p>Most importantly, it <strong>reads strongly</strong>, which is exactly what I'm looking for in my thumbnails. If I chose to develop this further, I could enhance it with more drawing, adding highlights, reflections, and details to make it pop even more. But for now, it serves its purpose as a solid foundation for a cover.</p>
