<h2>Analyzing the Page and Separating Scenes</h2>

<p>I've just finished flatting a page. As you can see, I've added the other two panels to the one I demonstrated earlier. This page has three panels:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Panel 1</strong>: Set outside in cold snow.</li>

<li><strong>Panels 2 and 3</strong>: Inside the Avengers headquarters.</li>

</ul>

<p>My immediate focus is on contrasting these two scenes, the inside and the outside. I start thinking about how to portray the outside, and how to contrast that with the inside.</p>

<p>Sometimes, I'm drawn to an interesting environment like the establishing shot in the first panel. It's the biggest image on the page and deserves the majority of my attention. I'm looking for ways to <strong>separate planes</strong> and <strong>push space</strong> to make the image dynamic. I consider what's shown in the art and look for indications of a <strong>light source</strong> within the inks that I need to pay attention to.</p>

<h2>Using Channels and Alpha Masks</h2>

<p>I often have my <strong>Channels</strong> palette open alongside my <strong>Layers</strong> palette. In the Channels palette, I like to make <strong>masks</strong> to <strong>isolate certain areas</strong>. I can load these masks as selections later, allowing me to quickly grab large areas like the whole background, the characters, or extreme foreground elements.</p>

<p>For example, I might select the foreground chunk of ice and save that selection as an <strong>alpha channel</strong>. This way, I can easily load that selection later by holding down <strong>Control</strong> and clicking on the channel. I go through and do this for various elements:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Foreground Ice</strong></li>

<li><strong>The Celestial and surrounding ice</strong></li>

<li><strong>Environments in Panels 2 and 3</strong></li>

<li><strong>Characters in Panels 2 and 3</strong></li>

<li><strong>Background Elements</strong></li>

</ul>

<p>These masks help me define <strong>foreground</strong>, <strong>middle ground</strong>, and <strong>background</strong>, and allow me to <strong>quickly apply changes</strong> to these areas as I work.</p>

<h2>Setting the Palette</h2>

<p>Although I've flatted the page with a bunch of blues, which already creates a harmonious palette, I might tweak it a bit. I look at what the artist has indicated with their art, such as light sources. In this case, the light seems to be coming from back and over the celestial's shoulder. I consider making the background a little lighter or even slightly different hues from the foreground.</p>

<p>To adjust the palette, I often use <strong>opacity fills</strong>. For example, I might select the background and apply a <strong>40% fill</strong> with a lighter green to unify the area and push the background further back. If the result is too green, I'll adjust by adding warmer colors using lower opacity fills.</p>

<p>I think about where the warm light from the sun might be coming in and where the cooler tones of an approaching storm could be. I might adjust the mountains by pushing one closer to us with cooler tones and pushing another back with warmer tones.</p>

<h2>Working with Opacity and Blending Modes</h2>

<p>I do a lot of my work using <strong>opacities</strong>. Instead of changing colors directly, I use fills and adjustments at various opacities to achieve the desired effect. For example, I might use a <strong>40% fill</strong> with a blue to cool down a foreground element.</p>

<p>Additionally, I sometimes experiment with <strong>blending modes</strong> when applying fills. After applying a fill, I bring up the <strong>Fade Fill</strong> dialog box and change the blending mode to adjust how the fill interacts with the underlying colors. Modes like <strong>Soft Light</strong> can retain contrast and values while adding the color I want.</p>

<h2>Adjusting Foreground, Middle Ground, and Background</h2>

<p>I'm always looking for ways to <strong>separate planes</strong> and <strong>push for contrast</strong>. For instance, I might darken the foreground element to bring it forward or lighten the background to push it back. I often use opacity fills and gradients to achieve this effect.</p>

<p>When working with planes like ice, I consider where the light is catching the tops of these planes and how that can create focal points. I might warm up the top planes of ice where the sun is hitting and cool down the shadowed sides.</p>

<h2>Coloring Characters and Environments Separately</h2>

<p>When characters are in well-known costumes, like <strong>Captain America</strong>, I often separate them from the environment to avoid washing out their colors. I'll apply washes to the environment and the characters separately to maintain the integrity of their iconic colors.</p>

<p>For example, I might 40% fill the environment with a warm color to set its palette, then apply a subtle wash to the characters to settle them into the scene without drastically changing their costume colors.</p>

<h2>Working with Light and Shadow</h2>

<p>I pay close attention to where the light is coming from and how it affects different elements. If there's warm light coming from one side and cool tones from another, I use this to create <strong>contrast and depth</strong>.</p>

<p>I might use gradients at low opacities to bring in cool colors from one direction, simulating an approaching storm. I can also use the <strong>Gradient Tool</strong> set to <strong>Foreground to Transparent</strong> to add these effects smoothly.</p>

<h2>Coloring Tones and Final Adjustments</h2>

<p>The artist may have included tones or ink washes in the art, which can override the colors I've put down and skew my perception. To address this, I create a <strong>clipping mask</strong> above the tones layer and color the tones separately. This allows me to adjust the tones without affecting the underlying colors.</p>

<p>I might also turn on additional layers, like snow, and adjust their colors to better integrate them into the scene. If the white snow is too harsh, I might color it a light blue and apply gradients to soften it.</p>

<h2>Balancing the Page</h2>

<p>I try not to take one part of the page fully to completion before moving on to another. Instead, I get the background to a certain stage, then work on the characters, and then jump back and forth. This way, I can see how adjustments in one area affect the rest of the page.</p>

<p>For example, I might realize that the background mountains are too close in value to the sky and need to be adjusted. I can pull a gradient of the sky color over the mountains to push them further back, blending the line between them.</p>

<p>I continue to <strong>tweak elements</strong>, adjusting values, saturation, and hues as needed. There's a lot of <strong>push and pull</strong> in this process, and it's common to revisit areas and make changes as the page develops.</p>

<h2>Using Swatches and Color Palettes</h2>

<p>You'll notice that I use my <strong>Swatches</strong> palette extensively. I prefer working with swatches because I've had them for years and they help me work quickly. Many of my swatches are based on classic color formulas, named after their <strong>CMYK values</strong> (Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, Black), which refer to the printing plates.</p>

<p>I find that working with tested swatches gives me confidence in how the colors will print. While some artists use the color picker or other methods, I stick to what I'm most comfortable with.</p>

<h2>Closing Thoughts</h2>

<p>Throughout this process, my goal is to create a page that is dynamic and visually engaging. By carefully setting the palette, separating planes, and considering light sources, I can enhance the storytelling and guide the viewer's eye where I want it to go.</p>

<p>Remember, there's no one-size-fits-all approach. Experimentation is key. Use opacity fills, blending modes, gradients, and clipping masks to achieve the effects you want. Don't be afraid to adjust and revisit areas as you work. The push and pull of this process is what ultimately brings the page to life.</p>
