<h2>The Birth of Perspective</h2>

<p><strong>Perspective began in Italy 600 years ago</strong> when <strong>Florentine artists</strong> discovered it, revolutionizing how you can depict space and reality.</p>

<h3>Uccello and da Vinci</h3>

<p>In the 15th century, <strong>Paolo Uccello</strong> created complex drawings that seem computer-generated. You'll understand his perspectives better when you study ellipses.</p>

<p><strong>Leonardo da Vinci</strong> drew <strong>perspective studies</strong> with grids to track how figures move in space. You can learn from his preliminary work and storytelling.</p>

<h2>The Spread Across Europe</h2>

<p><strong>Renaissance artists</strong> drew objects from multiple views, front, side, top, back, to depict them in any position.</p>

<h3>Albrecht Dürer</h3>

<p>Perspective spread to Germany through <strong>Albrecht Dürer</strong>, who illustrated how light beams become dots on a window, connecting them to draw in perspective.</p>

<h3>Hans Vredeman de Vries</h3>

<p><strong>Hans Vredeman de Vries</strong>, a Dutch artist, loved perspective and used simple one-point and two-point perspectives with visible horizon lines. You can practice with his basic setups.</p>

<h2>Perspective in Modern Art</h2>

<p>By the time photography emerged, <strong>perspective was essential</strong> in European art education.</p>

<h3>Photography's Impact</h3>

<p>In the 19th century, <strong>photography changed art</strong>. <strong>Impressionists</strong> focused on light, while <strong>Expressionists</strong> bent perspective to express themselves.</p>

<h3>Japanese Woodblock Prints</h3>

<p><strong>Japanese artists</strong> embraced perspective. <strong>Hiroshi Yoshida</strong> created prints impeccable in perspective, depicting buildings and organic forms like water.</p>

<h3>20th Century Changes</h3>

<p>During the 20th century, many fine artists <strong>abandoned perspective</strong>. However, <strong>comic book artists, animators, illustrators, and graphic designers</strong> continued to use it. <strong>M.C. Escher</strong> made great pre-computer perspective masterpieces.</p>
