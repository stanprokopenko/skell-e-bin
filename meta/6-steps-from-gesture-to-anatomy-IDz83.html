<h2>Starting with the Gesture</h2>

<p>I begin by capturing the <strong>gesture</strong> of the figure, a quick, flowing sketch that represents the <strong>movement and energy</strong> of the pose. In complex poses, like a forward lean with a slight bend, it's crucial to <strong>keep lines light and airy</strong>, and use minimal pressure. This approach helps when you add more details later on.</p>

<h2>Indicating Landmarks</h2>

<p>Next, I <strong>indicate key landmarks</strong> using simple shapes:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Spine</strong></li>

<li><strong>Sacrum</strong></li>

<li><strong>Scapulae</strong></li>

<li><strong>Pelvis</strong></li>

<li><strong>Joints</strong></li>

</ul>

<p>These landmarks help me understand the <strong>proportions</strong> and <strong>alignment</strong> of the figure. I use circles, triangles, and straight lines as shorthand, which simplifies the process and keeps the focus on the overall structure.</p>

<h2>Considering Perspective</h2>

<p>Understanding the <strong>perspective</strong> of the figure is essential. I visualize the <strong>rib cage</strong> and <strong>pelvic box</strong> in three dimensions, noting how they're oriented in space. This helps in accurately placing muscles and understanding how they wrap around the forms.</p>

<h2>Adding Muscles and Anatomy</h2>

<p>With the structure in place, I begin adding <strong>muscles</strong> over the forms. I think of muscles as <strong>tumbling shapes</strong>, especially in the limbs. For example:</p>

<ul>

<li>The <strong>gluteus maximus</strong> is like a butterfly shape that wraps around the pelvis.</li>

<li>The <strong>hamstrings</strong> can be simplified into three shapes.</li>

<li>The <strong>calf muscles</strong> are higher on the outside and lower on the inside, reflecting their anatomical structure.</li>

</ul>

<p>I pay attention to the <strong>contours</strong> and how they move across the surfaces, which conveys the form without needing to draw every detail.</p>

<h2>Emphasizing Pinches and Stretches</h2>

<p>Muscles reflect the body's <strong>pinches</strong> and <strong>stretches</strong>:</p>

<ul>

<li>On the <strong>pinching side</strong>, muscles are shorter and compressed.</li>

<li>On the <strong>stretching side</strong>, muscles are longer and elongated.</li>

</ul>

<p>This understanding helps me design the shapes and lines that represent muscle forms accurately, enhancing the figure's dynamism.</p>

<h2>Rendering Surfaces and Light</h2>

<p>When rendering, I consider how <strong>light interacts with the forms</strong>:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Core shadows</strong> indicate where the form turns away from the light.</li>

<li><strong>Cast shadows</strong> show where one form blocks light from another.</li>

</ul>

<p>By focusing on the <strong>geometry</strong> of the forms, I render them more effectively, making them look three-dimensional without heavy shading. It's about conveying the surface and volume through thoughtful line work.</p>

<h2>Working Holistically</h2>

<p>I ensure to <strong>work through the entire figure</strong> rather than fixating on one area. This holistic approach keeps proportions consistent and the drawing unified. It prevents overworking parts of the figure and maintains a cohesive style throughout.</p>

<h2>Designing with Gesture</h2>

<p>Anatomy isn't just about accuracy, it's also about <strong>design</strong> and <strong>movement</strong>. I use the gesture to inform,</p>

<ul>

<li>The <strong>shapes</strong> of the muscles</li>

<li>The <strong>flow</strong> of lines across the forms</li>

<li>The overall <strong>rhythm</strong> of the figure</li>

</ul>

<p>By integrating gesture and anatomy, I create drawings that are both structurally sound and expressive. This approach allows me to convey not just the figure's appearance but its energy and motion as well.</p>
