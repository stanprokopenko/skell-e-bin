<p>Welcome back! Today, we're going to draw some limber limbs. By this point, your hand is probably quite limber, and we're going to <strong>exploit that</strong> for the genesis of everything. There's a lot in this lesson that I think you can handle because we've come so far. We're going to <strong>keep the flow going</strong>, get <strong>very gestural</strong>, and shake off the shackles of structure. While structure is incredibly important, we don't want to show those mechanics or the wheels turning. So let's draw and <strong>earn the magician's hat</strong>.</p>

<h2>Using Mnemonics in Drawing</h2>

<p>I'm starting with a General's charcoal pencil. It's a thinner lead than some other pencils, but it's a terrific pencil, especially if you run out of your favorites. Even in a pinch, it's easily available in shops. We're going with a back pose here and putting in our usual <strong>mnemonic shapes</strong>. Remember, <strong>mnemonics are a powerful tool</strong>. They make our memory sharper because they're so strange.</p>

<h3>Simplifying Complex Forms</h3>

<p>If we thought of a rib cage as a thoracic cage with ribs going at diagonals, and manubriums and sternums, it wouldn't be such an easy gig to draw one. But a tube with an egg around it? That's a very easy thing, a structure with a quite gestural structure encapsulated around it. Let's take that little moment on the left and call it the genesis of everything we need to know about drawing a back view. It has the shoulders, little lumps, the arms as gestural flowing lines, the Liberty Bell, and the feet as a little heart shape because they are coming at us with the back of the feet showing to the viewer.</p>

<h3>Observing Movement in Anatomy</h3>

<p>Now, when an arm is up and the scapula is tilted, the second we see Mr. T pulled on like that and counterbalanced against the Liberty Bell, we know the <strong>pinch</strong> is on the left and the <strong>stretch</strong> is on the right. We don't have a standing pose and therefore we don't have <strong>contrapposto</strong> to guide us into where that is. Of course, you could simplify it right down and say, well, there's the pinch at the obliques.</p>

<h2>The Importance of Understanding What's Underneath</h2>

<p>There could be cloth in the way, there could be anything happening. That's why I prefer to draw the <strong>nude figure</strong> because once the clothes go on, everyone's at sea until the artist who knows what's under the clothes comes into the picture and says, it's not so bad folks, here's what's under there, and shows their magic in the class.</p>

<h2>Being Both Teacher and Student</h2>

<p>So <strong>be a teacher</strong>. Look forward to questions, even if you're not teaching as a profession, because it will make you a better artist. <strong>Having to describe something really tells you what you know and what you don't know</strong>. If you can't describe it, go re-examine why. I always have internal dialogue going on. I'm the teacher and the pupil at the same time. <strong>Always ask yourself questions</strong>.</p>

<h2>Simplicity in Art</h2>

<p>A beautiful frontalis there. See how easy it is to put a sleepy eye in? You just don't put the eye dot in. Instead, you thicken the bottom part of the eyeball, and that tells us the eyelashes have come down to close the eyes. It's a very simple way to do it, but at this size, this kind of schematic size, it reads absolutely fine. In fact, it's a beautiful thing. <strong>Simplicity is the most important thing for me in art as I get older</strong>.</p>

<h2>Depicting Anatomy with Minimal Lines</h2>

<p>In goes the sacrum tail, the little tailbone, and that tells us the end of the sacrum. Just below that, we swing across to get the <strong>great trochanter bones</strong>, which are at an angle now. That little moment will take us down through the <strong>gluteal line</strong>, to find the <strong>sit bones</strong> coming out of their little quick ramps there. Now I can put in the <strong>sacrum dimples</strong>. We don't have to put the entire sacrum shape in, sometimes the little dimples are just enough. In fact, putting the whole sacrum in looks a little mechanical. It's beautiful for demonstration drawings, but for drawings where you want to say, "This is art now, not just a demonstration of how to draw art," we don't want to really show the <strong>mechanics</strong>.</p>

<h2>Avoiding Ego in Art</h2>

<p>There's two things that bother me there. One is that you're showing off or appear to be. The other is that it's a kind of insecurity. It's almost like you don't want to take it out, because it shows how much you know. But <strong>take out as much as you can once the mechanics go in</strong>. Then you really will impress with what remains, because it looks like <strong>magic</strong> then. So it will fulfill your prophecy in a different way. And that leads me to, once again, <strong>beware of ego</strong>. <strong>Ego is the death of art</strong>. When we start showing off, try it. When you start showing off, everything falls apart. Here, I'm drawing or dancing along the drawing like no one's watching, and it becomes a much better drawing right away.</p>

<h2>Chasing Rhythms and Gestures</h2>

<p>There's some little ghosts of mechanics in there, the iliac crest, for instance. But basically, this is all the powers of mnemonics, osmosis, and long-term and short-term memory all coming into the fold to give us a rhythmic, beautiful drawing. So I'm <strong>chasing rhythms down this form</strong> with all that mechanical stuff happening in the background, in the subconscious art engine, the <strong>hippocampus</strong>.</p>

<h2>Adding Character and Story</h2>

<p>Look at that beautiful moment there of the magnus muscles. There's more than just the magnus in there, but I think of the magnus as the swell because it's the most buoyant muscle in there. It's a huge muscle, it goes right around to the back. So we're just seeing the edge of it really from the front, but it makes a huge statement.</p>

<h2>Incorporating Subtle Details</h2>

<p>Every once in a while, I put a little bit of jewelry in there, an indication of it. And through years and years of doing this, lots and lots, a little wiggle and a squiggle will tell the tale. <strong>The less we draw detail, the more impressive it looks</strong>, especially to the subconscious, not overburdened by all of that.</p>

<h2>Combining Unexpected Elements</h2>

<p>This hand going in, quite a creepy hand. Even though she's curvaceous, which usually denotes innocence, I've upended that idea by putting a gnarly hand in there, and it brought a sinister element to it. So once we put two things together that shouldn't really belong, it becomes this immediate interesting thing because we weren't expecting that. And that's the way to create great art. <strong>Metaphor</strong> - all those things that are the subtext of art that could denote that beauty is sometimes a dangerous thing.</p>

<h2>The Power of Osmosis</h2>

<p><strong>Draw repeat patterns from all different angles.</strong> See how many angles we're taking here. Now, some of them might look the same, but every one of them is slightly different, a slight different turn of the head. It's almost like the lottery, it's nearly impossible to find the same numbers repeat again twice. Well, it's never happened in the lottery. And so, think of it like that. <strong>Familiar shapes, which is what the power is, are slightly different every time.</strong></p>

<p>In order for us not to be overruled by one pattern, a standing figure, always equal on each side, that kind of thing, we need to feed the engine with many patterns that are similar. And then we'll meet these patterns a hundred times, a thousand times in the life drawing class or from photos. But <strong>beware of the photos, for their distortion</strong>.</p>

<h2>Influences and Inspirations</h2>

<p>Here we are drawing a thing of beauty that was what absolutely captivated me when I was reading comic books for the first time, as a teenager with no skills at all and just believing it was all magic. And these artists like <strong>John Buscema</strong> and <strong>Jack Kirby</strong>, they were one of a kind, mind you. But I thought they were magicians that only appear once in a while, and it's just the luck that we had them there. No one else could be anywhere close. And that's not true. There have been many, many artists since that have been astonishing.</p>

<p>When I learned that there was actually method to it, John Buscema brought out a book, <strong>How to Draw the Marvel Way</strong>. And to be honest, there wasn't much in there, but there was enough. There was a germ of what I needed. Some of it was a little destructive because there was no <strong>digastric plane</strong> showing in any of those drawings, and so I wasn't equipped for dimensional art.</p>

<p>John wanted to be a painter, and the proof in the pudding there was that he appeared to be a god with the pencil, but with paint? Ordinary. And I don't say that disparagingly, just an observation. I know he could have been an amazing painter, he wanted to be, but he just didn't put the time in. The way you hold a paintbrush and the difference between a hard-edged and a soft-edged brush makes all the difference in art. So you've got to <strong>explore all those brushes and all those solvents, and a million different things</strong>. If he put all the hours in that he did drawing into painting, then he would have been incredible, but he didn't.</p>

<h2>Drawing with Emotion and Story</h2>

<p>Look at this little character here, filled with life and joy. This actual pose could be a metaphor for that, a metaphor for the joy in art, an allegory really. <strong>The joy of art is in every line here</strong>. So when you're drawing, see if you can bring some subtext in. We're not just drawing a figure here. **What's the reason for it? What does it say? ** What does this figure say? Well, that face could say loneliness, couldn't it? It has a lonely little moment to it, a pensive nature to it. So as I draw, I always give the character something to think about, and then that attitude of the idea of that, the theme of it, sadness, loneliness, love, any of those things, can inform what you do next. Well, it will do, actually.</p>

<p>I put an earring in there because I feel that she's quite posh, and that this is a whimsical moment in her life. Maybe it is the turn of the century, and her betrothed has gone to war and may not return. Maybe he's a general. All those things really help the drawing become something else. <strong>So ask yourself each time you draw a figure, what are they thinking?</strong> ** And then give them a little story. It does not take two minutes to give them a story of some kind. It doesn't have to have a conclusion to it, just the germ of an idea, a theme. And you can even give it a premise. So a theme would be love, for instance, and a premise would be a stranger walks into town.</p>

<h2>Embracing Quirkiness</h2>

<p>So a little bit of quirkiness coming in here. I'll think of that, the theme here could not just be a figure, it could be <strong>quirk</strong>. It could be <strong>quirkiness</strong>, and it could be every line is a quirky thought. And so I'm doing that, quirky, knock-kneed, twisty character here. And listen to all those words I just used. They are more evocative than a whole sentence. They are basically <strong>prompts</strong> to what I want to do next with this drawing. And it's a joy.</p>

<h2>The Underhand Grip Technique</h2>

<p>Some up close, some close to the point of the pencil, always avoiding that detail hand, the writing grip. It's marvelous. Look how I can scoot around, have my hand horizontal, for instance, and then vertical. Try that with a detailed hand and see how awkward it is, and you'll understand why artists draw like this. <strong>Why the underhand grip is such a powerful tool to make expressive marks</strong>.</p>

<p>I mean, the most obvious is you can't make a broad mark if you're resting on the tip of the pencil. There you go again. Look at that beautiful moment there where I can go horizontal, drop the pencil down onto its broad edge, and get that big swathe of tone for the underside of the gluteus there.</p>

<h2>The Beauty of Pencil Drawing</h2>

<p>Take a moment to look at the beauty of line and tone, there up close. It's gorgeous, isn't it? And I just love pencil for that reason. It's so <strong>organic</strong>, it's so <strong>immediate</strong>. It has a visceral reaction for me in my heart. I can really feel it when I look at pencil. It's that <strong>human hand</strong> that did it.</p>

<h2>Learning from Ancient Art</h2>

<p>I was looking at the <strong>Venus of Willendorf</strong> the other day, 28,000 years ago. People, us, were creating art, and it was a magnificent piece of art. We may look back and say they were primitive people, they just didn't have the 28,000 years later to build on. They had no shoulders to rest on, the shoulders of giants like John Buscema, Michelangelo, Rembrandt. None of those guys existed yet, so they were all alone. They were inventing the wheel. And so it was incredible to think that they weren't these hairy barbarians, even though they lived in caves. They were <strong>sensitive</strong>, and they were <strong>artistic</strong>, just like us. Imagine how hard their life was, and how wonderful art became as a tool to tell stories, to show beauty, and to record what was happening back then. It was the only thing, images scrawled on cave walls. No cameras, no books, nothing. Amazing.</p>

<p>So art, if anyone ever asks or says, is it really important? Well, think about that. Think of what that cave person was showing, their emotion, recording what they saw, and making a lasting, I mean 28,000-year tribute to their partner in that cave. They sculpted what they loved, and it was an emotional echo through the ages. And we still look at it today.</p>

<h2>Drawing with Joy and Emotion</h2>

<p>Here I'm drawing a thing of beauty, that was what absolutely captivated me when I was reading comic books for the first time. As a teenager with no skills at all, just believing it was all magic. And these artists like John Buscema and Jack Kirby, they were one of a kind, mind you. But I thought they were magicians that only appear once in a while, and it's just the luck that we had them there, and no one else could be anywhere close. And that's not true. There have been many, many artists since that have been astonishing.</p>

<p>So I'm looking back to my teenage years, those formative years, and they, to me, were gods of art. And there's many of them. <strong>We can do this</strong>.</p>

<h2>The Importance of Gestural Drawing</h2>

<p>Let's look at a flow here, a beautiful flow of a figure, its leg going back and toe pointed, coming off the ground a little bit. This is a figure in <strong>motion</strong>, and that's why gestural drawings are so important. Because if you do a long pose, you're not going to get a gestural pose. The model can't hold this kind of pose for more than a few seconds. And I guess that's where photography wins out, because you have that frozen moment in time. So let's hail the photograph. It often sounds like I'm dismissive of photography, but it is an incredible tool. But remember, it's only a tool.</p>

<h2>Avoiding Over-Mechanization</h2>

<p>In goes the scapula, quickly around for the serratus as a bulk shape. You'll see the serratus coming around to the ninth rib, and it goes all the way up to the first. So it's a good way to plot out where the tenth rib will eventually be. It's just a broad angle there. Eleventh and twelfth at the back make it look like it is shorter than it should be. These are schematic, these are quick, and so I'm not being entirely accurate, and I don't want to be because it would <strong>kill the beauty of that pose</strong>.</p>

<p>Broad shapes get you in that ballpark, and you can come back later if you want to be more academic and fix it up with more accuracy. Now, that term <strong>fix it up</strong> won't make the drawing any more beautiful, probably, and most likely less beautiful. But if a collector is looking for an academic piece of art, then you have the skills to do either. If a collector is looking for your <strong>joyful sketches</strong>, they want this. And there's nothing more joyful than this sketch going on right now. Look at those <strong>rhythms</strong>.</p>

<h2>Switching Between Structure and Gesture</h2>

<p>I'm working with a rhythmic idea. I get the broad line of the pencil down to begin with, and it gives me lots of room to maneuver in and out. See the broad end for the underside of the breast there? That was more to say there's weight here. There's a <strong>digastric plane</strong> that the comic book artist would leave out. It's a little cheese slice under the chin. We practically always see it from the profile view unless the head tilts towards us, say from this view here, it would disappear. Or the head tips down, like on the left there, it might disappear then. Well, it will. But remember, the head is a dimensional thing, so it needs to be there. If we're going to render, for instance, otherwise it will look very odd.</p>

<h2>Embracing Fluidity in Drawing</h2>

<p>Putting a lot of action into this little twist and turn here, and that moment that I'm showing there is the obliques fitting in like a wedge because there are other elements there as well. There's thoracic muscles and a lot of stuff coming down at that point to reach onto those sacrum areas, the latissimus and all the other things that are there too. Big pipes going up the back to support our spine. I'll often put a little wedge in there because you'll see that reverberation of pinch coming out like that.</p>

<h2>Learning and Adapting Techniques</h2>

<p>So let's get ambitious based on the idea we just talked about there. <strong>We shouldn't fear any drawing because our drawings will not topple over</strong>. So I want to draw a figure here and make it move. So I'm going to draw a figure that is quite well balanced. It is tipping forward a little bit. Remember, every time you walk, you're falling, and then your foot comes forward to stop that happening. That's what a walk is. So you move your head forward, you better have that foot coming with it. So she's on the tipping point here.</p>

<h2>The Role of Mistakes in Learning</h2>

<p>It's just a natural part of the process that you're going to do a skewed drawing or a bad drawing, if you want to call it that. But it just leads to the next drawing, which is going to be a better drawing for all those reasons, that you haven't relied on tropes, done the same thing over and over, only the same thing. You are doing the same thing over and over here, but in different views, shapes that repeat themselves in different angles.</p>

<h2>Embracing the Joy of Drawing</h2>

<p>These are <strong>wild frothy fluid drawings</strong> for the end of the day to just add and add to that subconscious. That came together quite nicely. But don't consider any of it proportionally accurate. It's ballpark accurate, and after a while, when you look at all your favorite artists' work, you'll see that nothing is really proportionally accurate. It is nearly always the <strong>beauty of the gesture</strong> and the basic idea that none of the rules of nature have been broken. Everything is in the basic place it could be, should be.</p>

<h2>Balancing Gesture and Structure</h2>

<p>So keep that jam going on that page. I do lots of <strong>clangers</strong> to begin the day and do a little jam at the end of the day to bring it all back again. And it's the most joyous way to finish drawing. Of course, you'll end up with kind of clangers, but they're more like really good clangers. So the first clangers at the beginning of the day are <strong>rusty clangers</strong>, and these clangers at the end of the day are <strong>fluid clangers</strong>.</p>

<h2>Continuous Improvement</h2>

<p>As you get experience, you start to get the proportion after a while because of all these iterations that are leading us closer and closer to what we see in the life drawing. You start to see clearer and clearer and <strong>get better and better at those proportions without even method</strong>. Remember, the first people that painted and drew didn't have any method at all, and yet they did some beautiful stuff on those cave walls.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p>So there you go. We've explored many ideas today, embracing flow and gesture, using mnemonics, understanding anatomy, balancing gesture and structure, adding emotion and story to our drawings, and embracing the joy of drawing. <strong>Keep practicing, keep exploring, and most importantly, keep enjoying the process.</strong></p>
