<h2>Dry and Wet Mediums</h2>

<p>I like to think of materials as <strong>dry</strong> or <strong>wet</strong>. Charcoal and pastel are great examples of dry mediums, and oil paint or watercolor are common wet mediums. There’s also the surface factor, paper, canvas, a gessoed panel, or a digital canvas. Each combination of medium and surface brings unique challenges, but they’re usually straightforward to learn.</p>

<p><strong>Additive</strong> methods involve adding charcoal, paint, or other material. <strong>Subtractive</strong> methods involve removing it, erasing charcoal with an eraser or rubbing out oil paint with a cloth back down to the gesso. Gaining control over these mediums means <strong>becoming fluent</strong> with how to lay them down and remove them.</p>

<h2>The Real Challenge: Learning to See</h2>

<p>From my experience, the real trick in art isn’t wrangling materials, it’s <strong>learning to see</strong>. We want to see subtle differences in tone, shape, depth of field, and softness of edge, then figure out how to simplify that complexity in our art. This is the lifelong journey that keeps me growing as an artist.</p>

<p>Using simpler surfaces helps reduce distractions. I often choose <strong>smooth paper</strong> or a finer-weave canvas, so the texture won't interfere too much. From there, we can experiment with different media, such as graphite, charcoal, Prismacolor, conte, or paint, to find what suits us best.</p>

<h2>Hard, Soft, and Lost Edges</h2>

<p>When I’m applying line or tone, <strong>edges</strong> become crucial. We typically want:

- <strong>Hard edges</strong> for clear transitions or sharp outlines.<br />

- <strong>Soft edges</strong> with a very gentle micro-gradation, just enough to feel the softness where shapes meet.

- <strong>Lost edges</strong> where the edge vanishes into the background or another area, blending seamlessly.</p>

<p>Edges help define form and atmosphere, whether we’re drawing on paper or painting in oils.</p>

<h2>Line, Tone, and Shape</h2>

<p><strong>Line</strong> can be placed with a pencil, brush, pen, or stylus. It might be thin, thick, feathered, or varied in darkness. Then we have <strong>value and tone</strong>, the gradations from light to dark that build form. We need to position these lines and tones into <strong>shapes</strong>. Placing each shape in the right spot, with the correct proportions, is more of a <strong>design problem</strong> than a materials issue.</p>

<h2>Gradation</h2>

<p>Gradations are simply transitions that can be very quick (tiny soft edges) or quite extended. My favorite technique is a <strong>zigzag</strong> stroke back and forth:

- The tighter the zigzag, the smoother the blend and the more “realistic” it appears.<br />

- A looser, more open zigzag gives a painterly style.</p>

<p>We can also blend in a <strong>hatching</strong> manner, which uses parallel or slightly angled lines to vary the density of tone. More lines in one area darken the value, and fewer lines lighten it.</p>

<h2>Value vs. Color</h2>

<p>I often emphasize that <strong>value</strong> is what truly creates the illusion of depth and volume. If I use bright colors in shadows, the eye reads them as lighter. If I let go of intense color and stick to neutral or darker tones, shadows appear more convincing.</p>

<p>This means when practicing, <strong>aim for little or no color</strong> at first, like using black charcoal or earthy hues. Bright colored pencils can confuse the sense of light and dark, which makes it trickier to create realism and clear separation between light and shadow.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p>Materials aren’t complicated once we master simple strategies for line, tone, hard and soft edges, and controlled gradation. The lifelong work comes in training our eyes to see shapes and values accurately. Next, we’ll focus on two big ideas that form the foundation of everything in this course. I’m excited to show how those ideas tie into our entire creative process.</p>
