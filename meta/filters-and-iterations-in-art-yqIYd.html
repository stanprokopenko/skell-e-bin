<h2>The Holistic Approach</h2>

<p>I believe in combining <strong>science</strong> and <strong>intuition</strong> to create art. Science isn’t wrong. Anatomy, perspective, and the laws of light aren’t wrong. But there’s also creativity, emotion, and personal ideas. It’s <strong>not</strong> one or the other. We need <strong>balance</strong>. That’s what <strong>composition</strong> is about: balancing craft and imagination so they work together.</p>

<h2>Seeing Like an Artist</h2>

<p>It’s said that <em>90% of our brain’s power</em> goes to visual data. We’re visual creatures, so it’s no coincidence that we’re passionate about the visual arts. When we <em>draw</em> while taking notes, we’re more likely to remember what we learn.</p>

<p>Learning to <em>see the world</em> through an artist’s eyes is the real challenge. We can pick up drawing skills relatively quickly, but seeing the world in a fresh way and then getting that down on paper is a lifelong journey. Our goal is to make that process feel exciting rather than frustrating.</p>

<h2>Creativity and Education</h2>

<p>Around ages four to six, children’s creativity <em>plummets</em> worldwide when they enter public school. They’re often taught that there’s one <em>right answer</em> for problems. Meanwhile, an artist might see an <em>infinite number of ways</em> to paint the same sky. This contrast drives us to <em>balance</em> the facts of art (shadows need to be darker, etc.) with the imaginative <em>freedom</em> to decide <em>how</em> dark or where to place those shadows.</p>

<h2>Filters and Iterations</h2>

<p>My strategy centers on <strong>filters</strong> and <strong>iterations</strong>. These concepts help us master skills by breaking them down and repeating them in simple, engaging ways.</p>

<h3>Filters</h3>

<p>A filter is any <strong>idea</strong> or <strong>aspect</strong> of art. It could be:

- Shape design<br />

- Line quality<br />

- Value (light vs. shadow)<br />

- Composition<br />

- Emotional or conceptual intent  </p>

<p>We focus on <em>one or two filters</em> at a time instead of trying to master everything at once. If it’s too complicated, we <em>simplify</em> the challenge. Maybe we work on line and shape alone, <em>not</em> worrying about tone or proportion yet. Each filter becomes a separate learning goal.</p>

<h3>Iterations</h3>

<p>Once we pick our filter, we do it again and again, <strong>iterations</strong>. Baseball players hit balls over and over. We do the same in art. Repetition burns the skill into our muscle memory. We might repeat a drawing <em>48 times</em> until we feel that <em>little improvement</em>, that triggers our excitement. That <em>dopamine</em> rush encourages us to come back and do more the next day. Over time, these small gains build into strong drawing habits and personal style.</p>

<h2>Connection and Disconnection</h2>

<p>Art often explores <strong>connection</strong> and <strong>disconnection</strong>. We’re here, and we want to be <em>there</em>. In spiritual paintings, we see a divide with heaven up high, earth below, and a figure bridging both. Even if we’re not painting anything religious, we still convey emotions by positioning elements to show unity or separation.</p>

<p>This connects directly to filters like color choices, lighting, composition shapes, and the gestures or poses in our work. Whether we paint a grand spiritual scene or a portrait of grief, each detail is chosen with purpose. With <strong>immersion</strong> and <strong>repetition</strong>, we learn to use these details to communicate ideas and emotions effectively.</p>

<h2>Next Steps</h2>

<p>I want to help you quickly gain <em>fluency</em> with basic materials so they won’t slow you down. Then, we’ll move into deeper, more <strong>creative</strong> challenges. Our big goal is to create <em>beautiful, compelling</em> art. We’ll do that by practicing filters, building skills through iterations, and seeking a balance between knowledge and self-expression.</p>

<p>Thanks for being passionate about art and for joining me. I’m excited to explore how we can bring more beauty and connection into our work. Let’s keep going.</p>
