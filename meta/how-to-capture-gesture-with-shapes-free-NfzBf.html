<h2>What's in Premium?</h2>

<p>Learn an observational approach to drawing the figure by designing each part as a simple shape. In this lesson, we'll break down the figure into basic parts—<strong>head</strong>, <strong>neck</strong>, <strong>torso</strong>, <strong>arms</strong>, and <strong>legs</strong>—and explore the <strong>gesture</strong> of each. You'll learn how to apply simple perspective using <strong>wrapping lines</strong> and add <strong>light and shadow</strong> to bring out the form. We'll dive into techniques for designing the <strong>head</strong> and <strong>neck</strong>, modifying shapes to convey different characters and expressions. By connecting the parts and employing light and shadow, you'll create figures that are structurally sound and have a strong sense of character. This method is particularly beneficial if you have some anatomy knowledge and want to get to light and shadow more directly in your figure drawings.</p>
