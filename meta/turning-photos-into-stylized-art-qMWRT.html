<p>Hi, I'm Ben, and I love to draw, paint, and sculpt stylized art. Today, I want to share how I use photo references to create stylized characters without sticking too closely to the original image. I'll walk you through my process of balancing 2D and 3D thinking to make our drawings more dynamic.</p>

<h2>Switching Between 2D and 3D Thinking</h2>

<p>When I approach a drawing, I toggle between <strong>two ways of thinking</strong>: <strong>2D shapes</strong> and <strong>3D forms</strong>. Imagine a slider where one end is a flat square (2D) and the other is a cube (3D). This mental shift helps me build up my sketches effectively.</p>

<h2>Starting with Basic Shapes</h2>

<p>I begin by <strong>laying down simple shapes</strong> that capture the essence of the reference. For instance, I might see a <strong>triangle shape</strong> in the head and sketch that out. At this stage, I'm firmly in <strong>2D land</strong>, focusing on the overall silhouette without getting bogged down in details.</p>

<h2>Introducing 3D Forms</h2>

<p>Once I have the basic 2D shapes, I <strong>tiptoe into 3D thinking</strong>. I start considering features like the <strong>eye sockets</strong> and the <strong>planes of the head</strong>. This involves visualizing how these elements exist in three-dimensional space, which adds depth to the drawing.</p>

<h2>Building Up the Drawing</h2>

<p>Working back and forth between 2D and 3D allows me to <strong>build the drawing from the ground up</strong>. I prefer this method over starting with a single feature, like an eye, and working outward. By establishing structural shapes first, I have a solid foundation to add details later.</p>

<h2>Refining Shapes</h2>

<p>I often <strong>knock back</strong> my initial sketch by reducing its opacity and then create a new layer to refine the shapes. This helps me <strong>be more decisive</strong> with my lines and improves the overall clarity of the drawing. I repeat this process, refining each time to enhance the stylization.</p>

<h2>Avoiding Early Details</h2>

<p>At this stage, I <strong>avoid focusing on details</strong>. Getting into the details too early can make it harder to adjust the drawing later. If I spend a lot of time rendering a section, I'm less likely to change it even if it needs adjustment. Staying loose keeps me open to making necessary changes.</p>

<h2>Using Digital Tools</h2>

<p>I utilize digital tools like <strong>flipping the canvas</strong>, which helps me get a fresh perspective and spot errors. The <strong>lasso tool</strong> and <strong>warp function</strong> help me adjust proportions and shapes quickly. Don't hesitate to use these tools, they're there to make the process smoother.</p>

<h2>Adding Shadows and Depth</h2>

<p>I add indications of <strong>cast shadows</strong>, especially under the chin and around the ear. This simple addition can <strong>pop certain features out</strong> and give the drawing more <strong>depth</strong>. Even if the final lighting will differ, it helps establish form early on.</p>

<h2>Learning from Other Artists</h2>

<p>I recommend <strong>studying artists</strong> whose work excites you. Try to <strong>reverse-engineer what they do</strong>. Is it their line quality, shading, or use of color that appeals to you? Incorporating aspects you admire into your own work helps you develop your unique style.</p>

<p>By <strong>switching between 2D and 3D thinking</strong>, starting with basic shapes, and refining as I go, I can stylize photo references effectively. Remember to stay loose, avoid getting caught up in details too soon, and make use of the digital tools at your disposal. Happy drawing!</p>
