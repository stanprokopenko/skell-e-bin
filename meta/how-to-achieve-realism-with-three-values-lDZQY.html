<p>Welcome! In this lesson, you'll learn how to paint using <strong>three values only</strong> - a white, a mid-value, and a black. These aren't exact, there can be some variation between them. The key point is to have <strong>three distinct values</strong> that you can easily distinguish. By matching these simplified values accurately, you will inevitably achieve a realistic impression. This method streamlines the painting process, and ensures success if you follow it.</p>

<h2>Simplifying Your Subject with Three Values</h2>

<p>When faced with a complex reference photo, it's easy to feel lost and confused. To make things simpler, start by turning your photo <strong>black and white</strong>. This reduces distractions and narrows down your focus to values instead of colors. But we'll take it one step further by reducing the number of values in the image.</p>

<h3>Using Photoshop to Reduce Values</h3>

<p>Here's how you can simplify your reference photo using Photoshop:</p>

<ol>

<li><strong>Convert the Image to Black and White</strong>: This eliminates color and lets you focus on value.</li>

<li><strong>Go to Image &gt; Adjustments &gt; Posterize</strong>: This tool reduces the number of values in the image.</li>

<li><strong>Choose the Number of Values</strong>: Decrease the value to simplify the image. Start with two and adjust accordingly.</li>

</ol>

<p>When posterizing, look for the number of values that keeps the <strong>story intact</strong>. For example, two values might be too simple, but three values often tell a good story. You can experiment with four values and see if it makes a significant difference.</p>

<h3>Sampling Your Values</h3>

<p>Once you've chosen the number of values, sample them:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>White</strong>: This will be your paper white.</li>

<li><strong>Mid-Value</strong>: A middle-of-the-road value, not too dark or light.</li>

<li><strong>Black</strong>: Your darkest value.</li>

</ul>

<p>Remember, you don't have to stick to pure black or white. The most important thing is having <strong>three distinct values</strong>.</p>

<h2>Preparing to Paint</h2>

<h3>Mixing Your Three Values</h3>

<p>Use a neutral color like Payne's gray, but any color will work as long as the values are correct. Mix your paints to create:</p>

<ol>

<li><strong>White</strong>: Leave the paper untouched.</li>

<li><strong>Mid-Value</strong>: Achieve this by using a thin consistency of paint with plenty of water.</li>

<li><strong>Almost Black</strong> - Mix a very dark value, you won't need much since these are smaller sections.</li>

</ol>

<h3>Starting with the Main Subject</h3>

<p>Begin by focusing on the part of the painting that interests you the most. For instance, you might start with a car that's the center of attention. By starting here, you can build everything else to support it.</p>

<h2>The Painting Process</h2>

<h3>Painting the Mid-Values</h3>

<ul>

<li><strong>Observe Your Reference</strong>: Use the simplified image to determine where your mid-values are.</li>

<li><strong>Connect Shadow Sections</strong>: Paint the areas that share the same value in one go.</li>

<li><strong>Leave Highlights</strong>: Skip areas where you see highlights to let the paper white show through.</li>

<li><strong>Focus on Shapes</strong>: Think in terms of abstract shapes rather than specific details.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Adding the Darkest Values</h3>

<p>Once the mid-values are in place:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Add Details with Dark Values</strong>: This includes windows, tires, and other dark elements.</li>

<li><strong>Simplify Background Elements</strong>: For distant cars or objects, simplify them by using your dark value and leaving a few highlights.</li>

<li><strong>Use Shapes to Define Forms</strong>: Don't worry about lines, focus on filling in the shapes you see.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Painting the Ground</h3>

<ul>

<li><strong>Adjust the Ground Value</strong>: Darkening the ground can give more meaning to the highlights and bring the whole painting together.</li>

<li><strong>Mix Enough Paint</strong>: Ensure you have enough mid-value paint to cover the ground.</li>

<li><strong>Avoid Scrubbing</strong>: Apply the wash gently to prevent reactivating previous layers.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Enhancing Mid-Values with Context</h3>

<p>By adding darks and adjusting the ground, the mid-values start to make more sense:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Add Small Details</strong>: Include indications of bricks or patterns with simple strokes.</li>

<li><strong>Limit Detailing</strong>: Only add details where necessary to avoid overcomplicating the painting.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Final Touches</h2>

<h3>Adding Dark Details for Depth</h3>

<ul>

<li><strong>Paint Windows and Shadows</strong>: Use your darkest value to bring out these elements.</li>

<li><strong>Create Contrast</strong>: The darks will enhance the highlights and mid-values.</li>

<li><strong>Use a Bigger Brush</strong>: This helps cover larger areas and keeps the process efficient.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Incorporating Highlights</h3>

<ul>

<li><strong>Use Gel Pens or Opaque Paint</strong>: If you lose a highlight, you can bring it back with these tools.</li>

<li><strong>Add Thin Highlights</strong>: Small touches can make a big difference in realism.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Managing Shadows and Edges</h3>

<ul>

<li><strong>Add Cast Shadows</strong>: This frames the scene and adds depth.</li>

<li><strong>Soften Edges if Needed</strong>: You can loosen up edges to blend shapes together.</li>

</ul>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p>By following this process, you can create a realistic painting using just <strong>three values</strong>. This method simplifies the complex task of painting and provides a reliable blueprint for achieving realism. Remember, while there are more skills to learn, like color, temperature, and composition, this approach gives you a solid foundation. You now have a foolproof method for creating the sense of realism you desire. Use it, build upon it, and make it your own.</p>
