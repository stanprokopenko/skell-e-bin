<h2>Using Gesture in Group Figures</h2>

<p>When I look at Peter Paul Rubens' work, I want to understand how to use gesture in groups. It's rare to see figures isolated from others, they're often interacting in dynamic compositions. So, my goal is to analyze <strong>how to compose figures together</strong>.</p>

<p>I start by laying down my gesture lines, without narrating each one. Here's the <strong>weight-bearing leg</strong> and the <strong>supporting leg</strong>, using different economies of line, sometimes shorter curves like C's for the active side, and longer, more S-like lines for the passive side. I incorporate <strong>wrapping lines</strong> and indicate the <strong>shoulders</strong> and <strong>scapula</strong>.</p>

<h3>Creating Rhythms and Connections</h3>

<p>In paintings that feature multiple figures, I notice that gesture can be used to <strong>organize the eight parts of the body</strong> and even <strong>blend into the next figure</strong>. By abstracting these as directional rhythms, I can create a <strong>connected tether</strong> from one figure to another.</p>

<p>For instance, the line of an arm might extend outward, then back and forward, serving as a rhythmic and spatial introduction to another figure. Rubens is masterful at creating <strong>subtle dips forward and back, in front and behind</strong>, almost like <strong>little macaroni pieces</strong> that guide you through space. These rhythms are <strong>spatially motivated</strong> and help build visual continuity.</p>

<p>Even the <strong>drapery</strong> plays into these rhythms. Drapery can extend gesture, creating lines that <strong>wrap around</strong>, <strong>loop</strong>, and connect different parts of the composition. Studying these aspects allows me to pick up elements I might want to use later or appreciate in an artist differently.</p>

<h2>Analyzing Character Gestures: Abby from The Last of Us</h2>

<p>I really enjoyed Abby's character in <strong>The Last of Us</strong>. She has a unique arc with <strong>three acts</strong>, and her <strong>body language</strong> reflects her evolution. Studying her poses helps me understand <strong>why I'm engaged with her character</strong>.</p>

<h3>Understanding Body Language and Storytelling</h3>

<p>In her early iteration, Abby appears as a young woman who's <strong>carefree</strong> and <strong>easygoing</strong>. Her body language is <strong>asymmetrical</strong>, with a contrapposto stance that feels natural and youthful. The <strong>head is up</strong>, and the angles are offset, creating a <strong>playful dynamic</strong>.</p>

<p>As her character becomes more <strong>severe and harsh</strong>, her pose changes. She adopts a <strong>static shape</strong>, which is confrontational and symmetrical. This <strong>symmetry</strong> is stable and often used for <strong>political or religious iconography</strong>. Her <strong>head is bowed</strong>, and the neck is straight on, giving a <strong>threatening feel</strong>. This contrasts sharply with her earlier, more relaxed poses.</p>

<h3>Evolution Through Different Acts</h3>

<p>By analyzing her gestures, I appreciate how <strong>shape language</strong> and <strong>body positioning</strong> convey her transformation. The younger Abby uses softer shapes and asymmetry, while the hardened Abby is depicted with <strong>sharper angles</strong> and a <strong>rigid stance</strong>. This demonstrates how <strong>gesture is crucial in storytelling and character design</strong>.</p>

<p>No amount of detail can substitute for this understanding. If you've ever felt that your rendering lacks something, focusing on gesture can bridge that gap.</p>

<h2>Learning from Rodin's Gestures</h2>

<p>Rodin's figures often have <strong>strange poses</strong> that don't seem proportionate, but they're rich with gesture. I approach them using the same gesture lines but remain open to what I can learn.</p>

<h3>Appreciating Longer Relational Rhythms</h3>

<p>In one of Rodin's sculptures, I notice the <strong>rhythm of the back</strong> flowing into the leg, a beautiful use of line that creates a <strong>long relational rhythm</strong>. Additionally, the way the <strong>head sweeps into the upper arm</strong> is an elegant line, and I might not typically emphasize it in my approach.</p>

<p>These unique sensibilities offer me new ways to think about <strong>organization of line and rhythm</strong>.</p>

<h3>"About to" Poses and Engaging the Viewer</h3>

<p>Some of Rodin's poses feel like an <strong>"about to" pose</strong>, where something is about to happen. This kind of pose is great to aim for in drawings because it engages the viewer's imagination. They invest in what's taking place or what's not taking place.</p>

<p>For example, a figure might appear out of balance with the <strong>center of gravity</strong> shifted, suggesting motion or action. Adjusting the pose to clarify weight distribution can enhance the <strong>sense of movement</strong>.</p>

<h2>Exploring Character Archetypes Through Gesture</h2>

<p>Looking at <strong>Kratos</strong> from "God of War," I see similarities to Abby's severe pose but with distinct differences that reflect his character.</p>

<h3>Body Language and Shape Language</h3>

<p>Kratos' pose feels <strong>coiled up</strong>, ready to strike. His <strong>head is buried in the shoulders</strong>, and his stance is confrontational. The shape language consists of <strong>triangles and boxes</strong>, contributing to a <strong>badass state</strong>.</p>

<p>This ties back to the <strong>anti-hero archetype</strong>, where sharp angles and boxes are prevalent. The severe balancing of weight and the use of symmetry make his pose feel intense and unforgiving.</p>

<h3>Transformation of Characters</h3>

<p>Kratos evolves into the <strong>reluctant father archetype</strong>, similar to Joel in "The Last of Us." His pose might soften, showing a more <strong>fatherly framing</strong> with perhaps slightly softer shapes. The inclusion of his son introduces <strong>asymmetry</strong> and a more <strong>optimistic, carefree</strong> vibe.</p>

<p>By studying these changes, I see how <strong>gesture reflects character development</strong> and how subtle adjustments in pose can communicate different aspects of a character.</p>

<h2>Organizing the Body into Categories of Emotion</h2>

<p>After doing numerous gesture studies, it becomes apparent that the body can be <strong>organized into categories of emotion</strong>. This concept aligns with <strong>Will Eisner's micro-dictionary of gestures</strong>, where he understood and utilized the idea that the body consistently displays certain cues when expressing emotions like anger or deceit.</p>

<p>It's a fascinating idea that the body has a vocabulary of its own, and by studying and analyzing gestures, we can tap into that language to enhance our storytelling and character designs.</p>
