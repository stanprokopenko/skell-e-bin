<p><strong>Kim Jung Gi</strong> could fill entire walls with intricate, fast drawings done completely from imagination. He didn’t use grids he could see on the paper. Instead, everything he drew was constructed from <strong>three-dimensional boxes in his mind</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>How Did Kim Jung Gi Do It?</strong></p>

<p>He explained his method during a live demo with a translator:</p>

<ul>

<li>All his drawing starts with boxes.</li>

<li>After he understood the three-dimensional box, his improvement accelerated.</li>

<li>Even for highly complicated images, he visualized them as boxes first.</li>

<li>The entire scene was planned in his mind using boxes.</li>

<li>He imagined the horizon line, even if he didn’t draw it.</li>

<li>Each box stood in for a different part of the scene (for example, “this guy in the front” vs. “the big one in the back”), with the big images being set in mental boxes so he could pull them out while drawing.</li>

</ul>

<p><strong>Breaking Down Complex Scenes</strong></p>

<p>No matter the complexity, Kim Jung Gi would:</p>

<ul>

<li>Break the scene into basic box shapes inside a larger “big box.”</li>

<li>Use his understanding of the three-dimensional box to confidently reconstruct any part of the scene.</li>

<li>Start with a single drawn box, from there he could build out the entire composition on the paper.</li>

</ul>

<p><strong>The Box, Not the Grid</strong></p>

<p>There’s a theme in Kim Jung Gi’s explanations:</p>

<ul>

<li>He emphasizes the <strong>box</strong>, or sometimes the <strong>cube</strong>, over and over.</li>

<li>He doesn’t use traditional perspective grids.</li>

<li>The foundation for his scenes is the <strong>conceptual box</strong>, not drawn guidelines.</li>

</ul>

<p><strong>Visualizing the Scene</strong></p>

<p>Mentally, he kept track of:</p>

<ul>

<li>Where the horizon line was, even if invisible.</li>

<li>The spatial organization of boxes for all objects in the scene.</li>

<li>Relationships and overlaps between these boxes, allowing complex scenes to unfold logically.</li>

</ul>

<p><strong>Studying Subjects from Multiple Views</strong></p>

<p>Kim Jung Gi stressed the need to observe your subject <strong>from more than one angle</strong>:</p>

<ul>

<li>If you want to draw a cat, dog, airplane, or anything else, you need to look at it objectively from all sides.</li>

<li>Orthographic drawings (from the front, side, and top) help you understand these forms, and they serve as mental reference points later.</li>

</ul>

<p><strong>Advice from Kim Jung Gi on Perspective</strong></p>

<p>I got to ask him if “box” just meant “cube.” Here’s what I learned:</p>

<ul>

<li>It doesn’t have to be a cube, <strong>any box shape works</strong>.</li>

<li>Early on, he could only put one object in a box. With practice, he could put the whole space into a conceptual box.</li>

<li>When drawing, he’s always aware of <strong>height, width, and depth</strong> in that imaginary space.</li>

<li>He pays special attention to <strong>relationships</strong>: the connections between the person in front, the person next to them, and so on. These spatial relationships let him create stories inside his scenes.</li>

<li>As the space takes shape, more elements and narrative possibilities appear.</li>

</ul>

<p><strong>Encouragement for Artists</strong></p>

<p>Having shared Kim Jung Gi’s process at Kazone Art Academy in 2016, my hope is to encourage you:</p>

<ul>

<li>Take on the demanding work ahead.</li>

<li>Build your skill step by step.</li>

<li>Practicing this box method and dedicating yourself to understanding space can help you draw with the same confident freedom.</li>

</ul>

<p><strong>Remember:</strong> If you can visualize and draw the box, you can build anything within it.</p>
