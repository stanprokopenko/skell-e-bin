<h2>Learning to Draw is Easier Than You Think</h2>

<p>Learning to draw anything is actually a lot easier than you might think. By starting with simple shapes and lines, you can begin to create complex forms without feeling overwhelmed.</p>

<h2>Using Simple Lines and Shapes to Create Form</h2>

<h3>Starting with a C-Curve</h3>

<p>Take a look at a <strong>C-curve</strong>, just a single line. By adding another C-curve right next to it and then adding <strong>wrapping lines</strong>, you can start simulating the idea of form. This simple technique is one of the first building blocks to learning how to draw people.</p>

<h3>Building Blocks for Drawing People</h3>

<p>Using basic shapes like <strong>cylinders</strong>, you can manipulate and change them to pretty much draw anything. For example, you can take the idea of a C-curve and start creating a character from that. By using wrapping lines and C-curves, you can quickly create a more complex shape that's figurative almost instantly.</p>

<h2>Creating Complex Forms from Simple Shapes</h2>

<h3>The Importance of Primitive Shapes</h3>

<p>By adding some basic primitive shapes underneath your initial lines, you can start creating the idea of the <strong>bean</strong> or a <strong>rib cage and pelvis</strong>. This relationship allows you to extrude and create everything off of that foundation. The same idea works for the arms and legs.</p>

<h3>Introducing Anatomy at the Right Time</h3>

<p>At a certain point in your drawing, you can start injecting <strong>anatomy</strong> to emphasize the idea of wrapping lines. Using anatomy as wrapping lines helps wrap around the form, rather than adding wrapping lines arbitrarily. It's almost like a stylistic choice, but using anatomy can make it look better.</p>

<h2>Simplifying Shapes for Better Rendering and Storytelling</h2>

<p>When you begin to understand how to simplify your shapes, the idea of rendering and adding structure to your artwork becomes a lot simpler. You're using small building blocks to create a larger picture over time, rather than trying to make something complex all at once.</p>

<h2>Rendering Techniques</h2>

<p>When it comes to rendering, use a simplified light source. Treating your form like an <strong>egg</strong>, you can start rendering it in the same way you'd render a <strong>cylinder</strong> or a <strong>sphere</strong>. This approach helps your drawing come together as a more rendered object.</p>

<h2>Using Anatomy to Enhance Form</h2>

<p>Think of anatomy as an excuse to <strong>push the form</strong>. You're considering the underlying structure, almost like the physics of what's happening. Just because you know what the <strong>brachioradialis</strong> is doesn't mean you have to include it. Use anatomy to serve the form, not to complicate it.</p>

<h2>The Importance of Simplicity and Intuition</h2>

<p>By keeping things as <strong>simple</strong> as possible, you're more likely to think of solutions and solve problems because they're so simple. It's almost like making it <strong>idiot-proof</strong>.</p>

<h2>Exercises to Improve</h2>

<p>One great exercise is to draw some basic shapes. Just drawing <strong>circles</strong> and relating things back and forth is a good place to start. It gets your arm used to putting shapes down.</p>

<h3>Drawing with Your Arm, Not Your Wrist</h3>

<p>When you're drawing, try not to draw with your <strong>wrist</strong>. Instead, draw with your <strong>arm</strong>. Throw your arm in a way that puts as much <strong>energy</strong> in there as possible.</p>

<h2>Embracing Intuition in Drawing</h2>

<p>Studying this stuff has a lot more to do with letting yourself be more <strong>intuitive</strong>. This way of drawing isn't the only one, but it's a method that is really intuitive. None of it is really logical. That C-shape and then adding form, you might think there's some logic there, but it's mostly intuitive. You're letting your mind go from one step to the other, without overthinking the exact logic or perspective.</p>

<h2>Advice for Beginners</h2>

<p>There's a time and place to be very precise with what you're doing, but it's not always best for beginners to be precise at the beginning. If you could go back and advise your younger self, it wouldn't necessarily be to learn all the muscles or perspective. It would be to try to be more <strong>intuitive</strong>.</p>

<p>A knowledge-based approach will progress you, but it's not going to be the thing that helps you find the exact <strong>style of art</strong> you want to be doing.</p>

<h2>Understanding Gesture</h2>

<p>The idea of <strong>gesture</strong> is a lot more <strong>subjective</strong> than it is objective. A lot of this stuff is based on your opinion. When you start a drawing, you're throwing in rough approximations of things and bringing them in to represent more specific ideas. That ability to just start throwing down shapes and seeing what happens will eventually turn into those things becoming form and shape and something more representational.</p>
