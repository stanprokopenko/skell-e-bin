<p>In this critique session for lesson group four of the Proko perspective course, we'll review some of your submissions and discuss key concepts like <strong>blobbing</strong>, moving from <strong>blobs to boxes</strong>, <strong>foreshortening</strong>, and more. While we can't cover every piece here, make sure to check out all the submissions in our community posts.</p>

<h2>Understanding Blobbing and Blobs to Boxes</h2>

<h3>Andrus: First Attempt at Blobbing</h3>

<p>Andrus, great job on your first attempt at blobbing. You're working with three sets of lines:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Left to right lines</strong></li>

<li><strong>Up and down lines</strong></li>

<li><strong>Front to back lines</strong></li>

</ul>

<p>When you're unsure where lines go, remember they follow the <strong>front to back lines</strong>. Every line will stop where it hits the <strong>up and down lines</strong>, tuck under, and go in the appropriate direction. <strong>Blocking</strong> simplifies forms to these three sets of lines, making it easier to manage.</p>

<h3>Par: Blobs to Boxes</h3>

<p>Par, you've done a very good job transitioning from blobs to boxes. The goal here isn't refinement but to get started by simplifying complex shapes into basic forms. This exercise helps you understand how to break down objects into manageable pieces.</p>

<h2>Foreshortening and Moving Blobs Around</h2>

<h3>Josh Drummond's Airplanes</h3>

<p>Josh, you did exactly the right thing by trying different positions and not getting bogged down by unnecessary details like proportions or vanishing points. You focused on <strong>foreshortening</strong>, which was the main point. Your studies show how <strong>big forms</strong> relate to <strong>secondary</strong> and <strong>tertiary forms</strong>, which is impressive.</p>

<h3>Andreas: Moving Blobs Around</h3>

<p>Andreas, you moved blobs around and turned them into boxes, creating impressive shapes with bent forms and ellipses. You've gone beyond the call of duty by exploring <strong>diminution</strong> and <strong>extreme foreshortening</strong>. Your diagrams show complex forms in various perspectives, which is excellent.</p>

<h2>Advanced Hints on Foreshortening</h2>

<p>When you look directly at a form, it can be challenging to perceive its 3D nature. As you change your viewpoint, moving above, below, or to the side, planes will <strong>foreshorten</strong> and <strong>curve</strong> differently. For example, as you move above an object, the curves and ellipses change due to foreshortening. Don't worry about perfecting this now, but be aware of how rapidly things foreshorten in extreme positions.</p>

<h2>Transitioning from Blobs to Boxes</h2>

<h3>RDP Man: Drawing Objects from Blobs</h3>

<p>RDP Man, you stayed focused on drawing objects from blobs without jumping ahead, which is great. Even though the fan was difficult and looked weird to you, it's because a fan is complex with cylinders within cylinders and carved-out portions. <strong>Boxy</strong> shapes are better for this exercise. Keep practicing, and you'll build confidence.</p>

<h3>Maria: Difficulty with Transitioning</h3>

<p>Maria, you mentioned finding the transition from blob to box harder than just working with blobs or boxes separately. It looks like you've grasped the concept in your drawings. Try visualizing the planes of the object by:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Separating areas with lines</strong></li>

<li>Simplifying complex curves into flat planes that connect</li>

</ul>

<p>This helps in seeing the <strong>box within the blob</strong>.</p>

<h2>Overlaps and Squash and Stretch</h2>

<p>When <strong>fleshy</strong> or <strong>blobular forms</strong> bend, one side <strong>stretches</strong> while the other <strong>squashes</strong>. This concept adds a sense of realism to simple forms. In perspective, this means the closer portion of a form <strong>overlaps</strong> the further part, enhancing the illusion of depth. <strong>Exploiting overlaps</strong> can help convey how a form moves back in space.</p>

<h2>Favoritism for Existing Lines</h2>

<h3>Kahn: Sticking to Initial Lines</h3>

<p>Kahn, you mentioned having a tendency to stick too rigidly to the lines you've already drawn, even if they're not quite right. This is common. Remember, you don't have to stick with initial lines. The <strong>blob-to-box approach</strong> is meant to help you gain control over rough placements without being constrained by initial marks.</p>

<h2>Student Helping Others</h2>

<h3>Amu's Teaching Page</h3>

<p>Amu, thank you for stepping in and providing a teaching page that shows the blob-to-box process with explanations. Helping fellow students understand concepts contributes to everyone's learning experience. <strong>Sharing knowledge</strong> enhances our community.</p>

<h2>Concerns About Proportions</h2>

<h3>Andreas, Negla, and Jayoshi</h3>

<p>Some of you were concerned with proportions, vanishing points, and other advanced concepts. For this lesson, we weren't focusing on those elements. <strong>Proportion</strong> will be covered in lesson group eight. The goal here was to work with <strong>foreshortening</strong> and <strong>simplifying forms</strong>. So, don't worry about getting proportions perfect right now.</p>

<h3>Negla and Jayoshi: Overemphasis on Proportions</h3>

<p>Both of you did excellent work but spent more time on proportions than necessary. For now, focus on controlling how to <strong>sculpt forms in space</strong>, and we'll address proportions in later lessons. Your efforts are commendable, and you're building a strong foundation.</p>

<h2>Daring to Foreshorten</h2>

<h3>Raylan: Foreshortening Complex Forms</h3>

<p>Raylan, you dared to foreshorten challenging objects like a lock and did well. Foreshortening <strong>toruses</strong> or loops can be tough. Remember to consider <strong>overlaps</strong> and how lines converge to enhance the illusion of depth. Your willingness to tackle these forms is impressive.</p>

<h2>Other Students' Contributions</h2>

<h3>SleepyTimeJunior: Playing with Blobs</h3>

<p>Even if you didn't fully understand the lesson, your work shows a strong grasp of adding form to blobs. Sometimes, not overthinking and just doing can lead to great results.</p>

<h3>Stiller: Complex Blobs</h3>

<p>Stiller, you took on a complex object and managed to convey <strong>overlaps</strong> effectively. Emphasizing overlaps helps communicate which parts of the object are closer to the viewer.</p>

<h3>DeeDee: Concavity in Blobs</h3>

<p>DeeDee, you asked about concave forms and why they can result in straight lines when concave both ways. Yes, concave curves can cancel each other out, appearing as <strong>straight lines</strong> at certain viewing angles, especially on spheres.</p>

<h3>Apache: Daring to Foreshorten</h3>

<p>Apache, you took on extreme foreshortening challenges. Drawing a complex object in such a perspective is daring, and you've done a great job. Keep pushing your boundaries.</p>

<h3>Rachel Dawn Owens: Helping Others</h3>

<p>Rachel, thank you for assisting other students by demonstrating concepts clearly. Your example of going from <strong>simple to complex</strong> forms helps others understand the progression.</p>

<h3>Brandon: Combining Curves and Boxes</h3>

<p>Brandon, your work on the clock includes curves at the corners while maintaining the <strong>box structure</strong>. Studying how you integrated blobs and boxes is beneficial. Your sagittal bicycle drawing shows advanced understanding.</p>

<h3>Vera Robson's Duck</h3>

<p>Vera, your duck succeeds on every level. You've accurately used the planes, <strong>transverse</strong>, <strong>coronal</strong>, and <strong>sagittal</strong>, to define the form. Your application of overlaps and contours conveys depth effectively. This is <strong>remarkable work</strong>.</p>

<h3>Other Notable Works</h3>

<ul>

<li><strong>Angelica</strong>: Continuing to work on the exercise because you <strong>enjoy</strong> it will naturally lead to improvement.</li>

<li><strong>Daniela</strong>: Choosing subjects that interest you, like <strong>armor</strong>, keeps you engaged and helps you tackle complex forms.</li>

<li><strong>Joseph McGillicott</strong>: Your beetle drawing shows detailed understanding and creativity.</li>

<li><strong>Apache</strong>: Again, taking on challenging foreshortening exercises demonstrates your dedication.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Looking Ahead</h2>

<p>We're moving towards understanding <strong>proportions</strong> and <strong>precision</strong> in future lessons. For now, focus on practicing with blobs, boxes, and foreshortening. <strong>Enjoy the process</strong>, choose subjects that interest you, and don't worry about perfection.</p>

<p>In the upcoming lessons, we'll cover:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Phil Dimitriadis' Melted Pancakes Approach</strong>: If blobs aren't clicking for you, this method might help.</li>

<li><strong>Extruding Your Name in Space</strong>: A fun exercise to apply what you've learned and create something to show off.</li>

<li><strong>No Point Perspective</strong>: Understanding <strong>orthographic projections</strong> deeply.</li>

<li><strong>Three Line Systems</strong>: Exploring how complex they can become.</li>

<li><strong>Grids and Vanishing Points</strong>: Developing an eye to estimate proportions.</li>

<li><strong>Choosing Eye Level and Projecting Exact Proportions</strong>: Planning precise projections.</li>

</ul>

<p>Your time for precision and proportion will come. For now, keep practicing, stay engaged, and continue sharing your work and supporting each other.</p>

<p><strong>See you soon!</strong></p>
