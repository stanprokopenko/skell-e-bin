<h2>Drawing Diggers: Side and Front Views</h2>

<p>To draw diggers, start by looking at them and sketching a <strong>side view</strong>. Then, draw a <strong>front view</strong> to see where the boom, arm, and bucket are positioned left to right.</p>

<h2>Using Blobs to Create 3D Forms</h2>

<p>Next, use a <strong>blob</strong> to represent the digger in three dimensions. The front end of the blob is closest to you, representing the front of the digger. To define the form:</p>

<ul>

<li>Wrap a <strong>rubber band</strong> around the blob. This helps establish the orientation.</li>

<li><strong>Slice off the front plane</strong> to make it clear where the front is.</li>

</ul>

<p>If the top part is closer to you, do the same:</p>

<ul>

<li>Wrap a rubber band around the top.</li>

<li>Slice off the top plane.</li>

</ul>

<p>The point is, if a <strong>corner is closest</strong> to you, the lines that go away to your right and left <strong>go up to your right and left</strong>. This is useful information, and the rubber band helps you visualize it.</p>

<h2>Slicing Planes and Understanding Perspective</h2>

<p>Using rubber bands and slicing planes might seem like the long way around, but it's a way to get a <strong>three-dimensional form</strong> to sculpt into. Starting with a blob in position gives you a general placement, helping you know where the front, side, and top are.</p>

<h2>Drawing Diggers from Different Angles</h2>

<p>Try drawing a digger from an <strong>up view</strong>, as if it's floating above you. Begin with a blob:</p>

<ul>

<li>The end closest to you is the front.</li>

<li>Draw the <strong>equatorial lines</strong> to define the sides and underbelly.</li>

</ul>

<p>These lines <strong>aim down to your left and right</strong>, determining the perspective. We first do it generally, then gradually learn to do it <strong>precisely</strong>.</p>

<h2>Exploring Multiple Vanishing Points</h2>

<p>Consider the platform and cabin of the digger:</p>

<ul>

<li>They might be lined up, but what if they're not?</li>

<li>You can place the platform in <strong>two-point perspective</strong> and have the cabin aim right at you in <strong>one-point perspective</strong>.</li>

<li>Alternatively, both can be in one-point, or both in two-point with different sets of points.</li>

</ul>

<p>This shows that a picture doesn't have to be in just one or two-point perspective. <strong>Things spin</strong> in reality, and each object can have its own vanishing points.</p>

<h2>The Limits of Blobs</h2>

<p>Blobs aren't very precise, and they may give you trouble when placing characters into environments. For example, a character's feet might not look right without a <strong>grid on the ground</strong>. Drawing a block of ground with a more open grid helps position the character correctly.</p>

<h2>Combining Forms in a Scene</h2>

<p>Remember that:</p>

<ul>

<li>The street, the digger, and the character's feet can each be their own <strong>individual unit</strong>.</li>

<li><strong>Cartoonists and animators</strong> often use blobs.</li>

<li><strong>Upper body, lower body, limbs, and even fingers</strong> can go in different directions.</li>

</ul>

<p>Wrapping a <strong>rubber band around each shape</strong> turns it into a form. That's the <strong>Looney Tunes maxim</strong>: **"Put a striped sock on everything, you can take it off later." ** It makes it clear whether a blob is coming toward you or going away.</p>

<h2>Creating Characters and Sketching Ideas</h2>

<p>If you feel like creating characters, <strong>sketch all sorts of crazy ideas</strong>. Don't give up out of fear that the first idea might not be perfect. If you're not sure about the shape:</p>

<ul>

<li>Put it in a <strong>pure front view</strong> or <strong>pure side view</strong>.</li>

<li>Maybe even draw the <strong>back, top, and bottom</strong>.</li>

<li><strong>Make a little orthographic drawing</strong> to force decisions about the shape.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Understanding Perspective in Cartoons</h2>

<p>Not sure about tumbling the character? Some cartoonists prefer not to have too much perspective in their work. They feel that once you begin to draw <strong>sophisticatedly</strong>, it's hard to return to <strong>naive drawing</strong>. They're correct.</p>

<p>However, even if it's hard to get into naive mode when you know too much, it's harder to use something you never learned how to use. Personally, I like cartoons that <strong>use perspective</strong>. Early 20th-century cartoonists almost all worked in this tradition. They had the skills that you're working on here, and this is one of them.</p>

<h2>Next Steps</h2>

<p>Next, we'll <strong>turn some blobs into boxes</strong> and draw airplanes.</p>
