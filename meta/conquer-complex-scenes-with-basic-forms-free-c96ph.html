<h2>What's in Premium?</h2>

<p>Learn how to simplify complex structures in your drawings by breaking them down into big simple forms. Focus on the overall composition, considering elements like color, line, and shape. Understand how to think in terms of three-dimensional structures—macro, mid-level, and micro—and recognize when to prioritize technical accuracy or aesthetics. Discover how to work in stages, starting with loose sketches before adding details, and how to see like a cinematographer by studying lenses and proximity.</p>
