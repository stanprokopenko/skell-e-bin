<p>I'm going to draw an orthographic projection of <strong>little Blake's cottage</strong>. This involves creating the <strong>front view</strong>, <strong>top view</strong>, and <strong>side view</strong> of the cottage. By the end of this exercise, we'll have a detailed representation of the cottage from multiple angles.</p>

<h2>Drawing the Front View</h2>

<p>I begin by sketching a general <strong>square shape</strong> for the main part of the house. Next to it, I add a <strong>little side shed</strong>, aligning it with the main structure.</p>

<h3>Drawing the Roof</h3>

<p>I estimate the space for the <strong>roof</strong>, making sure it's <strong>equal on either side</strong>. I darken the lines to show that the roof is indeed wider than the house. This will serve as the <strong>front view</strong> of the cottage.</p>

<h3>Placing the Door</h3>

<p>To place a <strong>door</strong> right in the center, I find the center by drawing an <strong>X from corner to corner</strong>, an old trick to quickly locate the middle point. I mark the height of the door with tick marks, and estimate it to look proportionate.</p>

<h3>Adding Pots for Plants</h3>

<p>I decide to add a couple of <strong>pots for plants</strong> out front. I line them up, making sure they're <strong>pretty much centered</strong>. I'm eyeballing it, but it looks accurate. These pots are miniature versions of the door, perhaps not quite as tall since they'll have plants on them.</p>

<h3>Adjusting on the Fly</h3>

<p>As I design, I make choices on the fly. This involves estimating proportions and making adjustments as needed.</p>

<h2>Adjusting the Shed Roof</h2>

<p>I notice that the <strong>shed roof</strong> is as tall as the main house roof. I decide to <strong>lower it</strong> to create a more pleasing design.</p>

<p>I quickly adjust the <strong>height of the shed roof</strong>, bringing it down slightly. Working in pencil makes these changes easy.</p>

<h2>Drawing the Top View</h2>

<p>To show the <strong>depth</strong> of the house, I need to create a <strong>top view</strong>.</p>

<h3>Flipping the Drawing</h3>

<p>I imagine flipping the house to look <strong>down on it</strong>. All the <strong>width lines</strong> remain the same, so I draw <strong>vertical lines</strong> from the important features of the front view.</p>

<h3>Establishing the Front Wall</h3>

<p>I decide to place the <strong>front wall</strong> in the top view close to the edge to save space. The width of the roof remains consistent.</p>

<h3>Determining the Roof's Center</h3>

<p>To find the <strong>center of the roof</strong> in the top view, I measure the width and find the halfway point. An easy way to do this is by marking the ends on a piece of paper, folding it to match the marks, and finding the center crease.</p>

<h3>Drawing the House and Pots</h3>

<p>I outline the <strong>house</strong> in the top view, making it clear where the walls and roof are. For the <strong>pots</strong>, I place them in front of the house, ensuring they're properly aligned.</p>

<h2>Drawing the Side View</h2>

<p>Now, I'll create the <strong>side view</strong> to show the <strong>height</strong> and <strong>depth</strong>.</p>

<h3>Transferring Heights</h3>

<p>I transfer the <strong>heights</strong> from the front view by drawing horizontal lines across. This ensures that all the heights remain consistent.</p>

<h3>Aligning Features</h3>

<p>I align the peaks of the roofs from the front view to the side view. This means the <strong>peaks</strong> will line up vertically.</p>

<h3>Determining Depths</h3>

<p>I use the top view to transfer the <strong>depth measurements</strong> to the side view. By projecting lines from the top view, I can accurately place the features in the side view.</p>

<h3>Adjusting the Shed Depth</h3>

<p>I make a decision about how far back the shed extends. I want the <strong>roof peaks</strong> of the shed and the main house to align vertically, so I adjust the depth accordingly.</p>

<h2>Connecting the Views</h2>

<p>With all three views, the front, top, and side, I can ensure that all elements of the cottage are accurately represented.</p>

<h3>Using Projections</h3>

<p>I use <strong>projection lines</strong> to transfer measurements between views. This includes heights, widths, and depths.</p>

<h3>Adjusting Angles and Dimensions</h3>

<p>As I connect the dots, I adjust angles and dimensions as needed to ensure everything aligns properly. If something doesn't look right, I make the necessary changes.</p>

<h2>Finalizing the Drawing</h2>

<h3>Adding Details</h3>

<p>I add details to the drawing, such as <strong>texture to the roofs</strong>, perhaps giving them a thatched appearance. I might even add a little <strong>hand-drawn wiggle</strong> to suggest texture.</p>

<h3>Ensuring Consistency</h3>

<p>In <strong>orthographic projections</strong>, it's important that dimensions remain consistent across views. I resist the temptation to add perspective distortions.</p>

<p>By creating these three views, the front, top, and side, we can deduce most of the structure of Blake's cottage. Orthographic projections provide a clear and accurate representation of the object from multiple angles.</p>
