<h2>Setting Up the Horizon</h2>

<p>I start by placing a <strong>low-level horizon line</strong> so I can see buildings receding upward. The grid I use has <strong>vanishing points</strong> that curve my guidelines. I place an <strong>axis line</strong> running up the middle to guide the center. When you’re drawing an upshot, you have to look up at the structures, so the horizon must stay low.</p>

<p>I block in a simple grid with light curves leading to my vanishing points. Then I reduce my initial sketch’s opacity so I can draw on top with more refined lines. </p>

<h2>Blocking In Buildings</h2>

<p>I always want to see at least two sides of a building. If I put a structure directly over the axis line, it flattens. I either move it left or right so we see its side plane. </p>

<p>When I start drawing a house in four-point perspective:</p>

<p>• I pull lines from the building’s corners back to the center vanishing point.<br />

• The tops and bottoms curve toward the left and right vanishing points.<br />

• By shifting the building slightly off-center, I reveal a side plane that adds depth.</p>

<h3>Varying Building Height</h3>

<p>To reinforce scale, smaller buildings often go on the outer edges of the sketch, and larger buildings sit in the middle. Medieval buildings sometimes start with a narrow base and expand outward on each floor. If I want a tall structure, I often give it a higher roof rather than extending the walls too high. This prevents extreme leaning.</p>

<h2>Overlaps and Scale</h2>

<p>I like overlapping shapes to build depth. Hills or raised platforms under buildings create levels of interest. When you’re drawing a scene with many buildings:</p>

<p>• Use <strong>overlapping</strong> to show distance.<br />

• Vary the <strong>roof styles</strong> (flat, triangular, sagging).<br />

• Consider <strong>platforms or steps</strong> on hillsides.</p>

<p>I also plot <strong>characters</strong> to check scale. A person near the foreground is large, and the same person placed farther back shrinks along the perspective lines.</p>

<h2>Adding Castle Walls</h2>

<p>This upshot view is perfect for <strong>castles</strong>. Castles often have perimeter walls and multiple lookout towers. I start by plotting a <strong>protective wall</strong> curving back to the horizon point. Then I add <strong>towers</strong> or <strong>lookouts</strong> with steep angles that converge to the center vanishing point.</p>

<p>If I keep the shapes basic, mostly squared or rectangular, my perspective stays solid. Round towers are possible, but I need to handle ellipses carefully.</p>

<h2>Roads, Details, and Props</h2>

<p>Wide, curving roads give a town-like feel. Paths, cobblestone, and stairs fill negative space. Near buildings, I might add <strong>carts, barrels, crates, or market stalls</strong>. These objects help show depth and make the scene believable.</p>

<h2>Clouds Above</h2>

<p>Clouds also follow the same <strong>curving perspective</strong>. Since we’re looking up, I picture clouds with an <strong>under-plane</strong> visible. The largest, closest clouds sit near the top edges of the frame, curving to the vanishing points. As they recede, they get smaller and line up in perspective. Showing highlights on one side and shadow on the underside boosts their dimension.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p>By thinking about <strong>axis lines</strong>, <strong>curving perspective guides</strong>, and <strong>plenty of overlap</strong>, I create a cohesive upshot. Smaller buildings on the sides, bigger structures in the middle, and carefully placed details keep the sketch interesting, unified, and three-dimensional.</p>
