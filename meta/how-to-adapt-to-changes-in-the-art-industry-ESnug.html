<h2>The State of the Art Industry</h2>

<p>In 2009, animation students were worried about layoffs and the economy. Despite initial fears, many students had successful careers. During the pandemic, animators had more work than ever. Recently, the industry has shifted again, making it hard to predict future trends.</p>

<p>The gallery world also faced challenges during economic downturns. The internet has become a significant platform for selling art, supplementing galleries. Some high-end galleries and artists still thrive, but it's a small percentage. Many artists no longer rely solely on galleries. The art industry has shifted, but artists have adapted.</p>

<p>Economic shifts happen regularly, and artists must be resourceful and adaptable. Society's promises about education and job security can be misleading, especially in the art world. The art industry is competitive and often low-paying. It's challenging to predict if things will improve, as historical events like the Great Depression show.</p>

<p>The key question is how to make a living as an artist now, which has many answers depending on individual circumstances. There is no single formula for success; artists must navigate their unique situations. The art industry will not disappear, despite fears about automation and AI. The arts will continue to exist, and people will still create and appreciate art.</p>

<h2>Economic Impacts on Artists</h2>

<p>In 2009, animation students were worried about layoffs and the economy. Despite these fears, many students had successful careers. During the pandemic, animators had more work than ever. Recently, the industry has shifted again, making it hard to predict future trends.</p>

<p>Economic shifts happen regularly, and artists must be resourceful and adaptable. Historical events like the Great Depression show that it's challenging to predict if things will improve. The economy is cyclical, and a recession is inevitable at some point. The difference between having a career and a job is significant when economic shifts occur.</p>

<h2>The Role of the Internet</h2>

<p>The internet has become a <strong>significant platform for selling art</strong>, supplementing traditional galleries. While some high-end galleries and artists still thrive, it's a small percentage. Many artists no longer rely solely on galleries for their income.</p>

<p><strong>Online education</strong> is on the rise because it doesn't create debt and empowers students to choose their courses. This shift is partly due to the high cost of traditional art schools and the underpayment of teachers. Online education offers flexibility and accessibility, making it a popular choice for many aspiring artists.</p>

<p>The shift from traditional galleries to online sales has been a major change in the art industry. Artists have adapted to these changes by leveraging the internet to reach a broader audience and sell their work directly to consumers.</p>

<h2>Personal Experiences and Advice</h2>

<p>Creating art for money can be less fulfilling than creating for personal satisfaction. I don't want to sell my paintings; I just enjoy the process of painting. Selling my art ruins the joy of painting for me. I feel hurt when I don't want to paint anymore because it's a big part of me. For money, I'd rather do something else.</p>

<p>My career has been primarily as a business owner and teacher. Not everyone is inclined to be a business owner. Every artist should think of themselves as a brand and a small business. Reputation is important among both the public and peers. Some artists are not entrepreneurs but can be valuable team members.</p>

<h2>Adaptability and Mental Strength</h2>

<p>Preparing for worst-case scenarios, like not making a living as an artist, is important. If your career as an artist fails, it doesn't mean your life is over. Consider alternative ways to support your art, like having another source of income. Remedios Varo, a surrealist painter, thrived with the support of another person. Focus on creating good art without the pressure of selling everything. Worst-case scenarios can sometimes feel liberating.</p>

<p>People who have had it rough and fought for success may be better prepared for difficult times. Students who found things easy early on may struggle more when faced with real-world challenges. Being too comfortable can be a disadvantage; it's important to prepare for difficult times. Intentionally experiencing discomfort, like ice baths, can build mental strength. Controlled pain, like exercise, can be beneficial without breaking you.</p>

<p>Andrew Huberman, a responsible celebrity health doctor, emphasizes the importance of doing your own research. Ice baths can help develop mental strength and prepare you for dreaded tasks. Facing physical discomfort can help you handle emotional challenges. Practicing things you don't want to do can build resilience. Mental strength is crucial for getting through difficult times. Being ready for life both physically and mentally is important. Losing weight can empower you to take more risks and achieve other goals. Facing a cold plunge can be analogous to facing unemployment.</p>

<h2>The Future of the Art Industry</h2>

<p>There are fears about <strong>automation and AI</strong> in the art industry, with predictions that 90% of animation will be done by AI. However, historical examples show that industries often face "endings" but adapt and continue. For instance, major changes in the movie industry, like the introduction of sound and television, required adaptation. The comic book industry experienced a similar oversaturation in the early 90s.</p>

<p>Young people often drive innovation and adaptation in industries. Watching documentaries on industry history can provide perspective and encouragement. Simon Sinek's message that these are not unprecedented times emphasizes the need for re-evaluation and change. Humans are resilient and adaptable, like coyotes.</p>

<p><strong>Collaboration with humans</strong> is more meaningful than with robots. Long-term projects require human experience and desire. Robots may not completely replace human creativity and collaboration. Jeffrey Katzenberg's claim that 90% of jobs won't be done by robots is debatable, but even if it's 97%, adaptation is key. AI isn't doing 3% of the work; humans like Justin Sweet and Vance Kovacs are.</p>

<p>Justin and Vance shared their work at a community college, inspiring discouraged students. Vance showed work from a canceled movie, Mouse Guard, highlighting family dynamics and storytelling. AI lacks understanding of family dynamics and emotional storytelling. Storytelling illustrators have emotional discernment that AI lacks.</p>

<p>Don Richardson, a television director, had a 35-year career because he improved every show he worked on. Richardson adapted to different genres due to proper training and was indispensable. Smaller companies can now compete with larger ones due to easier scaling. The economy might shift to many small entities, like YouTubers supporting themselves. Everyone needs to think of themselves as part of a business. Specialization in skills will be important, similar to how sound specialists emerged in movies. Collaboration with complementary skills is crucial for success.</p>

<h2>The Importance of Community</h2>

<p>Small groups and local communities provide valuable support and interaction. There will be a pullback from social media and AI towards more human interaction. Real-world interactions and local communities will become more important.</p>

<p>An artist in New York makes a living doing street portraits, showing the value of human interaction. Marshall is excited about working with students on perspective and building a good community. Getting good at what you do will ensure there is a place for you in the world. Focus on providing value and adapting to new opportunities.</p>

<p>Personal interactions and small communities will continue to thrive. The Proko community has discussions and assignments, fostering problem-solving. Students' engagement in solving problems together benefits everyone, including the teacher.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p>Focus, dedication, and continuous learning are crucial in the art industry. Tim Ferriss dedicated five days to learning to draw, showing the value of focused learning. Personal connections, community support, and continuous learning are essential.</p>

<p>I have some healthy habits and personal preferences. I eat dark chocolate throughout the day and drink coffee two or three times a week. Coffee and dark chocolate are the only junk foods I consume. I don't measure my chocolate intake because measuring makes me cut back.</p>

<p>The ongoing conversation about the art industry highlights the importance of adaptability and resilience. The industry is always changing, and artists must be prepared for these shifts. Despite fears about automation and AI, human creativity and collaboration will continue to play a significant role. Personal interactions and small communities will thrive, providing valuable support and opportunities for artists.</p>
