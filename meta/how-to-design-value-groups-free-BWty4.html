<h2>What's in Premium?</h2>

<p>See the full demo of a cast-head drawing taken from photo reference, start to finish. I walk you through:</p>

<ul>

<li>Choosing a ground-truth measurement and blocking in proportions with light construction lines.  </li>

<li>Connecting hair, beard, and cheek with rhythmic shape design that beats strict tracing.  </li>

<li>Squint-based shadow mapping: one flat shadow mass, then targeted 6B accents only.  </li>

<li>Using charcoal powder for a controlled background gradation without mixing it into your graphite darks.  </li>

<li>Building a clean five-value structure, “drawing with the eraser” to recover crisp highlights.  </li>

<li>Managing hard, soft, and lost edges and placing background darks to frame the focal area.  </li>

<li>Knowing exactly where to stop at a strong Level-1 finish before pushing into detailed rendering.</li>

</ul>

<p>Every step is shown in real time so you can see the decision-making sequence, then apply the same stages to your own head studies.</p>
