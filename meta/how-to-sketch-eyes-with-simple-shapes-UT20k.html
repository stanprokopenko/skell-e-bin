<h2>Setting Up the Initial Sketch</h2>

<p>When I begin drawing eyes, I start by establishing the <strong>brow line</strong>. This helps me set the foundation for the rest of the features. Next, I find the <strong>vertical line</strong> down the center of the face, creating a <strong>T-shape</strong> that guides the placement of the eyes.</p>

<p>I then establish the <strong>keystone shape</strong> of the <strong>glabella</strong> between the eyebrows. From there, I can determine the <strong>eye line</strong>, which is about a third of the way down between the brow line and the base of the nose.</p>

<h2>Capturing the Tilt and Gesture</h2>

<p>One crucial aspect is paying attention to the <strong>tilt of the eyes</strong>. I use soft, light lines to connect horizontal guidelines, ensuring that any tilt or asymmetry is accurately represented. For example, one eye might be slightly higher than the other due to expression or angle.</p>

<h2>Drawing the Eyebrows and Eye Sockets</h2>

<p>With the guidelines in place, I sketch the <strong>eyebrows</strong>, noting their shape and how they relate to the glabella. I also outline the <strong>eye sockets</strong>, paying attention to the planes and edges that define the depth of the eyes within the face.</p>

<h2>Defining the Eyelids and Corners of the Eyes</h2>

<p>I locate the <strong>tear ducts</strong> (lacrimal caruncles) and the <strong>lateral corners</strong> of the eyes. Connecting these points helps me capture the eyes' shape. It's helpful to remember that the <strong>outer corner</strong> of the eye is often higher than the tear duct. I use <strong>straight lines</strong> initially to block out the shapes before refining them into curves.</p>

<p>I focus on the <strong>upper and lower eyelids</strong>, ensuring they wrap around the spherical form of the eyeball. Emphasizing the <strong>thickness</strong> of the upper eyelid adds realism to the drawing.</p>

<h2>Placing the Irises and Pupils</h2>

<p>When drawing the <strong>irises</strong>, I pay attention to the <strong>negative shapes</strong> of the sclera (the white of the eye) surrounding them. This helps me position them accurately in relation to the eyelids. I ensure the <strong>pupils</strong> are aligned and add any <strong>highlights</strong> reflected in the eyes.</p>

<h2>Adding Details and Shading</h2>

<p>I begin adding <strong>value</strong> to indicate shadows, such as the shadow cast by the upper eyelid onto the eye. I darken the <strong>pupils</strong> and add shading to the <strong>irises</strong>. For the <strong>eyelashes</strong>, I simplify them into <strong>graphic shapes</strong>, like triangular wisps, rather than drawing individual hairs. This approach creates a more appealing and readable design.</p>

<p>I refine the <strong>eyebrows</strong>, adding texture in strategic places but keeping them mostly as solid shapes. The <strong>lower eyelid</strong> often catches light on its top plane, so I highlight this area to enhance the three-dimensional form.</p>

<h2>Drawing Eyes in Profile</h2>

<p>When drawing an eye in profile, it's easier to see the <strong>spherical form</strong> of the eyeball and how the <strong>eyelids wrap around</strong> it. The eyelids and eyelashes can be represented with <strong>tapered shapes</strong> that fan out from the eye. Simplifying eyelashes into graphic shapes remains effective in profile views.</p>

<h2>Common Mistakes to Avoid</h2>

<p>A common mistake is drawing eyes with <strong>identical upper and lower eyelids</strong>, creating an unnatural almond shape. Instead, remember that the <strong>upper eyelid's apex</strong> typically favors the outer corner, while the <strong>lower eyelid's lowest point</strong> favors the inner corner, creating an asymmetrical and more natural look.</p>

<p>Also, avoid making the sclera pure white. The white of the eye is usually a <strong>neutral gray</strong> with subtle pigmentation from surrounding skin tones, and often lies in shadow due to the brows and lashes.</p>

<p>By starting with strong foundational guidelines and paying close attention to anatomical details, we can create realistic and expressive eyes. Remember to work from <strong>simple to complex</strong>, refining shapes gradually, and keep checking proportions and alignments as you progress. Practice these techniques to improve your eye drawings and add depth to your portraits.</p>
