<p>In this lesson, I dive into the <strong>part-to-part based approach</strong> to gesture drawing, inspired by Hampton's Dom Riley method. If you haven't tried your hand at this method yet, I encourage you to give it a shot with the provided images before reading further.</p>

<h2>Modifying Basic Shapes</h2>

<p>When starting with the head, I often <strong>adjust the basic shape</strong> to better match the model's features. Instead of the average head shape, I might round it out or soften certain lines to capture the <strong>unique body type</strong>. This early modification helps in pushing towards a more accurate description without turning it into caricature.</p>

<h2>Connecting Parts for Spatial Understanding</h2>

<p>Next, I focus on the neck and shoulders, ensuring they're connected in a way that <strong>makes spatial sense</strong>. I consider the <strong>overlaps and wrapping lines</strong> to establish depth and perspective. The torso is approached with gestures that reflect its lean or twist, and I might adjust its shape to reflect the model's physique, such as giving it an <strong>hourglass figure</strong>.</p>

<h2>Utilizing Perspective and Overlaps</h2>

<p>Adding <strong>perspective-driven lines</strong> across the forms helps in conveying volume. For instance, when drawing the torso, I use three light lines to represent its dimensionality. Overlaps are crucial, they show which parts are in front and which are behind. This adds to the three-dimensionality of the figure.</p>

<h2>Drawing Arms and Legs with S and C Curves</h2>

<p>When drawing limbs, I decide between using <strong>S-curves and C-curves</strong> or combining straights and curves. For example, an arm might start with an S-curve to capture its flow. I pay attention to the <strong>relationship between parts</strong>, ensuring that the upper arm connects naturally to the forearm and so on. The legs might involve arrow shapes or pinch forms, depending on their position and movement.</p>

<h2>Addressing Foreshortening by Breaking Up Parts</h2>

<p>Foreshortening can be challenging, but by <strong>breaking up the limbs into parts</strong>, such as separating the upper and lower legs, it's easier to convey depth. Shortening the length of a part and opening the wrapping lines can suggest that it's coming towards or away from the viewer.</p>

<h2>Comparing with Previous Gesture Methods</h2>

<p>I find that this part-to-part approach allows for a <strong>more deliberate and slower mindset</strong> compared to the fluidity of traditional gesture drawing. It helps in understanding the pose more deeply, especially with regards to perspective and spatial relationships. Unlike the six-line Riley figure, which I always struggled to memorize, simplifying it into tubes and shapes makes it more approachable.</p>

<h2>Practice and Self-Assessment</h2>

<p>I encourage you to practice this method and <strong>compare your attempts</strong> with mine. Pay attention to how you <strong>attach one part to the next</strong> and how the overlaps and perspectives affect the overall pose. This approach can significantly enhance your ability to set up figures quickly and accurately for more detailed drawings.</p>

<p>Remember, the key is to understand the connection between parts and how they move in space. By focusing on these relationships, you'll develop a stronger foundation in figure drawing.</p>
