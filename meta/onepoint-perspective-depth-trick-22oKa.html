<h2>Closer vs. Farther Points</h2>

<p>You’ve learned that the closer you place two vanishing points, the more the viewer feels pulled into a scene in two-point perspective. But how does that work with one-point perspective? The question is: <strong>How do you spread apart a single point?</strong> If you haven’t already, give it some thought. You can use your knowledge of plan projections or any angles you know from ProTrac as clues.</p>

<h2>From One-Point to Two-Point</h2>

<p>To control your one-point square, you need to transform it into a two-point perspective setup. Draw a square in one-point, then pull a corner toward you and another corner away. You’ll notice right angles form when you draw lines from each corner. That means you’re now essentially working in two-point perspective.</p>

<p>If you move the two vanishing points farther apart, the once “one-point” square flattens. If you move those points closer, it deepens. You’re still drawing a square, but you’re controlling how it projects into space by shifting those two points.</p>

<h2>Measuring Space with Diagonals</h2>

<p>A powerful shortcut for measuring space is to use <strong>diagonals</strong>. When you line up corners or edges diagonally, you avoid too many complicated plan projection lines. This helps you:</p>

<ul>

<li>Measure distances with more precision.  </li>

<li>Visualize space without relying on cumbersome ruler work.</li>

</ul>

<p>In other words, diagonals can do the bulk of your measuring, and you can see the depth more naturally. This skill, combined with swiveling the picture plane, gives you many ways to measure angles and distances from the floor, ceiling, or walls.</p>

<h2>Practice and Next Steps</h2>

<p>If you want this tactic to stick, keep practicing one-point squares and stretching them into two-point perspective. Notice how the change in distance between vanishing points alters the viewer’s sense of depth. In part two, you’ll see even more secrets for using diagonals and other shortcuts to measure and control your composition. For now, build a solid routine of playing with this transformation so you can visualize it at will.</p>
