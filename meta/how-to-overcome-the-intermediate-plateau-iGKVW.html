<h2>Understanding the Intermediate Plateau</h2>

<p>The <strong>intermediate plateau</strong> is a phase many artists experience. We've moved past the beginner stage, but we find ourselves <strong>stuck</strong> and <strong>not improving</strong>. It's that point where the last 5-10% of mastery feels <strong>extremely difficult</strong> to achieve. Many of us might feel we're putting in the effort, but we're not seeing the progress we'd hoped for.</p>

<h2>Common Traps That Keep Us Stuck</h2>

<h3>Frustration and Boredom</h3>

<p>Two words often come up when discussing the intermediate plateau: <strong>frustration</strong> and <strong>boredom</strong>.</p>

<ul>

<li>

<p><strong>Frustration</strong> happens when we realize we are not getting better, even though we are trying. But being frustrated can be a good sign, it means we're aware of our shortcomings and are prepared for instruction. We know there's a problem, and we are ready to fix it.</p>

</li>

<li>

<p><strong>Boredom</strong> can set in when we're not challenging ourselves. If we're always drawing the same thing, or not taking risks, we can become bored. This boredom might be a sign that we're not pushing ourselves out of our comfort zones.</p>

</li>

</ul>

<h3>Complacency</h3>

<p>Complacency is a dangerous trap. Sometimes, we're <strong>content</strong> with our current level and don't see that we're lacking in certain areas. We might think we're doing fine, but in reality, we're not advancing.</p>

<ul>

<li>It's important to be <strong>self-aware</strong> and recognize that there's always room for improvement.</li>

<li>Without acknowledging our weaknesses, we won't take the necessary steps to grow.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Developing Bad Habits</h3>

<p>Bad habits can keep us from progressing.</p>

<ul>

<li>We might be doing things <strong>consistently wrong</strong> without realizing it.</li>

<li>These habits can be difficult to break on our own.</li>

<li>Having a <strong>mentor</strong> or seeking feedback can help us identify and correct these bad habits.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Not Setting Clear Goals</h3>

<p>Without <strong>clear goals</strong>, our practice lacks direction.</p>

<ul>

<li>We might have a general idea of wanting to be a better artist, but that's not enough.</li>

<li>We need to set <strong>specific</strong> and <strong>achievable</strong> goals.</li>

<li>Clear goals help us focus our efforts and make deliberate practice possible.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Strategies to Move Beyond the Plateau</h2>

<h3>Embrace Challenges and Take Risks</h3>

<p>To grow, we need to <strong>step out of our comfort zones</strong>.</p>

<ul>

<li>Try new subjects, techniques, or mediums.</li>

<li>Be willing to <strong>experiment</strong> and <strong>fail</strong>, because failure is a part of the learning process.</li>

<li>Taking risks can reignite our passion and lead to breakthroughs.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Seek Feedback and Mentorship</h3>

<p>Having someone else evaluate our work can provide invaluable insights.</p>

<ul>

<li>A <strong>mentor</strong> can help us identify mistakes we might not see ourselves.</li>

<li>They can prioritize areas for improvement and guide us through challenges.</li>

<li>Don't underestimate the value of <strong>constructive critique</strong>.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Focus on Fundamentals</h3>

<p>It's tempting to jump ahead to the flashy techniques, but <strong>fundamentals are essential</strong>.</p>

<ul>

<li>Continually practice core skills like anatomy, perspective, and shading.</li>

<li>Even advanced artists revisit the basics to keep their skills sharp.</li>

<li>Avoid skipping ahead without solidifying these foundational elements.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Adjusting Our Mindset</h3>

<p>Our attitude towards learning can make a significant difference.</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Working in a relaxed state</strong> can facilitate growth.</li>

<li>Avoid becoming the <strong>dabbler</strong> who quits when it gets hard, the <strong>hacker</strong> who settles for good enough, or the <strong>obsessive</strong> who burns out chasing perfection.</li>

<li>Embrace a balanced approach that combines hard work with enjoyment.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Deliberate Practice with Clear Intent</h3>

<p>Practicing with <strong>intent</strong> means focusing on specific areas for improvement.</p>

<ul>

<li>Identify <strong>specific mistakes</strong> and work on correcting them.</li>

<li>Set goals like, "I want to improve my understanding of lighting within the next month."</li>

<li>Deliberate practice leads to more effective learning.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Find Inspiration and Rediscover Enjoyment</h3>

<p>Energy and enthusiasm are vital.</p>

<ul>

<li>Pursue <strong>passion projects</strong> that excite you.</li>

<li>Reconnecting with what you love about art can boost your energy levels.</li>

<li>Remember why you started creating art in the first place.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Recognize You're Not Alone</h3>

<p>Understanding that the intermediate plateau is a common experience can be reassuring.</p>

<ul>

<li>Many artists go through periods of stagnation.</li>

<li><strong>Naming the problem</strong> can help us objectify it and plan a way forward.</li>

<li>Remember that this phase can either drag us down or spark us to new heights.</li>

</ul>

<h2>When to Consider Quitting or Pivoting</h2>

<p>Sometimes, it's worth evaluating whether to continue on the same path.</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Quitting</strong> isn't always negative, it can free us to pursue something more fulfilling.</li>

<li>Alternatively, we might <strong>pivot</strong> and take a new approach or direction in our art.</li>

<li>Assessing our situation honestly can help us make the best decision for our growth.</li>

</ul>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p>Overcoming the intermediate plateau involves a combination of self-awareness, clear goal-setting, and maintaining our passion for art. By embracing challenges, seeking feedback, and focusing on deliberate practice, we can reignite our energy and continue progressing. Remember, maintaining a positive attitude and high energy levels can make all the difference in our journey to mastery.</p>
