<p><strong>We've named the axes, now let's tip them into space.</strong> I'm going to show you a device that storyboarders use that will help you with the coming lessons: <strong>arrows in every direction</strong>.</p>

<h2>The Nine Positions of Viewing an Object</h2>

<p>Let's start with a famous chart making the point that there are <strong>nine positions from which we can view an object</strong>:</p>

<ul>

<li>Directly in front of us, an <strong>ortho</strong> view</li>

<li>To our <strong>left</strong> or <strong>right</strong></li>

<li><strong>Above</strong> or <strong>below</strong></li>

<li><strong>Above</strong> to our left or right</li>

<li><strong>Below</strong> to our left or right</li>

</ul>

<p>That point is pretty much the main point this chart makes. It does not make the point that the degree of tilt could be different. You might want to learn from that.</p>

<h2>Observing How Angles Change in Perspective</h2>

<p><strong>Observe how the right angles change.</strong> When you see two planes, the front corners become <strong>acute</strong>, the back corners <strong>obtuse</strong>. When you see three planes, side angles become <strong>acute</strong> and the front and back become <strong>obtuse</strong>. Ponder that.</p>

<p>If you want to ponder seriously, try measuring the angles. But even though pondering this is good for training your eye, it doesn't explain why it happens and it isn't the point of this chart. Let's go back.</p>

<h2>Adding the Depth Axis: From Flat Shapes to Three-Dimensional Forms</h2>

<p>Another point this chart makes is that when we add the <strong>depth axis</strong>, these <strong>Z lines</strong>, it makes flat shapes thick. The X and Y lines alone only show shape. The <strong>third dimension</strong> makes it look <strong>three-dimensional</strong>.</p>

<h2>Simplifying Perspective with Basic Position Categories</h2>

<p>So what? Well, we can <strong>simplify learning perspective</strong> if we note that <strong>anything we draw is likely to be in one of these nine positions</strong>. Likely to.</p>

<p>We could angle them more extremely or include more in-between positions all the way to pure corner views if you want to ponder that, but again, it's not the reason for this chart. This chart is to show how there are only <strong>a few categories of how we can view an object</strong>.</p>

<p>And it's even simpler than we first thought. <strong>Most of these objects are repeats</strong>, flipped around, left to right or up to down. When complex challenges become simple, we sigh with relief. Then after sighing, or maybe even after memorizing these, we invite new complexity to make it a little more challenging and closer to reality.</p>

<h2>Moving from Blocks to More Complex Forms: Arrows</h2>

<p>Let's move from blocks to more complicated forms: <strong>arrows</strong>. <strong>Storyboard artists use arrows</strong> to show how something will move in the frame.</p>

<p>A flat arrow works for movement from side to side, but if the subject moves directly toward or somewhat toward or away from the camera, it takes an <strong>arrow in perspective</strong>.</p>

<h2>Creating Arrows That Show Movement in Any Direction</h2>

<p>Let me show you the simplest way to create arrows that show movement in any direction. Let's take <strong>five arrows that are perfectly flat</strong> and figure out how to make them <strong>3D</strong>.</p>

<p>Flat things are easy enough to draw. Arrows are symmetrical left to right, so if you get one side, you've got the other. But they're <strong>not symmetrical front to back</strong>. The <strong>point</strong> and <strong>tail</strong> are different, and that will give us some new complexity.</p>

<p>I duplicated these by making a template to draw the same arrow five times and see if we could do this with an <strong>ortho view</strong>. Here they are.</p>

<p>If we add another set of lines, we get a little depth. And if we duplicate them and flip them around, we can create position categories. But to tell you the truth, I'm not that thrilled with these because using ortho views is too <strong>ortho</strong>. They just need more <strong>foreshortening</strong>.</p>

<p>So, excuse me while I leap ahead with something I haven't yet fully taught you and <strong>redraw these to include foreshortening</strong>. That's better. If you care about how I did that, I'm including a separate video to explain the process.</p>

<h2>Flat Arrows vs. Oblique Arrows</h2>

<p>The <strong>flat arrow</strong> does not take perspective. It shows movement across the screen, but not toward or away from the camera, just across and up or down or any diagonal.</p>

<p><strong>Oblique arrows</strong> can point toward us, whether to left or right, above or below. We are applying what we learned from those nine blocks to a more complex object.</p>

<p>It's more complex because if these are just blocks, we only need two kinds to flip around through all the variations because they're just blocks. But an <strong>arrow's point and tail distinction</strong> requires <strong>two for the going away arrows</strong> and <strong>two more for the coming toward arrows</strong> to get all the variations.</p>

<p>So with four basic positions, we can get at least a dozen variations, and it's doable. **Arrows in every direction. ** That's all I'm showing you here, the boiled-down logic of basic positions.</p>

<h2>Reviewing the Basic Positions</h2>

<p>Let's go through them again:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Flat</strong>, not coming toward us or going away</li>

<li><strong>Coming toward us</strong></li>

<li><strong>Going away from us</strong></li>

<li><strong>Going away from us at an angle</strong></li>

<li><strong>Coming toward us at an angle</strong></li>

</ul>

<h2>Practice: Drawing Arrows in Every Direction</h2>

<p>Now here's what I recommend for you. <strong>Draw these arrows and name the positions</strong>:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Above left</strong></li>

<li><strong>Above right</strong></li>

<li><strong>Above</strong></li>

<li><strong>Below left</strong></li>

<li><strong>Below right</strong></li>

<li><strong>Below</strong></li>

<li><strong>At our left</strong></li>

<li><strong>At our right</strong></li>

</ul>

<p>Don't try to get them exact, we'll deal with that later. Instead, <strong>pay attention to the direction the X, Y, and Z lines point in each position</strong>, so that when you're sketching from imagination, you can call on these basics.</p>

<p>Whatever you draw is likely to be in one of these general positions. <strong>Get to know them.</strong> Then, when you learn how to spin forms, you can do variations of more and less tilt.</p>

<h2>Building a Foundation Before Advancing</h2>

<p>But I recommend you <strong>get your foundation</strong> before going to the next level, which in our case is <strong>placing the eye level with a horizon line</strong>.</p>

<p>To prepare for that, <strong>get your mind around these blocks and arrows</strong> enough to notice all three of their line systems and <strong>draw them roughly from memory</strong>, naming their positions. They are a shorthand that shows that something goes into or comes out of the picture.</p>
