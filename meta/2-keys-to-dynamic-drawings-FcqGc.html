<p>I like to think of <strong>art</strong> as an idea. Any idea can be art, whether it’s about beauty, politics, spirituality, or anything else. An <strong>artist</strong> is simply someone who has a particular idea about the world. And an <strong>art movement</strong> is a group of artists sharing similar ideas, like cubists or impressionists.</p>

<h2>Creativity as Connection</h2>

<p>For me, <strong>creativity</strong> is about connecting two or more separate ideas in a way that most people may not realize. You can connect:</p>

<ul>

<li>Warm and cool colors  </li>

<li>Foreground and background  </li>

<li>Light and shadow  </li>

<li>Positive and negative shapes  </li>

<li>Architectural and organic forms  </li>

</ul>

<p>Artistic strategies often revolve around finding new ways to join things that seem separate.</p>

<h2>Structure and Gesture</h2>

<p>I see <strong>structure</strong> as the separate parts of a subject, like the nose on a face, or the arm on a body. That structure can be broken down into <strong>simple shapes</strong> (triangles, eggs, boxes, tubes) or it can be turned into <strong>three-dimensional forms</strong> (spheres, cubes, cylinders).</p>

<p><strong>Gesture</strong>, on the other hand, is the life or <strong>energy</strong> in that structure. When I draw organic subjects that are mostly water, like animals or people, I want to show a fluid, watery quality in the lines.</p>

<h3>Structure</h3>

<p>• Structure is mechanical and architectural.<br />

• It can be as simple as a single shape or as detailed as a carved, nuanced form.<br />

• Structural thinking gives us clarity about where each form sits in space.</p>

<h3>Gesture</h3>

<p>• Gesture is the <strong>flow</strong> or <strong>movement</strong> within the subject.<br />

• It represents <strong>momentum</strong>, fluidity, and life.<br />

• A flowing, curving line can capture how watery and dynamic the body can be.</p>

<h2>The Figure as Architecture</h2>

<p>A living form can be seen as <strong>architecture</strong> when broken into basic solids. For example, a bird can be simplified into balls, boxes, and tubes. These basic shapes can then be arranged in any position we want on our page, two-dimensionally or three-dimensionally.</p>

<p>There’s also the option to <strong>stylize</strong> the figure. Renaissance art, like Michelangelo’s work, used egg-like shapes for heads. Some sculptures flatten and simplify the figure in relief, giving it a more mechanical or geometric feel. The underlying principle is the same: see the figure as architecture before adding any further detail or style.</p>

<h2>The Figure as Fluid</h2>

<p>At the same time, I can layer on the idea of <strong>water</strong> or fluid motion. Imagine the flow and currents of a river. Each contour of the body and each eddy of movement can be fluid. This allows for stylization that can be <strong>playful</strong>, <strong>expressive</strong>, or <strong>dramatic</strong>.</p>

<p>When I combine <strong>structure</strong> and <strong>gesture</strong>, the result can have both <strong>architectural solidity</strong> and a <strong>flowing, lively rhythm</strong>.</p>

<h2>Combining Ideas for Personal Expression</h2>

<p>I like to keep these ideas of structure and gesture with me at all levels:</p>

<ul>

<li>Small details, like a single eyelash, become a simple shape with a bit of life.  </li>

<li>Larger components, like entire limbs, also have a clear structure and a fluid flow.  </li>

<li>Multiple figures can share a grand overall composition that still feels alive and connected.  </li>

</ul>

<p>By stacking powerful ideas, like solid structure and fluid gesture, we open up vast possibilities for <strong>personal style</strong>. We can explore how shape, contour, and flow can be combined for unique expressions in any medium.</p>

<p>Art can be as <strong>simple</strong> and <strong>childlike</strong> or as <strong>complex</strong> and <strong>nuanced</strong> as we choose. If we keep our focus on strong core ideas, everything else tends to fall into place.</p>
