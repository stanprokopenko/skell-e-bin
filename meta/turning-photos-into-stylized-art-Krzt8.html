<p>Hey, how you doing? I'm Ben. I like to draw, paint, and sculpt more stylistic stuff. Today I'm going to walk you through how I use reference, photo reference, and stylize it without sticking too close to the reference itself. We'll be skewing away from all the intricacies of a photo reference, making it our own in a stylized character way.</p>

<h2>2D and 3D Thinking</h2>

<p>First things first, the way I like to think about using reference is by going between one of two minds: <strong>2D thinking</strong> and <strong>3D thinking</strong>. Imagine a spectrum where on one end you have 2D representation (like a square), and on the other end, you have 3D representation (like a cube). In the sketch stage, I slide back and forth between these ways of thinking.</p>

<p>We're going to do this here, and it'll hopefully become more apparent as we move forward. I'll point out when I'm thinking in certain ways, whether it's 2D, 3D, or a combination of both.</p>

<h2>Starting the Sketch</h2>

<p>To begin with, I like to throw down a simple shape that is striking me from the reference. So I'm seeing this kind of triangle shape, we're in <strong>2D land</strong> right now. I want to throw down the neck, get that ear in there, whip that nose in there. We're not going for likeness here, we are just trying to use bits and pieces of the reference to make our character a little more believable. But we're not trying to get the likeness of this model, at least not in this video.</p>

<p>I'm still in <strong>2D land</strong>, trying to put the hair in a rough position to begin with. Now, I'm going to start to tiptoe into <strong>3D thinking</strong>. We can do that in multiple ways, but I like to think about the eye sockets. So now we're thinking about the eyes and how they go into the head, even considering the plane of the head here.</p>

<h2>Building Up the Drawing</h2>

<p>We're going to knock this all back and draw on top of it, and add all the details. Working in this <strong>2D to 3D way</strong> allows me to build a drawing up from nothing. That's the way I like to work, we are building something here.</p>

<p>I'm not just starting from the eye and then working out. That's not an invalid way to work, but I personally like, particularly because we're inventing these shapes, to build them up so I have something to hold onto structurally and build off of. All these features are going to build off one another.</p>

<p>I don't think you should be focusing on line quality at this stage. You can if you want, and by habit, I kind of do, but really I'm just trying to throw down shapes and go back and forth again between that 2D and 3D thinking.</p>

<p>I'm going to try and get those lips in here as simple shapes. You'll notice I'm bouncing around the face, I'm not sticking in one particular area for any super long amount of time. I'm adding that center line here.</p>

<p>Now for the eyes, I'm throwing in the eyelids. I'm not afraid to completely change a whole portion of this at any given time. I'm not tied to any of my decisions here. This is why we're working a little bit looser, because it gives us the freedom to swap and change simple shapes before getting into the details. If we start going into the details too early, it's a lot trickier to make any changes that we want to make.</p>

<p>If you go into the details too early, I tend to find myself getting attached to what I've done. If I spend two hours rendering this hair, I'm a lot less likely to want to move the hair even if it may need it for the final piece.</p>

<p>So here, just going through, getting these real basic shapes down.</p>

<h2>Flipping the Canvas</h2>

<p>What I'm going to do is flip the canvas. You can go to <strong>View &gt; Flip Horizontal</strong>, I have that key bound to <strong>Ctrl+F</strong>. This just gives us another perspective to work from.</p>

<h2>Thinking in 3D Shapes</h2>

<p>Here, you'll notice with the eyes, I'm thinking about the eyes as a <strong>sphere</strong> itself. That's what I want to do, always think about these shapes as <strong>3D objects</strong>. Even this nose, we can simplify this nose down into kind of a triangle or cylinder kind of thing. That's what I'm thinking about here for this nose.</p>

<p>Keeping it simple is really going to help us as we move on to rendering and adding values and color and all that kind of thing. Because we understand these shapes, we can manipulate them however we want, and we can be confident with our decisions when we add light and shadow.</p>

<h2>Refining the Sketch</h2>

<p>I'm going to start to knock back. I'll do this a lot, I'll knock back the shapes and go back and refine them. Again, not getting into the details just yet, just refining these shapes.</p>

<p>Now's a good time to add a new layer, go back to our original sketch layer, and knock this back, reduce the opacity to something along the lines of this. I might even scale this one down just a tad, so we've got a bit of room. Now we're going to refine our thinking a little bit further.</p>

<p>How are these simple shapes that we've put down feeling to us? It does feel a little bit sketchy on this underlayer, and this is where we can take these sketchy lines and be more decisive with our thinking.</p>

<p>Make sure that those lips are going back into <strong>3D space</strong>. Sometimes, because this is almost a profile view, more or less a profile view, you can get stuck into thinking, "Oh, it's a profile view, it's flat," right? It's not, everything has dimension.</p>

<p>So even this nose here, I want to make sure that it looks like it is going back in space. I want to make sure that these lips are dimensional, they're not flat. Again, it's a stylistic thing, it doesn't have to be the way that you work, but I like to have my stuff feel a little bit more dimensional, three-dimensional.</p>

<p>This comes down to <strong>planes</strong> as well. If I don't understand, say, the plane of this cheek, that this is different to that, then I'm going to have a hard time putting light and shadow onto those planes. If I'm a little bit unsure, that's where I get most of the time stuck, being unsure about my shapes come rendering time. So I haven't done my job to clarify things a little bit more to myself, as to where things should go.</p>

<p>I'm adding the ear. So this is a quick little ear shape I like to do, just get the outer shape of that ear in 2D and this lip of the ear, almost like a six that's not connected. That's a nice little quick ear that you'll see in a lot of my work, for better or worse, I like to do it that way.</p>

<p>Now we're just going through and seeing how we can refine some of this stuff. Even having that hint of the eyelash on the other side of the head can really give it a little something, and add again a bit of that dimension.</p>

<p>Adding in the bulk of the hair, this little bun at the back. I just want an indication here of the 3D shape of the bun. So when it comes to refining the shape, I've got a little bit of context to work with.</p>

<h2>Pushing the Shapes</h2>

<p>We're going to do some fun lighting scenarios. I'll take a look at this lip here. Let's see if we can, I want to simplify everything down. So I'm not looking at it one-to-one, but I wouldn't mind getting a similar sort of feel to it.</p>

<p>I'm using a softer eraser just to blast a lot of the detail, and then I'll come back in and refine and refine. You can do that without doing multiple layers. If you don't want to keep your sketches for later, you can just do this all on one layer. But I like to just, I don't think I've ever gone back to a previous sketch layer, it's just a habit really.</p>

<p>Yeah, just refining these shapes. They make sense, but the best part about this is because we understand where the shapes are, we've placed them there for a reason in <strong>3D space</strong>, we've got full control over them. You can tweak them, change them, manipulate them, make this ear a little bit bigger or a completely different shape if we wanted to. We can do whatever we want, there's complete freedom.</p>

<p>I'm not trying to get all nitty-gritty with the details just yet. I still don't classify this as any form of detail work at all, really. I'm still trying to keep the energy of the line, lots and lots of straights, a lot of triangles, a lot of describing lines of the <strong>3D form</strong> as well.</p>

<p>I like to add in some of these little flyaway hairs here as well, just as an indication to remember to do them later on. Because oftentimes, if the hair's looking a little bit plastic, which it can do, adding some of these flyaway hairs does help quite a bit.</p>

<h2>Adding Simple Shadows</h2>

<p>Now, what I like to do as well is just have an <strong>indication of some shadow</strong>. It can help just pop certain things out, like it can help show depth quickly, like with the ear and the neck. Those are two areas that I like to just put in a bit of cast shadow, even if it's not going to be the final lighting setup, the light's going to be that harsh, that's fine. This just gives me a good base to judge.</p>

<p>These shadows, for example, I've seen Teebee Choi do something similar, where she'll do really, really dark shadows in the sections where there's going to be shadow. It just gives it a different feel, makes it feel less flat.</p>

<p>I recommend as well: look at artists that you get really excited about and see if you can try and reverse engineer what they do. <strong>Why do you like the look of it?</strong> See if you can break it down. Is it the line quality? Is it the shading? Is it the colors they use in different areas?</p>

<p>The combination of all those influences is what's going to make up your style at the end of the day, and it has made up my style so far. My style's going to evolve and change over the years as well, it already has done a lot. So don't be afraid to look at other artists and see how they do it. Take stuff from what I'm doing now, that's why we're doing these videos, right?</p>

<h2>Utilizing Digital Tools</h2>

<p>Don't be afraid to use the <strong>lasso tool</strong> either. Utilize the digital tools at your disposal. I used to think that, "Oh no, it's cheating if you're using digital," but that's stupid. Just use them.</p>

<p>If I want to warp this, moving stuff about, this is very, very useful because I can quickly move things. For example, if I want this chin, I think it should be, you can use <strong>Liquify</strong> as well, but I like to just see what I can get done with the warp tool.</p>

<p>Don't be afraid. I've seen other artists do it as well, and that kind of gave me permission to be like, "Oh, if they do it, I can do it as well."</p>

<h2>Preparing for Values and Color</h2>

<p>So I'll finish up some of this line work and get this feeling. Let's do a little flip, how are we feeling? Ah, it's a little off, but we can fix that as we go, famous last words.</p>

<p>A little bit of the furrow of the brow there, just a slight bit of something. Nostril. Carve in those lips a little bit more.</p>

<p>Cool, so we've got a nice little base here. I do want to push the shapes a little bit more, make it a little bit more stylized, but for now, I think we're doing okay.</p>

<p>I might do one more pass with the line work, then we can start to add in some values. More or less redoing the whole thing. So I'll zoom in here now.</p>

<p>When I'm doing these iterations, I'm more or less, I guess in a way, redoing. I mean, I will oftentimes draw whole sections again, yes, but a lot of it is underneath here already, so there's not too much work that needs to be done. It's just a little bit of finessing of the shapes.</p>

<p>I think this does help a lot with the stylization of things because you can almost iterate different, well, different shapes really, that's all you're doing. All this is at the end of the day, is just shapes connected to one another. So if one shape isn't looking quite right, <strong>try a different one</strong>.</p>

<p>Now is a perfect time to maybe keep the eyebrow down, for example, make it look a little bit more cross or a little bit more annoyed than this reference, if that makes sense. We're going to do some fun lighting scenarios.</p>

<p>We've got a nice little base to start adding some values, the basis of the color that we're going to do. We're going to do a <strong>black and white to color method</strong> that I like to do every now and then, and this is going to be fun.</p>
