<p>In this lesson, we focus on the <strong>lightness of touch</strong> in drawing. You'll learn how reducing the pressure on your pencil enhances your lines, making them more delicate and expressive.</p>

<p>We dive into how <strong>light affects drawing</strong>, influencing mood and depth through lines and tones. You'll understand how to break heavy lines into thinner ones to tell a different story.</p>

<p>Maintaining the <strong>flow of the figure</strong> is crucial. You'll explore techniques to keep your drawings lively and dynamic, regardless of the subject.</p>

<p>We introduce simple shapes and mnemonics to simplify complex forms:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Liberty Bell</strong> for the pelvis</li>

<li><strong>Egg</strong> for the ribcage</li>

<li><strong>Tube</strong> for limbs</li>

<li><strong>Mr. T and Mrs. V</strong> for facial features</li>

</ul>

<p>You'll learn to use a light touch when adding tone, enhancing your work without overwhelming it. We also discuss drawing faces and expressions, adding rhythm through line work and minimal tone.</p>

<p>The lesson highlights the value of <strong>life drawing classes</strong>, helping you see reality more clearly and improve your skills. You'll discover the importance of continuous practice and connecting with fellow artists.</p>
