<p>As an artist, you're always seeking ways to improve your artwork. There are countless methods to enhance your illustrations, but it's essential to be aware of common pitfalls. Let's start by focusing on <strong>the don'ts</strong> - things to avoid in your compositions.</p>

<h2>Don'ts</h2>

<h3>Avoid Tangencies</h3>

<p><strong>Tangencies</strong> occur when two separate elements in your illustration touch awkwardly, creating visual tension or flattening the image. Tangencies can confuse the viewer and disrupt the spatial relationships in your composition.</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Example</strong>: If a boat on a lake in the background appears to touch a fence in the foreground from your perspective, it may look like a toy boat sitting on the fence, confusing the sense of depth.</li>

<li><strong>Solution</strong>: <strong>Avoid tangencies</strong> by either pushing an <strong>overlap</strong> between elements or creating <strong>space</strong> between them.</li>

</ul>

<p>When composing an image:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Overlap elements</strong> to establish clear spatial relationships and create depth.</li>

<li><strong>Separate elements</strong> to eliminate awkward touches and maintain clarity.</li>

</ul>

<p>In your workflow:</p>

<ul>

<li>Begin with <strong>thumbnails</strong>, working with large masses and big design elements. At this small scale, it's easier to spot and avoid major tangencies.</li>

<li>As you develop your illustration in a <strong>rough</strong>, be vigilant for new tangencies that can arise with added details.</li>

</ul>

<p><strong>Scaling issues</strong> can introduce tangencies:</p>

<ul>

<li>As you scale up from a thumbnail to a larger drawing, what seemed like sufficient space may no longer be adequate.</li>

<li>Continuously adjust and refine overlaps and spacing to prevent tangencies at each stage.</li>

</ul>

<p><strong>Example</strong>: When drawing a character throwing a punch, avoid depicting the fist just touching the face (a tangency). Instead, show the follow-through where the fist has passed the face and overlaps it, or the moment before impact with space between them. This approach avoids freezing the action and adds dynamism.</p>

<h3>Avoid Corners</h3>

<p>The inherent problem with rectangular compositions is that the <strong>corners</strong> act like arrows pointing out of the image, potentially leading the viewer's eye away from your focal point.</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Advice</strong>: <strong>Avoid placing important elements in the corners</strong> of your illustration.</li>

</ul>

<p>Strategies to avoid corners:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Create dead space</strong> in the corners, allowing these areas to remain empty.</li>

<li>Use graphic elements to <strong>"picture corner"</strong> the illustration, effectively trimming off the corners and preventing the eye from exiting the composition.</li>

<li><strong>Avoid pointing elements</strong> towards the corners, which can enhance the effect of leading the eye out.</li>

</ul>

<p><strong>Examples</strong>:</p>

<ul>

<li>Incorporate foreground elements that <strong>trim the corners</strong>, such as a hand holding a sword coming from outside the frame, pointing back into the illustration.</li>

<li>Use overlapping elements to <strong>redirect the viewer's eye</strong> back into the composition.</li>

</ul>

<p>Focus on keeping elements within the <strong>"live area"</strong> of the image, the central part where you want the viewer's attention. This doesn't mean placing everything dead center, but ensuring that the visual interest stays away from the edges and corners.</p>

<p><strong>Consider graphic elements</strong> like titles:</p>

<ul>

<li>If you're creating a book cover or poster, plan where the title or text elements will be placed.</li>

<li>Design your illustration to accommodate these elements, avoiding tangencies and using overlaps to create depth.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Avoid Sameness</h3>

<p>Repetition of shapes, sizes, or patterns can make your image feel stagnant and boring.</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Problem</strong>: <strong>Sameness</strong>, overly repetitive elements, creates visual monotony. The human brain naturally seeks patterns, but quickly becomes bored by repetition.</li>

</ul>

<p><strong>Examples</strong>:</p>

<ul>

<li>Drawing fence posts that are all identical in size and spacing.</li>

<li>Depicting trees, such as cypress trees, that look the same throughout the image.</li>

<li>Representing anatomical features (e.g., ribs or muscles) in the same way repeatedly.</li>

<li>Having multiple characters of the same size, pose, and placement.</li>

</ul>

<p><strong>Solutions</strong>:</p>

<ul>

<li>Introduce <strong>variety</strong> in size, shape, orientation, and positioning.</li>

<li><strong>Change camera angles</strong> to vary the scale of elements. For instance, bring a character into the foreground by positioning the camera behind them, making them larger and partially cropped.</li>

<li><strong>Overlap elements</strong> to create depth and interest, breaking sameness in positioning.</li>

<li>Vary <strong>spacing</strong> between elements. Avoid equally spacing items, instead, create dynamic compositions by adjusting the distances.</li>

</ul>

<p>Avoid equally spacing elements or making them the same size. Instead, push one element into the foreground and scale others accordingly. This approach adds depth and prevents the image from feeling flat.</p>

<h2>Do's</h2>

<p>Now that we've covered what to avoid, let's focus on <strong>what you should do</strong> to enhance your compositions.</p>

<h3>Create Variety and Randomness</h3>

<p>To prevent sameness, incorporate <strong>randomness</strong> and <strong>diversity</strong> into your illustrations. This adds visual interest and keeps the viewer engaged.</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Use positive and negative shapes</strong> to vary the composition.</li>

<li><strong>Break down your image</strong> into three value ranges: <strong>dark</strong>, <strong>middle</strong>, and <strong>light</strong> values.</li>

</ul>

<p><strong>Techniques</strong>:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Vary the sizes</strong> of elements to create a hierarchy and visual interest.</li>

<li><strong>Offset positions</strong> to avoid symmetry. Place elements slightly to one side, up or down, or tilt them to create an informal balance.</li>

<li>Employ the <strong>"steel yard composition"</strong>, balancing a smaller element further from the fulcrum against a larger one closer to it.</li>

</ul>

<p><strong>Avoid symmetry</strong> by:</p>

<ul>

<li>Placing elements asymmetrically to create dynamic tension.</li>

<li>Balancing high left shapes with low right shapes.</li>

<li>Using negative space creatively to frame and highlight your focal points.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Create Strong Value Separation</h3>

<p>Simplify your image by creating strong <strong>value separations</strong>, which helps in composing and adding depth.</p>

<ul>

<li>

<p><strong>Break down your image into three values</strong>:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Dark value</strong> (foreground elements)</li>

<li><strong>Middle value</strong> (midground elements)</li>

<li><strong>Light value</strong> (background elements)</li>

</ul>

</li>

</ul>

<p><strong>Benefits</strong>:</p>

<ul>

<li>Helps in designing your image efficiently.</li>

<li>Establishes clear silhouettes and shapes.</li>

<li>Enhances the illusion of depth.</li>

</ul>

<p><strong>Example</strong>:</p>

<ul>

<li>In a landscape, you might have dark silhouettes of trees in the foreground, middle-tone hills or grass in the midground, and a light sky in the background. Simplifying the scene into these three values aids in composition.</li>

</ul>

<p>As you refine your illustration:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Maintain the silhouettes</strong> of these value ranges to preserve the graphic impact.</li>

<li>Within each value range, you can add details by introducing three sub-values (dark, middle, light), resulting in a more detailed image without losing the overall value structure.</li>

<li><strong>Avoid introducing too many values</strong>, which can create chaos and flatten the image.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Create Movement</h3>

<p>Introducing <strong>movement</strong> adds dynamism and implies the passage of <strong>time</strong> in a still image.</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Movement</strong> doesn't have to be grand, even small indications can make your illustration more compelling.</li>

</ul>

<p><strong>Ways to create movement</strong>:</p>

<ul>

<li>Show <strong>hair</strong>, <strong>capes</strong>, or <strong>clothing</strong> blowing in the wind, suggesting motion.</li>

<li>Include environmental elements like <strong>smoke</strong>, <strong>mist</strong>, or <strong>leaves</strong> moving across the scene.</li>

<li>Depict <strong>expressions</strong> and <strong>gestures</strong> that imply action or emotion.</li>

</ul>

<p><strong>Benefits</strong>:</p>

<ul>

<li>Movement adds a <strong>fourth dimension</strong> to your artwork: <strong>time</strong>.</li>

<li>It creates <strong>energy</strong> and makes the image more engaging.</li>

<li>Suggests a narrative or ongoing action, drawing the viewer in.</li>

</ul>

<p><strong>Tips</strong>:</p>

<ul>

<li>

<p>When drawing action scenes, emphasize movement:</p>

<ul>

<li>For a running character, show them <strong>off the ground</strong>, capturing the moment of flight in their stride.</li>

<li>Use flowing lines and dynamic poses to convey speed and motion.</li>

</ul>

</li>

<li>

<p>Use environmental cues to subtly indicate motion:</p>

<ul>

<li>Blowing <strong>mist</strong> or <strong>smoke</strong> can define space and add depth.</li>

<li>Align movement of different elements (e.g., hair and smoke blowing in the same direction) to create cohesion.</li>

</ul>

</li>

<li>

<p>Incorporate small details that <strong>guide the viewer's eye</strong> through the image:</p>

<ul>

<li>Use curves, lines, and directional elements to lead the gaze towards the focal point.</li>

<li>Create visual clues that encourage exploration of the composition.</li>

</ul>

</li>

<li>

<p><strong>Expressions</strong> add movement:</p>

<ul>

<li>A raised eyebrow, a determined gaze, or an open mouth can convey action and emotion.</li>

<li>Facial expressions require the face to move, suggesting life and activity.</li>

</ul>

</li>

</ul>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p>By being mindful of these <strong>do's and don'ts</strong>, you can significantly enhance your compositions.</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Avoid tangencies</strong> to prevent flattening your image and confusing spatial relationships.</li>

<li><strong>Steer clear of the corners</strong>, keeping the viewer's eye within the active area of your composition.</li>

<li><strong>Eliminate sameness</strong> by introducing variety in scale, positioning, and elements.</li>

</ul>

<p>Embrace these positive practices:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Create variety</strong> and randomness to add visual interest and prevent monotony.</li>

<li><strong>Establish strong value separations</strong> to simplify and effectively design your image.</li>

<li><strong>Incorporate movement</strong> to add dynamism and the illusion of time, making your artwork more engaging.</li>

</ul>

<p>Remember, while there are infinite ways to create compelling artwork, being aware of common mistakes and effective techniques will help you on your artistic journey. Keep experimenting, keep observing, and continue to find new ways to bring your illustrations to life.</p>
