<p>Hi everyone, I'm here to help you dive into using color in your digital paintings. When we talk about color, there are <strong>three main aspects</strong>: <strong>hue</strong>, <strong>saturation</strong>, and <strong>value</strong>.</p>

<h2>Hue</h2>

<p><strong>Hue</strong> is the <strong>name of the color</strong>, red, green, blue, etc. The <strong>color wheel</strong> displays the different hues in a circular format. You'll find a hue wheel in any digital painting app's color picker, like Photoshop or Procreate.</p>

<p>Some apps might show a vertical hue strip instead of a wheel, which is simply the color wheel unwound. Personally, I find this format friendlier.</p>

<p>In color theory, the <strong>primary colors</strong> are red, blue, and yellow. They can't be created by mixing other colors, but mixing them gives you <strong>secondary colors</strong> like orange, green, and violet. On the color wheel, these secondary colors sit between the primaries.</p>

<h2>Saturation</h2>

<p><strong>Saturation</strong> is the <strong>intensity or vibrancy of a hue</strong>. A color can range from very saturated (vibrant) to desaturated (closer to gray).</p>

<p>When we <strong>desaturate</strong> a color, we bring it <strong>closer to gray</strong>. Gray is important because it connects all hues, acting as a bridge between colors. Desaturated or <strong>neutral colors</strong> often create a more pleasing visual aesthetic.</p>

<p>For example, painting with very saturated colors can feel overwhelming. By desaturating them, the colors harmonize and feel more cohesive.</p>

<h2>Value</h2>

<p><strong>Value</strong> refers to the <strong>lightness or darkness of a color</strong>, independent of hue and saturation. Even in grayscale, we perceive value through tones from white to black.</p>

<p>Value is crucial because it defines the <strong>light and form</strong> in art. That's why even without color, an image can still convey its message. Many artists practice in grayscale before adding color to focus on value.</p>

<p>Value isn't represented on the color wheel. Two colors can have the same hue but different values. Doing <strong>value studies</strong> enhances your understanding of form and improves your color work.</p>
