<p>We've learned a lot about color in this section of the course. Now it's time for you to put that knowledge to practice with some assignments.</p>

<p><strong>Monochromatic Painting Assignment</strong></p>

<p>First, paint a sphere using a <strong>monochromatic palette</strong>. You can use red like I did or experiment with a hue of your own choosing. Try a whole series of monochromatic paintings to see what different feels and emotions different colors bring. This will act as a warm-up for the second part of our assignment.</p>

<p><strong>Repainting with Different Color Palettes</strong></p>

<p>Once you're warmed up, go online and choose some paintings you admire and create some line work from the piece. Then, try repainting them in a <strong>complementary palette</strong>, a <strong>split complementary palette</strong>, and the <strong>four-color palette</strong>. When you do this, make sure to keep the same overall lighting as the original artist, only changing the colors as part of your new palette. Be sure to post your finished studies along with the reference you've used.</p>

<p><strong>Sharing and Critique</strong></p>

<p>These will be the pieces that I'll critique later. Submit your work for critique and ensure to include the reference piece used for comparison.</p>

<p><strong>Additional Learning Resources</strong></p>

<p>We talked a lot about color here in this session. If you enjoyed our discussion, I've got a whole other class on Proko called the <strong>Color Survival Guide</strong>, which dives even deeper into these concepts and applying them to your work. And if you like my teaching style in general, I've got all kinds of other classes on Proko.com covering all sorts of topics. </p>

<p>Good luck with your assignments and I'll see you soon.</p>
