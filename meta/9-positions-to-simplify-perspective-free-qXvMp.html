<h2>What's in Premium?</h2>

<p>In this lesson, you'll master perspective by exploring the <strong>nine basic positions</strong> from which objects can be viewed, including <strong>ortho view</strong> and angles to the left, right, above, and below. You'll learn how to add depth to your drawings using the <strong>Z axis</strong>, transforming flat shapes into three-dimensional forms with thickness. We'll examine how angles change with perspectiveâ€”how right angles become <strong>acute</strong> or <strong>obtuse</strong> depending on your viewpoint. You'll also practice drawing <strong>arrows in perspective</strong> to indicate movement toward or away from the viewer, a vital skill in storyboarding. By working with blocks and arrows, you'll build a strong foundation in perspective drawing, preparing you for more complex subjects.</p>
