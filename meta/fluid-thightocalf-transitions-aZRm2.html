<h2>Observing the Leg’s Front View</h2>

<p>You want to see how the thigh and lower leg connect by focusing on the <strong>knee area</strong>. From this angle, the <strong>inside</strong> of the thigh is often <strong>simpler</strong> and somewhat straight or only slightly curved. The <strong>outside</strong> tends to have a more noticeable <strong>curve or S-curve</strong> that transitions into the knee.</p>

<h2>The “Coke Can” (or Bulging Box) for the Knee</h2>

<p>It helps to picture the knee area as a <strong>small cylinder or “Coke can.”</strong> This shape can also be a <strong>bulging box</strong> that sits between the thigh and the lower leg. You use this shape to keep the forms structured and prevent the leg from looking rubbery.</p>

<h2>Thigh to Knee Transition</h2>

<p>Visualize the thigh tapering down toward the knee. The <strong>important overlaps</strong> happen where muscles bundle around the knee:</p>

<ul>

<li>The inner thigh can be straighter and simpler to measure for proportion.  </li>

<li>The outer side often curves outward more and leads into the knee’s bulge.  </li>

</ul>

<p>When drawing, mark the <strong>slight bumps</strong> you see on both sides. They might not be perfectly parallel but stay somewhat close, which helps you capture the <strong>box-like</strong> sense of the knee’s structure.</p>

<h2>Knee to Lower Leg</h2>

<p>From the knee’s “Coke can,” project the main lines down to the <strong>shin:</strong>  </p>

<ul>

<li>The <strong>shin bone</strong> usually shows a moderate curve or S-curve on the way to the ankle.  </li>

<li>The <strong>calf</strong> sits <strong>behind</strong> the shin. In your drawing, let the front edge of the shin overlap the calf so the calf appears in the <strong>background.</strong>  </li>

<li>As the leg narrows toward the <strong>ankle bone</strong>, keep track of the subtle curves.  </li>

</ul>

<h2>Overlaps and S-Curves</h2>

<p>You create depth by showing clear overlaps:</p>

<ul>

<li>The thigh overlaps the top of the knee.  </li>

<li>The calf overlaps behind the shin.  </li>

</ul>

<p>These overlaps help show the leg’s volume. You also want to decide how smooth or pronounced these <strong>S-curves</strong> should be. Practice <strong>iterating</strong> your choices for how straight or curved each segment is, to learn how it affects the leg’s overall look.</p>

<h2>Bulging Curves and Flow</h2>

<p>Notice how each side of the leg often creates a <strong>series of bulges</strong> that alternate high and low:</p>

<ul>

<li>One side might have a higher bump and then taper as it flows into the next curve.  </li>

<li>The other side might have its bump lower down before it tapers away.  </li>

</ul>

<p>It’s like a <strong>wave fading into the ocean</strong> on one side and an echo of that wave on the other. This <strong>“ping pong” of high-low-high-low</strong> keeps the flow dynamic. You’ll see this rhythm in many parts of the body.</p>

<h2>Practice and Next Steps</h2>

<p>As you continue, <strong>practice</strong> building the knee and lower leg from simple forms. Focus on:</p>

<ol>

<li>Maintaining the <strong>Coke can</strong> shape for the knee to prevent confusion.  </li>

<li>Showing clear overlaps where the calf sits behind the shin.  </li>

<li>Studying the <strong>flow of bulging curves</strong> on both sides of the leg.  </li>

</ol>

<p>With repetition, you’ll get comfortable merging all these shapes and rhythms. Keep it loose at first, then refine the connections so they feel solid but still <strong>fluid</strong>.</p>
