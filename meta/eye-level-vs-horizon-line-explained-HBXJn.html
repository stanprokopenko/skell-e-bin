<h2>Understanding Eye Level and Horizon</h2>

<p>Some students get confused about the <strong>eye level</strong> and <strong>horizon</strong> in drawing. It's true that <strong>eye level</strong> and the <strong>horizon</strong> are the same thing, but it's important to understand <strong>for whom</strong>.</p>

<h2>The Character's Eye Level vs. Your Eye Level</h2>

<p>In a drawing, it doesn't mean that the horizon has to be at the character's eye level. The character is in the picture, and you're not seeing the picture through their eyes. You're seeing the picture through <strong>your eyes</strong>.</p>

<p>Even if you're at eye level with the character, their eye level is on the horizon, and so is yours. But it doesn't have to be. You could be looking up at them or down on them.</p>

<h2>Looking Up at the Subject</h2>

<p>If you're <strong>looking up</strong> at the character, the horizon line (your eye level) is below them. You might indicate this by drawing <strong>under planes</strong> and building them out of structures that you <strong>look up at</strong>. Use cross contours that curve upwards, showing the upward view.</p>

<h2>Looking Down at the Subject</h2>

<p>If the horizon (your eye level) is above the character, you're <strong>looking down</strong> on them. You can indicate that by showing the <strong>top planes</strong>. Their eye level might be seen as a transverse plane, but your eye level is above them, looking down into that plane.</p>

<h2>How Lines Change with Perspective</h2>

<p>When you're <strong>above</strong> the subject, level lines like <strong>X</strong> and <strong>Z</strong> axes go <strong>up</strong> as they go away from you because you're looking down.</p>

<p>When you're <strong>below</strong> the subject, level lines go <strong>down</strong> as they go away because you're looking up.</p>

<h2>The Importance of Your Point of View</h2>

<p>Remember, the characters in the picture have their own eye level and point of view, but the picture represents <strong>your point of view</strong>. This character would see you looking up at them or down on them, depending on your position.</p>

<p>We care about eye level, but it's not for the characters we see in the drawing. <strong>Eye level equals horizon for you</strong>, the viewer of the picture. I hope that helps clarify the concept.</p>
