<p>In this lesson, we're going to do two different things. First, you're going to learn some powerful tools and techniques that will allow you to get light and shadow into your gesture drawings. Second, once you have all the tools and techniques you need to draw dynamic and exciting gestures, we're going to take a look at the gesture drawing process as a whole to make sure that you have a solid understanding of the gesture drawing process and that you leave this course with the knowledge, experience, and confidence to produce dynamic and exciting gesture drawings either from life or from photographic reference.</p>

<h2>Simplifying Light and Shadow</h2>

<p>Before we deal with shading something as complex as the human figure, let's first start with a more simple subject. I often tell students that drawing butternut squashes is a great way to prepare for figure drawing. This is because it shares many of the same shapes and characteristics as the human body and it's the perfect subject to observe as we explore the shading process.</p>

<p>The biggest mistake students make when shading is that they get caught up rendering small details and completely miss the big overall lighting scheme that defines the form. Gesture drawing is not about small details. It's about observing and constructing the figure as a dynamic whole. This holds equally true as we apply light and shadow to our gesture drawings.</p>

<p>To start, we want to think about light and shadow in the most simple way we possibly can. We want to think about our subject as having a lit side and a shadow side. In reality, there are an infinite number of values in between, but we want to focus on the exact moment that the subject turns away from the light and goes into shadow. We want to be able to simplify and draw the moment when light ends and shadow begins.</p>

<p>Here you can see a simplified version of the line of termination or the line that marks when the light ends. This line does an excellent job simplifying the lighting scheme and dividing the subject into a lit side and a shadow side. It's only after you understand this basic division of light and shadow that you can shade with more detail.</p>

<h2>Understanding Shadows</h2>

<p>Underneath the squash, we find the cast shadow. On a simple subject like this, the shadow is cast on the surface that the object is sitting upon. But often, the figure will cast shadows on itself. You should already know that we refer to shadows on the subject itself as form shadows, and shadows created when a subject blocks light from hitting an adjacent surface as cast shadows.</p>

<p>It's important to distinguish between these two kinds of shadows in your drawings. Cast shadows are darker and harder edged, while form shadows, although dark, are slightly lighter than cast shadows and have softer edges.</p>

<h2>Applying Light and Shadow to the Figure</h2>

<p>When you look at a figure, you should see a clear division between the lit side and the shadow side. Sometimes it's easier to simplify values if you squint your eyes or let your eyes go softly out of focus. The first thing we want to do is be able to see and draw the light and shadow patterns as simply as possible.</p>

<p>Although there's not a single correct solution to this problem, the primary line of termination divides the most prominent shapes and forms of the figure into a lit side and a shadow side. For example, the glute on our left is casting a shadow onto the glute on our right. This line of termination doesn't capture all of the shadows, but the shadows we've left out are details that only make sense in the context of a larger lighting scheme.</p>

<h2>Demonstration Drawing</h2>

<p>The demonstration drawing you're about to see was done in under 10 minutes using the exact same tools and techniques that you learned in this course. As you watch this demonstration, note that even though I'm using the same elements, I'm not using them in the same order that you learned them. The tools and techniques are yours to use in whatever way you think is best. Feel free to experiment with them to design your own gesture drawing process.</p>

<h3>Starting with a Primary Action Line</h3>

<p>You'll see me start with a primary action line to simplify the pose into as few lines as possible. I started with the raised arm on our right and down the side of the torso on our right before flipping the line upward and to our left to communicate how high that hip is raised and pushed out. From there, I'll take the line down the outside contour of the leg toward the foot.</p>

<p>Next, I'll draw a secondary action line capturing the direction of the leg on our right, making sure that the foot on our right is lower than the foot on our left. This should all be done within the first minute of your gesture drawing.</p>

<h3>Adding Secondary Action Lines and Axis Lines</h3>

<p>Next, you'll see me draw the axis lines for the shoulders and pelvis. Everything at this point in the drawing is malleable but becomes more solid as I add more information. I'll start to draw the two-chambered shape for the torso, the first closed shape of the drawing. With the torso in place, each new shape I draw needs to be drawn in relationship to it.</p>

<h3>Drawing the Torso and Other Body Parts</h3>

<p>Here you'll see me add the suprasternal notch and follow the sternocleidomastoid on our left up and around the shape of the head. With the suprasternal notch in place, I'll now draw other visible indications of the center line of the torso, for instance, the navel, as well as indications of the linea alba traveling out of the navel both above it and below it.</p>

<h3>Making Proportional Measurements and Adjustments</h3>

<p>Although you won't see much evidence of my measuring in this demonstration drawing, I'm always thinking in terms of measuring. I'm always making visual comparisons between the part of the body I'm drawing and the parts of the body that I've previously drawn. At this point, the figure is starting to solidify. This is roughly where you want your drawing to be within the first three minutes.</p>

<h3>Emphasizing Contours and Overlaps</h3>

<p>As my drawing takes shape, the lines I'm drawing with are getting darker and sharper, but I'm still saving the darkest lines for later on in the drawing. Before I refine the head, I'm going to use my pencil to take a proportional measurement from the reference photo. You'll notice that I'm drawing this new top of the head using a darker line. These kinds of adjustments are common and normal, and you should expect that you'll make many of them while doing your gesture drawings.</p>

<h2>Shading Process</h2>

<p>I'll now begin the shading process by drawing a simplified line of termination, the line that will divide the lit side of the figure from the shadow side. In this first pass, I'm drawing the line of termination with a very light, soft line, and I'm only drawing the most prominent direction changes and curvatures of the line of termination.</p>

<h3>Adding Complexity to the Line of Termination</h3>

<p>Now that I've got a simplified line of termination for most of the parts of the body, I can make a second pass and start to record smaller details. On the second pass, the line I'm using is still soft but darker than the first pass. This second more detailed pass at the line of termination represents the core shadow, the darker band of shadow that runs down the line of termination before the shadow side gets lighter due to reflected light.</p>

<h3>Using the Side of the Pencil for Shading</h3>

<p>Using the side of my pencil, I'll lay a light wash of value on the shadow side of the line of termination. By using the side of my pencil, I'm able to make thick, soft lines that appear to unify the shadow shapes of the figure.</p>

<h3>Refining Lines of Termination and Adding Details</h3>

<p>I'll move around the drawing and refine the lines of termination, adding more and more detail and complexity to the drawing. The amazing thing about a well-crafted line of termination is that it has the power to describe all kinds of anatomical features on the surface of the body even if you don't have a strong sense of the bones and muscles that are creating these shifts in light and shadow.</p>

<h2>Final Touches and Emphasis</h2>

<p>When finishing a drawing, ask yourself what you want to stand out to the viewer. There are three primary ways you can emphasize parts of your drawing:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Darker and more refined contours</strong>: Particularly contours that are drawn quickly and dynamically.</li>

<li><strong>Darkening values</strong>: Particularly at the line of termination.</li>

<li><strong>Adding more detail</strong>: Detail draws people in and often distracts viewers from less finished parts of the drawing.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Grounding the Feet and Blocking in the Hair</h3>

<p>Grounding the feet and blocking in the hair can add a sense of completion to a drawing. If you have time and you'd like to suggest some facial features, a detailed line of termination will often create a compelling illusion of the face. The trick here is not getting overly detailed.</p>

<p>This drawing took just under 10 minutes. It'll take a good amount of time and practice for you to be able to accomplish this much in a 10-minute pose, but hopefully, this demonstration has given you a sense of how the gesture drawing process works as a whole, as well as how much can be accomplished in a short amount of time by drawing efficiently and passionately.</p>

<p>Ultimately, there are no rules to gesture drawing. Every artist does it differently. But in this course, I've tried to introduce you to the elements that most master drawers are using most of the time. Good gesture drawing is at the foundation of all figure drawing. Gesture drawing is the first and most important step you can take toward learning how to do more complex figure drawings. But gesture drawings can also stand on their own as beautiful works of art.</p>

<h2>Practice Assignment</h2>

<p>For today's practice, you'll be drawing from three different practice reels. Each practice reel will contain one 15-minute pose. This is an opportunity to bring together everything you've learned in this course. As you practice today, draw boldly, experiment, have fun, and remember to focus more on your drawing process than the outcome. Good drawing is a byproduct of good process.</p>

<p>I wish you the best of luck with your goals as an artist, and it has sincerely been my pleasure and privilege to have played a role in your process of learning to draw.</p>
