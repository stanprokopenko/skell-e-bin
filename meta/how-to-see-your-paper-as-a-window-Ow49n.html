<h2>What Is the Picture Plane?</h2>

<p>If you don't quite understand the <strong>picture plane</strong>, here's the simplest way to explain it: <strong>It's a window, which is also your paper</strong>. The picture plane is the flat surface on which you create your drawing.</p>

<h2>Visualizing Your Paper as a Window</h2>

<p>If you find it hard to think of your paper as a window, consider this: To capture the complex lines of the world onto something flat like paper, it helps to visualize the paper as a window.</p>

<p>If that still doesn't make sense, try this exercise, <strong>Draw a rectangle on your paper</strong>. Think of this rectangle as a window to a world on the other side. That world may overlap with ours through the <strong>picture plane</strong>, which means we've pulled the viewer back to create a new picture plane, and we can keep doing that.</p>

<h2>The Role of the Picture Plane in Drawing</h2>

<p>The key idea of the picture plane is that <strong>you need a flat plane to make a picture</strong>. Usually.</p>

<p>This concept is important as you work on your next project, where you'll attempt <strong>plan projections using orthos of your chosen objects</strong>.</p>

<h2>Staying Focused on the Big Picture</h2>

<p>As you watch my demos, where I'll show you how to solve most of the problems you'll encounter, remember during all the analytical, precise, step-by-step work not to lose sight of the <strong>big picture</strong> of why we do this.</p>
