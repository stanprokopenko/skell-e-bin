<h2>Understanding the Plan</h2>

<p>Your final project is to create a series of puzzles based on <strong>one plan</strong>. This plan shows <strong>how wide and deep</strong> the object is but tells you nothing about its height. This lack of height information allows you to <strong>invent the heights</strong> any way you want.</p>

<h2>Exploring Heights and Elevations</h2>

<p>You can:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Make positive parts into negative parts</strong> or vice versa.</li>

<li><strong>Squash or stretch the heights</strong> of any portion.</li>

<li><strong>Float one portion above or below another</strong>, connecting them with wires to clarify their positions.</li>

</ul>

<p>Be creative in how you assign heights to different parts of the plan. This exercise is excellent for your brain and isn't too hard if you use a template.</p>

<h2>Using Templates and Height Lines</h2>

<p>Use the provided templates to assist you. When drawing, use a <strong>height line</strong> to track the elevations. Proceed slowly, <strong>every corner counts</strong>, and you need to think about which lines are on the other side. <strong>Fade back the lines</strong> that are on the far side, to enhance the illusion of depth.</p>

<h2>Drawing Orthographic Views</h2>

<p>To ensure you're understanding the spatial relationships, <strong>draw the side and front elevations</strong> (orthographic views). You can do this before or after drawing the oblique views:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>If you draw the orthos first</strong>, conform your oblique view to them.</li>

<li><strong>If you draw the oblique view first</strong>, conform your orthos to it.</li>

</ul>

<p>Drawing the other views stretches your awareness and helps you know the <strong>true proportions</strong> of the object.</p>

<h2>Enhancing Spatial Awareness</h2>

<p>To exercise your spatial reasoning:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Pause and study images</strong> of the puzzles until they make perfect sense.</li>

<li><strong>Try different starting points</strong>: use a side view to play with width or a front view to play with depth.</li>

<li>Remember, a draft view is <strong>one flat view</strong> that needs more information to complete.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Simplifying with Isometric Graph Paper</h2>

<p>You can simplify the task by using <strong>isometric graph paper</strong>:</p>

<ul>

<li>It has angled lines at <strong>60°, 90°, and 120°</strong>, eliminating vanishing points.</li>

<li>You can <strong>count units</strong> to maintain proportions.</li>

<li>Foreshortening is predictable, and you always know how to put a plan into perspective.</li>

</ul>

<p>However, isometric perspective doesn't provide the realism of vanishing points and limits forms to a few fixed positions.</p>

<h2>Moving Forward with Custom Forms</h2>

<p>If you understand the concept:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Create new elevations</strong> based on the provided plan.</li>

<li><strong>Design your own forms</strong> from these plans.</li>

<li>See how many variations you can create while keeping them <strong>right-angled</strong> for now.</li>

</ul>

<p>Some may attempt complex forms with bevels, but it's better to <strong>start simply</strong>. We'll use this thinking in the next lesson.</p>

<p>The three basic views on the three basic axes provide the fundamental truths of how an object occupies space. <strong>Draw from these plans</strong>, or if you're ambitious, <strong>create orthos of anything</strong> you want to learn to draw from imagination. This practice will enhance your spatial understanding and drawing skills.</p>
