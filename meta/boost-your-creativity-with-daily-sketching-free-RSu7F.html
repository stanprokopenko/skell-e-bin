<h2>What's in Premium?</h2>

<p>In the premium lesson, I share my nightly sketchbook ritual, exploring ideas and having fun without any pressure. We'll dive into drawing what you loveâ€”be it <strong>Zelda</strong>, <strong>robots</strong>, or quirky creations like the <strong>Berserker Otter</strong>. I'll explain the importance of <strong>line weight</strong> and how using a three-weight line system can add depth and clarity to your drawings. We'll discuss daily habits for staying healthy and creative, the value of embracing failure to grow as an artist, and ways to combine technology and nature in your work. I also offer practical advice on maintaining a good sketch habit and engaging with the art community.</p>
