<h2>Materials I Use</h2>

<p>I primarily work with oils on <strong>hardboard</strong>. I buy large 4x8-foot sheets from the hardware store, cut them down to my preferred size (usually 16x24 inches), sand them lightly, and apply <strong>three coats of diluted gesso</strong> for smooth, even coverage. After a light sanding, the board is ready to paint on within 24 hours.</p>

<p>My paints are mostly <strong>Winsor &amp; Newton professional grade</strong>. My <strong>palette</strong> includes:</p>

<ul>

<li>Titanium White</li>

<li>Cadmium Lemon</li>

<li>Cadmium Yellow</li>

<li>Yellow Ochre</li>

<li>Cadmium Orange</li>

<li>Burnt Umber</li>

<li>Cadmium Red</li>

<li>Magenta</li>

<li>Transparent Maroon</li>

<li>Dioxazine (Winsor) Violet</li>

<li>Ultramarine Blue</li>

<li>Manganese Blue Hue</li>

<li>Sap Green</li>

<li>Ivory Black</li>

</ul>

<p>While I have all these colors laid out, I don't use all of them in every painting. For this piece, I'm working with a more limited color range.</p>

<p>My <strong>brushes</strong> are a mix, but I'm transitioning to <strong>synthetics</strong> to be kinder to animals. I prefer <strong>filberts and flats</strong> and use smaller <strong>synthetic sable brushes</strong> (nylon) for finer details. The main brands I use are <strong>Rosemary</strong>, <strong>Robert Simmons</strong>, and <strong>Princeton</strong>. I recommend buying a few brushes, trying them out, and finding what works best for you.</p>

<p>For <strong>thinner</strong>, I use <strong>Gamsol</strong>, a synthetic thinner with a low evaporation rate, which means fewer fumes while painting. Always paint in a well-ventilated area. My <strong>medium</strong> is <strong>Galkyd Lite</strong>, mixed with a bit of Gamsol to thin it further. I prefer a thinner medium for the way I paint.</p>

<p>I use shop towels for clean-up and an aluminum <strong>mahl stick</strong> to rest my hand while painting.</p>

<h2>Preparing the Surface</h2>

<p>After completing my tight comp, I print it out scaled to size. If you don't have a large-format printer, you can print on multiple sheets and tape them together. I then use <strong>transfer paper (carbon paper)</strong> to transfer the drawing onto my board. Once transferred, I spray it with a workable <strong>spray fixative</strong> to seal it, so I can paint over it without losing the drawing.</p>

<h2>Starting the Painting</h2>

<p>One of the first things I do is <strong>kill the white of the board</strong>. I don't want the bright white to throw off my value judgments. For this painting, I wash in a <strong>light blue stain</strong>, creating a gradient that's darker at the bottom and lighter at the top. I use a mix of Gamsol and my medium to thin down the paint, working with thin washes at the start.</p>

<p>I encourage starting with thin paint and <strong>building towards thicker applications</strong>. I lay in a general stain using the side of my brush, enjoying that scrubby sound as I cover the board. As I layer, I can still see my drawing underneath, which is essential for maintaining my composition.</p>

<h2>Mixing Colors and Painting Techniques</h2>

<p>When mixing colors, I focus on simplicity. There are really only <strong>three primary colors</strong>: red, yellow, and blue. Mixing these gives you all other colors. For example, mixing yellow and blue gives you green. If you want to gray down a color, you mix it with its complement.</p>

<p>I like to <strong>draw in paint</strong>, focusing on <strong>shape, value, edge, and temperature</strong>. Much of painting becomes intuitive with practice. I don't overthink every stroke, instead, I let my experience guide me.</p>

<p>As I progress, I move to <strong>smaller brushes</strong> for finer details. I'm careful not to overwork areas to avoid turning them into "mashed potatoes". I prefer to lay down a stroke and leave it, maintaining the freshness of the paint.</p>

<h2>Building the Painting</h2>

<p>Consistency is key. I work diligently, often putting in long hours to bring a painting to completion. For a piece like this, it might take me <strong>50 to 60 hours</strong> to finish. I break up my day, working on different aspects or even different projects to keep things fresh.</p>

<p>I focus on adding <strong>facets</strong> and <strong>tiles</strong>, creating form and texture, especially when painting complex surfaces like rocks. I pay attention to the way light interacts with surfaces, adding <strong>cool reflected light</strong> in the shadows to create depth.</p>

<h2>Final Touches</h2>

<p>As the painting nears completion, I let it <strong>set up and dry a bit</strong> before adding final details. Some techniques, like crisp highlights or clean edges, work best when the paint is tacky rather than wet. This might mean stepping away for a meal or coming back the next day to finish.</p>

<p>I always emphasize the importance of <strong>drawing skills</strong>. If you can draw well and understand shape, value, edge, and temperature, transitioning to paint becomes much easier. Painting introduces complexities, but a strong foundation in drawing will carry you through.</p>

<h2>Advice for Aspiring Artists</h2>

<p>The best way to learn how to paint is to <strong>paint</strong>. There's no substitute for hands-on experience. Be consistent, practice regularly, and don't be afraid to make mistakes. Over time, your stamina and skills will build.</p>
