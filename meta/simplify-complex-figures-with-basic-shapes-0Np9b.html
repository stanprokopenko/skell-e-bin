<h2>Tubes for Structure</h2>

<p>I like to use <strong>tubes</strong> as three-dimensional gesture lines. They help me capture both <strong>gesture and structure</strong> in a single shape. If I curve the sides of the tube, I get a figure that feels solid yet fluid. A box shape can also work, but it’s trickier to place the interior corner. Because of that, I often rely on tubes and then weave in boxes when needed.</p>

<h3>Why Tubes Work</h3>

<p>Most body parts can be thought of as <strong>long, linear tubes</strong>, and when we see the bulges for areas like the rib cage or the skull, it’s easy to insert an egg form on top of a tube. This method keeps the figure clear and fluid while still representing real anatomy.</p>

<h2>Incorporating Egg Forms</h2>

<p>Egg shapes are excellent for <strong>bulging forms</strong> like the rib cage, skull, biceps, and triceps. They can bulge out on one side or both, or sit neatly in the middle. Whether it shows up on the silhouette or in the shadow, you can keep it simple or show more bumps for complexity. I often start with a <strong>tube for the overall shape</strong> and then add an <strong>egg</strong> to represent a specific bulge.</p>

<h2>Shadow Shapes and Contours</h2>

<p>When connecting these forms, the <strong>shadow edge</strong> can also act as a kind of contour. I see it as a continuation of the form, not just a separate feature. A bumpy shadow shape reflects more <strong>articulation</strong> between forms. If the shoulder blade and rib cage blend smoothly, it might look less mobile. Introducing <strong>soft bumps</strong> or <strong>cornered edges</strong> shows how one form connects and can move relative to another.</p>

<h2>Practice with Vignettes</h2>

<p>I like to do <strong>vignettes</strong> of smaller areas, such as the foot and then the big toe, or the shoulder blade and rib cage. I iterate those mini-studies, finding a better solution each time. Repetition and small experiments mirror what the great artists in history did, working on figures in pieces to <strong>master complex connections</strong> before putting them all together.</p>

<h2>Simple vs. Complex Bumps</h2>

<p>By adjusting the transitions between tube and egg, I can create:

- <strong>Soft Curve:</strong> Forms blend in the same direction, creating a gentle transition.<br />

- <strong>Slightly Wobbly Line:</strong> Adds nuance without being too bold.<br />

- <strong>Corner or Zigzag:</strong> Emphasizes a strong separation of forms.</p>

<p>A <strong>zigzag</strong> often appears when two egg-like forms stack or sit on top of each other, giving a more <strong>dynamic feel</strong>. Michelangelo’s work is a great example of pushing these bumps to create a powerful sense of movement and structure.</p>

<h2>Balancing Simplicity and Nuance</h2>

<p>Sometimes I’ll keep the contour or shadow shape <strong>super simple</strong> to avoid complexity. If that loses too much character, I’ll add a subtle wobble back in. I play with that balance until I capture a shape that looks accurate yet remains elegantly simple. By iterating and refining, I find the sweet spot where <strong>structure</strong> and <strong>gesture</strong> meet.</p>

<p>That’s the approach I take for building forms with tubes, eggs, and carefully considered shadow shapes. Over time, these studies lead to solid, dynamic figures that feel both realistic and fluid.</p>
