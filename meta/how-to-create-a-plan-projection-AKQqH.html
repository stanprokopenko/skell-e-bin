<h2>Separating the Plan and Projection</h2>

<p>To do a <strong>plan projection</strong>, I start by separating it into two parts: the <strong>plan</strong> and the <strong>projection</strong>.</p>

<h2>Drawing the Plan</h2>

<h3>Creating the Window</h3>

<p>I begin by making what's going to be a <strong>window</strong>. I even give it a little thickness to make sure we understand it's a window. This is like an <strong>orthographic view</strong> of the world, looking down on it.</p>

<h3>Placing the Square</h3>

<p>Next, I place a perfect square. I might eyeball it because I think I can, and if I fail, I can shave it off to perfection. The important parts of this square are the <strong>four corners</strong>, so I make sure we're clear on the positions of those corners.</p>

<h2>Placing the Viewer</h2>

<p>Now, I need to place our <strong>viewer</strong>. We can place the viewer up close or further back. In this instance, I'm going to place the viewer pretty up close, right here.</p>

<p>There's a thing called the <strong>center of vision</strong>. Because one good eye is all we need to see, the center of vision would go right there so that on a 60-degree angle or less from that center of vision, we would be able to see each of these corners.</p>

<h2>Drawing Light Beams from Corners to Viewer</h2>

<p>Now the work begins. I run lines from each corner to the viewer's eye, like <strong>light beams</strong>. We can make them light lines. For the front corner, we need not make a line because that point is already there. The four points that are important are where these lines intersect the picture plane.</p>

<h2>Determining Vanishing Points</h2>

<p>Before we transfer these points down, we need to know where the <strong>vanishing points</strong> for our width line and depth line will be. To do that, we must make a line parallel to either of those lines, coming from the viewer. Wherever that intersects with the picture plane, that will be the vanishing point.</p>

<p>Here's what's important: I take this line and run a parallel line from the viewer. I do the same with the other line. The points where they hit the picture plane are going to be the vanishing points for these parallel lines.</p>

<h2>Dropping the Vanishing Points and Drawing the Horizon Line</h2>

<p>Now we can <strong>drop those vanishing points</strong>. We'll drop them down and place our <strong>horizon line</strong>. Now that we've taken this picture plane and tilted it, I choose to make a horizon line down here. That means that's going to be a vanishing point, and that's going to be another vanishing point.</p>

<p>If we place this in plan right about here, it means that this corner, which I choose for that dot right there, will go up to that vanishing point and will stop right there at this corner.</p>

<p>When we want to go back over to the other vanishing point to get this corner, we'll see that where those two lines intersect gives us the front.</p>

<h2>Completing the Projection</h2>

<p>Now we simply <strong>connect the dots</strong>. That back corner came down to there, ran down. It's going to be on this line somewhere. Exactly where? Let's run from there to the vanishing point, then run that back to the other vanishing point, and connect that to that one.</p>

<p>Now that is a pretty wide-angle square, we are pretty close up in the top view. It's these two views, the <strong>top view</strong> and the <strong>oblique view</strong>, that are important to us.</p>

<h2>Adding Vertical Dimensions (Elevation)</h2>

<p>Now we're done with everything we need here. We can do a couple of things: we can erase stuff, or we can put vellum over this and build our little world on the vellum.</p>

<p>We can say that the <strong>height</strong> of this, the elevation, we will determine from here, where it is touching the glass, unforeshortened. We get that height exactly over here. I want to measure to make sure my dimensions are correct. We are choosing the height as this height.</p>

<p>When we run that over to there and do our vertical lines that high, there's just no doubt about it. All of these lines will connect to give us exactly what we need: this block, which is a somewhat flat block in perspective. We've done the plan, and now we're doing the elevation. The elevation will take us this high in perspective.</p>

<p>So we just make our little dot connections, and everything will connect and work beautifully.</p>

<h2>Exploring Different Heights</h2>

<p>But we're not yet done. We're going to do yet another thing. We're going to say, what if it wasn't this height? What if it were a <strong>stack of boxes</strong>, one box on top of another box, and there was some space in between? This is stuff you couldn't tell from the plan that took the height of this up to, say, there.</p>

<p>Now if I transfer along this line, which is that corner, if I transfer this non-foreshortened line to that level and transfer this one to that level, we've got our vertical corner.</p>

<p>Where do we go from here? Well, we aren't going to keep going up because remember where our vanishing points and our horizon line are, they are down there. So let's do what we would do.</p>

<p>I think we should start up near the top. I think we should say that corner will go down to a vanishing point, and I'll stop right there on that back corner line. This corner will go up because it's below the horizon line, it will go up to a vanishing point and will stop right there on that line. We can now connect those dots.</p>

<p>We'll stop at that corner where, if we run that line back down to the vanishing point, it will stop there. If we want to do a little of that <strong>glass effect</strong> to see what it would look like on the other side, we can do some of that. We can run this corner up to this vanishing point and see where it intersects at that point.</p>

<h2>Final Touches</h2>

<p>We might even do the other one, just to keep that glass effect going. I think we'd better do a vertical line. There we go. We now have this one projected over there, and we can project a little hint of that back corner and run a little hint of that back line.</p>

<p>If we use straight edges for all of this, all of the lines that we're trying to connect in the back will come close enough. That was the projection of the plan with a short height. Of course, if we really wanted to, we could have just said this is all one unit, and then we would have connected that together. But I wanted you to see the <strong>position of the horizon line</strong> was a choice that we made in the projection stage.</p>

<p>In fact, I suppose we could even give these things a little <strong>thickness</strong> like that. If we were to see that up on the plan up here, it might look something like that, maybe a little smaller, and we might have them on the back like so and like so.</p>

<p>For the sake of clarity, maybe <strong>erase the part that goes behind</strong>, or I suppose another way would be to darken it.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p>Now you know how this works. It's a little discipline of understanding, and even if you seldom use it, you can ponder how much the computer does behind the scenes to deliver all those apparently easy 3D models.</p>

<p>There is the theory: this was the <strong>plan</strong>, this was the <strong>elevation</strong>, and this is a <strong>projection</strong>.</p>
