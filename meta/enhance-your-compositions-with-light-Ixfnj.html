<p>Hi everyone, welcome back. Let's talk about composition, specifically how light and color play into it.</p>

<p>I think a lot of times, there are so many different rules placed on composition, like zigzag composition, triangle composition, and all kinds of strange rules. This can get very confusing, and it's all about <strong>rules</strong>. In many ways, this stops artists from understanding what composition is all about, <strong>visual communication</strong>.</p>

<p>What are you trying to say visually with your image? How do you compose the items you see in the frame, and how do light and color on top of those items help you communicate something?</p>

<h2>The Curse of Accidental Success</h2>

<p>There's something that many artists hit, which I consider the <strong>curse of accidental success</strong>. This is when you go to do photography, paint something, or draw something, and 80 to 90% of the time, it doesn't look great. Then sometimes you just hit it, and it looks really amazing. You don't know why, it just does. You think, 'This is great.' As long as I keep brute-forcing my way through by doing hundreds of paintings, sometimes they will look really good.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, a lot of people think when it comes to art that it's some magic thing that happens. That you are just naturally talented. That some people create work magically because they are naturally talented and they're just very lucky.</p>

<p>I would like to challenge this idea. Most artists that make it look easy, it's not about magic. They took the time to learn, <strong>what makes a good image</strong>. They have taken that knowledge and turned it, instead of just natural talent, into an actual skill that makes it look effortless. They applied the knowledge and the skill by focus. So instead of luck, they took the time, persistence, and effort into growing their skills.</p>

<p>We can get out of the loop of accidental success and actually create more images if we understand the principles of what makes a good image, what makes good composition.</p>

<h2>Types of Composition</h2>

<p>There are two different types of composition:</p>

<ol>

<li><strong>Geometric Composition</strong> - The placement of objects within your frame. If there's a mountain, if there's a tree, if there's a person, where are they on the screen?</li>

<li><strong>Lighting Composition</strong>: Adds on top of geometric composition. This includes contrast, what's lit, what's not lit, what colors are there, and how you use the light.</li>

</ol>

<p>Most of this talk will focus around lighting-centric composition, but let me briefly touch on geometric composition.</p>

<h3>Geometric Composition</h3>

<h4>Lensing</h4>

<p>I think it's very important as an artist to understand cameras and how lenses work, the perspective of the viewer or the camera. We spend so much of our days in this modern age watching movies, YouTube videos, playing games, and looking at images online. There's a difference in the way cameras work and see the world than our eyes, and we need to learn how to use those lenses to tell a story.</p>

<p>I went out and had my son help me shoot some images at different focal lengths. We used an extremely wide-angle 8mm lens, all the way up to 600mm. Here's what the lens does to the same subject from the same location:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>8mm Super Fisheye</strong></li>

<li><strong>12mm</strong></li>

<li><strong>16mm</strong></li>

<li><strong>24mm</strong></li>

<li><strong>35mm</strong></li>

<li><strong>50mm</strong>: A classic starter lens, similar to what your eye sees in real life.</li>

<li><strong>70mm</strong></li>

<li><strong>150mm</strong></li>

<li><strong>300mm</strong></li>

<li><strong>600mm</strong></li>

</ul>

<p>We tried an experiment: What if we frame the shot exactly the same, a medium shot where you have mid-belly to the top of my head, but with different lenses? My son had to take the tripod and move himself to have the same composition of me in frame, but the background is very different.</p>

<p>As an illustrator, it's very important to understand why you would choose different lenses and what it does. Particularly as I zoom back, look at the background. With the <strong>600mm lens</strong>, the buoy on the dock is huge, and these little pieces of wood in the water are really big. You can't see any mountains, you just see my face, and everything else is blurry and out of background.</p>

<p>As I reduce the focal length, notice how much more you see, even though my framing is kind of the same on my body. As I zoom back:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>300mm</strong></li>

<li><strong>150mm</strong>: This is a telephoto lens.</li>

<li><strong>70mm</strong></li>

<li><strong>50mm</strong></li>

<li><strong>35mm</strong></li>

<li><strong>24mm</strong></li>

</ul>

<p>Also, notice what it does to the shape of my head. You can see my ears from far away because the camera is far away. As I get closer and use a wider-angle lens, he walked that tripod right up to my face. By the time we're at <strong>24mm</strong>, he's just less than an arm's length away. We get to really wide, and he's just a hand's width apart. It doesn't look like it, but he is really close to me.</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>12mm</strong> - It's getting fisheye. You can't see my ears anymore. My face starts to warp, it looks really funny.</li>

<li><strong>8mm</strong>: I could breathe on the camera. You see the entire world.</li>

</ul>

<p>It's important to study these things, study what they do in films and games. How do they choose their lenses and their view of the world? It gives a very different impression between each of these images, and what the world looks like, what the characters look like.</p>

<h4>Framing</h4>

<p>Another element of geometric composition is <strong>framing</strong>. This is to keep your eye inside the image and to tell you where to look, what is the focal point of the shot, and how to use what we would consider <strong>frames within frames</strong>.</p>

<p>You are looking at a square image when you are watching a screen, and sometimes we have framing elements that we put into the composition to help draw our eyes. For example:</p>

<ul>

<li>This door is a frame within a frame and draws us to the characters.</li>

<li>In <strong>Guardians of the Galaxy</strong>, there's clearly a frame within the frame.</li>

<li>In <strong>The Mandalorian</strong>, the cave helps frame the shot.</li>

</ul>

<p>This type of geometric composition draws our eye to a very particular place. The door provides a frame to have contrast around her face so that I more clearly understand what I'm looking at when I see her face.</p>

<h4>Repetition</h4>

<p>Another tool of geometric composition is <strong>repetition</strong>. We want to take elements in a scene to communicate <strong>depth and scale</strong>. For example:</p>

<ul>

<li>In <strong>The Mummy</strong>, we see people and small boats, and then those boats are repeated and repeated way off into the distance. They're teeny tiny, which tells us just how big the pyramids are.</li>

<li>In <strong>Star Wars</strong>, if we see these domes repeated in scale and characters standing on them, we can understand just how big this building really is by these repeating shapes.</li>

</ul>

<p>It's all about visual communication.</p>

<h4>Leading Lines</h4>

<p><strong>Leading lines</strong> are used where the geometry and texture of the objects in our scene draw our eye to what we're supposed to look at. It's all about the focal point of the shot.</p>

<ul>

<li>In <strong>Stranger Things</strong>, the lines of the wall with the perspective draw us to Eleven, the main character.</li>

<li>All these keys, everything just goes to where we should be looking. They're using leading lines to draw us.</li>

<li>Looking down the stairs, you can see all of these lines of the perspective.</li>

<li>Even in a shot where the characters are not in the center of the frame, the perspective provides leading lines that draw our eye to what is most important. All the chairs and the floor help guide us.</li>

</ul>

<p>Where do you think these characters are going? That path is a leading line that draws us around to the house. This house is important in the story.</p>

<h4>Blocks</h4>

<p>There's another aspect of geometric composition that I call <strong>blocks</strong>. These are big shapes that help us clearly understand what we are looking at. We want to see the silhouette and the shapes of objects.</p>

<ul>

<li>A big block of grass, a big block of house, and a big block of negative space of the sky.</li>

<li><strong>Negative space</strong> is a shape that does not have anything in it but helps us understand the shape of something.</li>

</ul>

<p>In <strong>The Mandalorian</strong>, the ground is really simplified, and the sky is really simplified. So we basically have one place to look, and those big blocks of value and color help us understand the scene interestingly.</p>

<p>In <strong>Blade Runner 2049</strong>, we look at how they are using elements as a frame to draw our eye in these big blocks of large graphic shapes.</p>

<p>In the Netflix movie <strong>Klaus</strong> that I really enjoy, look how with the values and the shapes, there's a big triangle, a big block of blue, and a big block of the dark shapes of the character. All these leading lines are drawing my eye to this character down in the bottom. Everything is pointing to that character.</p>

<p>The composition is very strong because they're using big blocks of value and color to draw our eye to what is most important. The shapes of the cliffs, all kind of leaning in, draw my eye. They also frame the whole image so that if I look off in one direction, these lines say, "Oh, pull me back around," and spiral around to the cart driving in the frame. That is the most important thing to look at.</p>

<p>All of these big blocks of value, shape, and color help me look at what's most important.</p>

<h4>The Rule of Thirds</h4>

<p>There is the <strong>rule of thirds</strong>, something that was invented by the ancient Greeks. They noticed in nature that things split into three was the way nature works. There's something called the <strong>golden ratio</strong>, a spiral that leads to the one-third. The rule of thirds and the golden ratio are very related, but it's more appealing to our eyes to split the image into threes rather than putting the character in the very center of the frame.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<ul>

<li>In this scene, the character is the focal point of the shot and is framed off to the right.</li>

<li>This is also very important for visual storytelling. When you have two characters talking, usually you'll have one on one side, one on the other. The rule of thirds helps when you're cutting between those two characters to say, "I'm looking to the screen left. Now I'm looking to screen right," and I'm looking in the general thirds.</li>

<li>If you study a lot of illustrations, you will see that this rule is followed quite often just to balance the image a little more interestingly.</li>

<li>Another good example is a character from <strong>The Joker</strong>. He's right there in that third zone.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Lighting Composition</h3>

<p>Now let's talk about how lighting affects composition. Lighting is my specialty, I love it so much, and I want to share with you some of the rules of how to make a beautiful image using light.</p>

<p>We go back to these images. What makes these compositions different? Geometrically, they are pretty much the same. It's the same location in Iceland, with the same exploding geyser. But the image on the left, by most people, would be considered a more beautiful, more interesting image because I can understand it easier.</p>

<p>The one on the right gets really muddy. The sky is the same color as the mist of the geyser. It's hard to tell what this is. It's much easier to tell in the first image. These two shots were taken from the exact same angle on different mornings. This one has sunlight coming through it. The <strong>sunlight affects the fog and the mist and provides some separation and depth into the image</strong>.</p>

<p>This lighting is a more appealing composition because it's easier to understand than the other one, where all of the values are the same in the foreground and the background. It's a little hard to tell which trees are in this yard and which trees are in that yard because there's not the fog separating it.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p>By understanding how light and color affect composition, we can create images that communicate more effectively. Instead of relying on accidental success, we can apply these principles intentionally to produce beautiful and compelling artwork.</p>
