<p>When we think of perspective, we usually imagine these complicated grid lines like we're in a 3D computer world. But we don't always need fancy perspective lines to indicate depth. We can use something much simpler called <strong>depth cues</strong>. They're so simple, they're often overlooked. Let's go over six ways to indicate form and depth in our drawings.</p>

<p>Depth cues are simpler alternatives to complex perspective lines. They help you indicate form and depth in your drawings without relying heavily on intricate grids. Here are six methods to achieve this:</p>

<ol>

<li>Overlap</li>

<li>Diminution</li>

<li>Convergence</li>

<li>Foreshortening</li>

<li>Atmospheric Perspective</li>

<li>Rendering</li>

</ol>

<h2>Overlap</h2>

<p><strong>Overlap</strong> is one of the most powerful ways to suggest that something is in front of something else. When you overlap one object over another, it clearly indicates which one is in front. </p>

<p>For example, if you draw two elephants and overlap the left one over the right, it looks like the left elephant is in front. Switch the overlap, and now the right elephant appears in front. Overlap is a simple, foolproof way to suggest depth and it overrides other depth cues to communicate what is in front.</p>

<h2>Diminution</h2>

<p><strong>Diminution</strong> means that things appear smaller as they go back into the distance. You see this every day: people, cars, and objects in the distance look tiny. </p>

<p>If you draw an elephant far away the same size as one close up, it looks like a giant. Things in the distance get smaller, but how much smaller?</p>

<h2>Convergence</h2>

<p><strong>Convergence</strong> explains how objects get smaller and smaller until they reach a vanishing point. This is our third way to create depth. In a box, the parallel edges will converge towards that vanishing point.</p>

<p>Even if there are no obvious parallel edge lines, things will still converge towards the vanishing point. For instance, if you have a person standing close to the camera, you can converge their height towards the vanishing point to determine how tall they would be at any point in the distance. This applies to any point along their body. Essentially, you can fit anything into a box and converge its edges towards a vanishing point.</p>

<h2>Foreshortening</h2>

<p><strong>Foreshortening</strong> occurs when objects go forward towards us and their length appears shorter. With a 3D object, some part of it will always be foreshortened. </p>

<p>For example, on a box, the top is much shorter when viewed from an angle compared to looking straight down. The same applies to the sides. When you rotate the box, different planes become foreshortened. This concept helps you imagine the planes of any 3D object, allowing you to foreshorten the planes going forward.</p>

<h2>Atmospheric Perspective</h2>

<p><strong>Atmospheric Perspective</strong> is the idea that things farther away have more atmosphere in front of them, which hides them. Little particles of water or dust in the air make distant objects look like they're receding into a fog. The farther they go into the fog, the harder it is to see them.</p>

<p>We can apply this to lines as well. Lines that are farther away can be made lighter, blending linear and tonal perspectives.</p>

<h2>Rendering</h2>

<p><strong>Rendering</strong> is a tonal technique used to reveal the three-dimensional form of an object through shading. This involves using the laws of light to shade and bring out the form. This technique will be covered in more detail in future lessons focusing on values and edges.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p>To recap, the four linear perspective techniques are:</p>

<ol>

<li>Overlap</li>

<li>Diminution</li>

<li>Convergence</li>

<li>Foreshortening</li>

</ol>

<p>We also touched on two tonal techniques: Atmospheric Perspective and Rendering. In the next episode, we'll learn how to draw using one-point perspective. See you next time!</p>
