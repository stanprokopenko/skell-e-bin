<h2>The Unexpected Confrontation</h2>

<p>Stan finds himself <strong>tied up</strong> in a mysterious room. A skeletal hand pulls a hood off his head, revealing <strong>Skelly</strong> standing before him.</p>

<p>"Skelly? What the hell!" exclaims Stan.</p>

<p>Skelly rotates ominously in a chair, his chin moving as he speaks. "I notice you've been <strong>cheaping out</strong> on animating me into videos lately," he accuses.</p>

<p>Stan responds, "Yeah, you're kind of expensive. What does <strong>this</strong> have to do with it?" He raises his tied hands.</p>

<h2>Skelly's Heist Proposal</h2>

<p>Skelly reveals his plan to fund his return by orchestrating a <strong>heist of the world's greatest art secrets</strong>. He slides a laptop toward Stan, displaying a wireframe of a building marked with red dots.</p>

<p>"Our goal is the <strong>server room</strong>," Skelly explains. "We take the 405 down to the main facility, enter through the back, and sneak past the guards posted here and here."</p>

<p>He continues detailing the plan, but his explanation becomes increasingly convoluted.</p>

<h2>Stan's Realization</h2>

<p>Underlit by the screen's glow, Stan listens, growing suspicious. He interrupts, "Wait. Is that <strong>my office</strong>? And that's <strong>our server</strong>. What the hell, man?"</p>

<h2>A Trip Down Memory Lane</h2>

<p>Skelly admits, "I just... I <strong>miss you guys</strong>. I want to be in the videos again. Like the <strong>good old days</strong>."</p>

<p>He reminisces about their past antics, recalling moments like Stan <strong>playfully spanking</strong> him. "And my favorite memory..." Skelly grins, recalling a time involving "<strong>Skelly boobs</strong>." He adds, "<strong>Sex appeal sells!</strong>"</p>

<p>Stan responds, "I have <strong>kids now</strong>."</p>

<h2>Reaching an Agreement</h2>

<p>"Can you untie me now?" Stan asks. "I promise you can be in a <strong>Drawing Basics</strong> episode. But <strong>no boobs</strong>!"</p>

<p>Skelly's mouth opens in a smile.</p>
