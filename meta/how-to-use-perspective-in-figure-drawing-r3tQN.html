<h2>Overview of Level Two Exercises</h2>

<p>In level two exercises, artists use gestural perspective references from previous projects to enhance their visual memory. These exercises include:</p>

<ul>

<li>Studying a reference, then drawing from memory</li>

<li>Drawing the pose from a different angle</li>

<li>Changing proportions to practice designing based on memory</li>

</ul>

<p>These exercises aim to <strong>improve visual memory</strong> and <strong>expand the artist's ability to manipulate poses</strong> in their mind.</p>

<h2>Critiques of Student Work</h2>

<h3>Dave Sakamoto's Work</h3>

<p>Dave's work showed <strong>strong basic primitives and mannequin poses</strong>. However, his memory drawings appeared stiff compared to the reference. The pose lacked expressiveness and interesting shapes. The reference showed more dynamic C-curves and pointed toes, while Dave's drawing had more neutral, L-shaped feet. His legs were drawn too similarly, lacking interesting shape design.</p>

<p><strong>Advice for Dave:</strong>

- Look for exciting, expressive elements in poses to remember and incorporate

- Consider how cylinders and boxes come together

- Communicate shapes and gestures more effectively

- Don't fear incorrect proportions; study from dynamic real poses instead

- Exaggerate gestures and look for interesting shapes</p>

<h3>Gannon's Work</h3>

<p>Gannon successfully pushed gesture and captured exciting elements in his drawings. He executed an extreme curve in the spine well and accurately represented the pose from different angles, though he reversed the legs. Gannon also attempted a challenging ant's eye view perspective.</p>

<h3>Blair's Work</h3>

<p>Blair's work showed experience with figure drawing. His gestural drawing was praised as successful, but he lost some of the gesture when changing proportions. In his different angle drawing, there were issues with anatomical connections, and the foot didn't appear properly grounded.</p>

<h3>Andreas' Work</h3>

<p>Andreas attempted challenging angles in his drawings. While some anatomical issues were noted, he was encouraged to continue working on level two exercises.</p>

<h2>Key Elements in Figure Drawing</h2>

<h3>Gesture and Shape Language</h3>

<p>Capturing interesting shape language and anatomy details is crucial for:

- Inventing poses and characters

- Creating more dynamic and expressive drawings</p>

<p>Artists should look for exciting, expressive elements in poses to remember and incorporate into their work.</p>

<h3>Perspective and Balance</h3>

<p>When drawing figures:

- Consider ground plane angles for grounded feet

- Understand balance when inventing poses

- Pay attention to weight distribution and foot placement</p>

<h3>Line Quality and Expression</h3>

<p>To improve line quality:

- Make lines more dynamic, expressive, and interesting

- Balance clean construction with exploration

- Don't let fear of drawing people hinder the quality of work</p>

<h2>General Advice for Improvement</h2>

<ul>

<li>Study proportions from dynamic real poses</li>

<li>Exaggerate gestures and look for interesting shapes</li>

<li>Layer work: start with gesture and proportions before final lines</li>

<li>Practice consistently over time to develop and retain skills</li>

<li>Recognize your mistakes as a valuable skill</li>

<li>Balance gesture and perspective in mannequin drawings</li>

<li>Understand how compression and stretching work in figure poses</li>

</ul>

<p>Remember, it's okay to spend more time on assignments than initially given, as continued practice is important. Drawing from memory is a crucial skill for artists and should be practiced consistently over years.</p>

<h2>Future Course Topics</h2>

<p>The course will move on to cover:

- Shading techniques

- Light effects on form

- Rendering for three-dimensional appearances

- Combining shading with perspective</p>

<p>These topics will further enhance the 3D effect created by perspective and are anticipated to be enjoyable for students.</p>
