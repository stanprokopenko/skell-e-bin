<p>In this article, I'll share some techniques and strategies that have helped me improve my drawing and painting skills. These methods focus on accurate measurement, keen observation, and effective preparation for painting. Let's dive into the details.</p>

<h2>Drawing Techniques</h2>

<p><strong>Accurate Measurement</strong>: I always emphasize the importance of measuring accurately to avoid errors in my drawings. Constant measuring and double-checking are crucial to prevent mistakes from compounding.</p>

<p><strong>Squinting</strong>: Squinting helps me simplify shapes and see them more clearly. This technique is invaluable for capturing the essence of a subject.</p>

<p><strong>Drawing Without a Grid</strong>: While drawing with a grid can feel mechanical, I aim to draw as well without one. This approach adds a more human touch to my work.</p>

<p><strong>Drawing Upside Down</strong>: This technique helps activate the right side of the brain, allowing for more objective observation.</p>

<p><strong>Comparing Freehand to Grid Drawing</strong>: I often compare my freehand drawings to those done with a grid to assess accuracy and improve my skills.</p>

<p><strong>Avoiding Personal Feature Imposition</strong>: I try to avoid imposing my own features onto others when drawing, ensuring that each subject retains its unique characteristics.</p>

<h2>Observation Skills</h2>

<p><strong>Essence Over Anatomy</strong>: Observing the essence of a subject, like a hand, is more important to me than anatomical knowledge. This helps capture the true nature of the subject.</p>

<p><strong>Using Shadows</strong>: Shadows are a powerful tool for seeing shapes better and understanding the form of the subject.</p>

<p><strong>Feature Placement in Shadows</strong>: Even in shadow, knowing where features like the ear are is crucial for accurate placement.</p>

<p><strong>Proportions and Head Tilt</strong>: Proportions, such as ear and eye alignment, change with head tilt. This requires careful observation to maintain accuracy.</p>

<p><strong>Using a Mirror</strong>: A mirror helps me see my work with fresh eyes and catch mistakes that I might have missed otherwise.</p>

<h2>Preparation for Painting</h2>

<p><strong>Spray Fixative</strong>: I use spray fixative to keep charcoal drawings intact before painting. This ensures that my initial work remains stable.</p>

<p><strong>Pre-Mixing Colors</strong>: Planning to pre-mix colors using a limited palette is a strategy I use for efficiency. It allows for faster painting without overthinking.</p>

<h2>Painting Process</h2>

<p><strong>Meaningful Strokes</strong>: I aim to paint with meaningful strokes that tell a story, adding depth and emotion to my work.</p>

<p><strong>Historical Accuracy</strong>: Maintaining historical accuracy is important to me, even in details like how a scarf is worn.</p>

<p><strong>Focusing on Values</strong>: I focus on values over background elements, ensuring that the main subject stands out.</p>

<p><strong>Different Techniques</strong>: I might paint two versions of the same subject using different techniques to explore various artistic approaches.</p>

<p><strong>Ambidexterity</strong>: As a demonstration, I once painted with both hands, showcasing my ambidexterity.</p>

<p><strong>Starting the Painting Process</strong>: After pre-mixing paints, I begin the painting process, building on the foundation laid by my preparation and observation skills.</p>

<p>By incorporating these techniques into my practice, I've been able to enhance my drawing and painting skills significantly. I hope these insights can help you in your artistic journey as well.</p>
