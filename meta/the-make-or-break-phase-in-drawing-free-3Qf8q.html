<h2>What's in Premium?</h2>

<p>In this premium lesson, Eric Gist shares his portrait drawing techniques. You'll learn to start with the <strong>big shapes</strong>, using an <strong>envelope</strong> to establish accurate <strong>height-to-width ratios</strong>. Eric demonstrates how to separate the <strong>hair shape</strong> and <strong>face shape</strong> into general silhouettes, and how to find the <strong>center line</strong> to balance the features.</p>

<p>The lesson covers dividing the face into <strong>perfect thirds</strong>—brow line, nose line, and chin—and introduces <strong>rhythms</strong> inspired by Frank Riley to simplify facial structures. Eric guides you through the crucial <strong>two-value phase</strong>, simplifying the portrait into light and dark shapes to define your drawing effectively.</p>

<p>You'll explore how to refine your work by introducing <strong>additional values</strong>, building up to a <strong>five or six value drawing</strong> without overworking the piece. Eric also shares advice on focusing on <strong>fundamentals</strong>, developing a <strong>broad skill set</strong>, and understanding the sacrifices needed for artistic growth.</p>

<p>Finally, you'll learn how to add <strong>final touches</strong>, emphasizing the <strong>focal point</strong> like the eyes, refining details, and creating a balanced portrait that captures the essence of your subject.</p>
