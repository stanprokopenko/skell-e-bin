<h2>Establish a Daily Drawing Routine</h2>

<p>Challenge yourself to <strong>draw every day</strong>. Try to get into the routine of drawing daily. <strong>Set aside a specific time</strong>, and put it in your calendar. If you're already drawing every day, push yourself a bit further. <strong>Draw a bit longer</strong> or try something new. However, don't go overboard. <strong>Set a manageable goal</strong>, especially since we'll have another project coming up later.</p>

<h2>Daily Drawing Exercise</h2>

<p>Each day, <strong>fill up one page with linear drawings from life</strong>. You can go outside and draw when inspiration hits, or <strong>find something at home</strong> to draw. <strong>Take a photo of your object</strong> if you like.</p>

<h3>Steps for Your Drawing</h3>

<ol>

<li><strong>Observe your subject for one minute</strong> without drawing. Imagine it as a drawing.</li>

<li><strong>Begin drawing</strong> by sketching a few lines.</li>

<li><strong>Look, think, and execute</strong>. Repeat this process until you're done.</li>

</ol>

<p>Each drawing can take <strong>5 to 30 minutes</strong>, but don't worry about timing them.</p>
