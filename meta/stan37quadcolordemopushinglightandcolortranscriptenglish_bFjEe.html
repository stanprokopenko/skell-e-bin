<p>Painting with the many colors on the color wheel can complicate capturing good lighting. Recently, I created a painting where I really pushed a sense of light and color by limiting my palette. Even though the painting looks colorful, I achieved this by carefully selecting and using only a few colors. It starts by deciding the overall temperature of my light source.</p>

<p><strong>I wanted my light source to be warm and inviting</strong>, like an orange hue. For the shadows, I chose the opposite of that color, something like a blue. But I didn't want to use just two colors in the painting, so here's the trick. I split these colors off so I could use two colors in light and two in shadow. As a result, I've got an entire area of the color wheel to work with. This lets me reach the colors I need without feeling overwhelmed by using every color imaginable.</p>

<h2>Preparing the Line Drawing</h2>

<p>Just like last time, I'm going to generate a line drawing using Photoshop's tools. I'll duplicate the layer, go to <strong>Filter &gt; Stylize &gt; Find Edges</strong>. Photoshop gives me a mess I don't need, so I'll press <strong>Control L</strong> to adjust levels. Any digital painting app will have filters like this; <strong>Curves</strong> is another one I commonly use. I don't want all these colors, so I'll press <strong>Control U</strong> to adjust hue and saturation and kill the saturation. Then I'll do a bit of manual cleanup with the brush.</p>

<p>I'm going to get rid of the entire background here. In this one, I'm not focusing on the background; I'll just paint the characters and let the background be a little spotlight color, as if it's on a stage or something. Here, I'm going over the lines, making it into a usable line drawing. This is a good starting point for our line drawing; I've cleaned it up enough. Because we're practicing color and light, I don't want to focus too much on the line drawing. I'll be painting right over this.</p>

<p>To start with, I'll change my line drawing layer to <strong>Multiply</strong>. I'll also be organized and rename the layer. And I'll lock it so I can't paint on it.</p>

<h2>Deciding on a Color Palette</h2>

<p>I have to decide which colors I'm using. Instead of using just one hue for my warm light, I'll <strong>split that off</strong>, giving myself the ability to use this orange here and this green here. The same is true in shadows. Instead of using just that blue, I'll split that off in either direction, allowing myself this purple here and maybe this blue over here. So this turns into something of a <strong>quad palette</strong>—four colors based on complementary colors but split off.</p>

<p>To help keep me organized, I'll lay these four colors on the bottom part of my canvas—my two for shadow, my two for light—so I can always go back and sample them.</p>

<h2>Blocking in the Base Colors</h2>

<h3>Blocking in the Background</h3>

<p>To get started, I'll <strong>flood in the background</strong>. I've decided that I want my light source to be warm, so it makes sense to have my background be cool to help pop the warm light forward. So I'm throwing in a cool light with a textured brush way in the background there. In my original painting, they're in front of a forest, but I'm simplifying that down to just pure color.</p>

<p>I'll pick this blue color and apply a lighter version of it right around the characters. All of this is subject to change later, but I think it's a good block-in to start with. Of course, the water itself is going to be blue, so I'll use a pure saturated version of that blue to lay in this part.</p>

<p>Sometimes it helps to lay in very saturated versions of your colors first. That's not what I did in my previous demos, but I want to show that it's totally okay to go the other way. Instead of starting with neutrals, start more saturated and build your neutrals into it.</p>

<h3>Blocking in the Characters</h3>

<p>Now, the monster is green, so I'll start laying in these <strong>local colors</strong>. Local colors are just the color of the thing that it is. It's a green monster, so I start with green. This is a fairly saturated green to match the fairly saturated blues and purples I've been using. And like I said, I'll build more subtle nuances and neutrals into this.</p>

<p>The flesh tones of the girl character will be in the more <strong>peachy reddish range</strong>. I'll gray that off a little to indicate the color of her dress. Maybe go a bit lighter with its local color. She has dark hair, so let's lay that in, making sure it has a nice amount of contrast against the background.</p>

<p>Looks like I forgot the ear there. There we go.</p>

<p>Going back to my blue, I like to default to blues for cartoony whites of the eyes. It tends to give them a bit more pop. Same thing for the monster character here. Just making sure the eyes aren't white necessarily; there's some blue to them, some color temperature. Remember that eyes reflect their environment.</p>

<p>If I hide my line drawing, even at this early stage, there's something of a painting happening here. My color palette is starting to be put in place, and I can kind of see the effects it might give me. And I've only been working on this for a minute. I'm trying my best to remove all the white of the canvas. In this context, any white will look like pure light. I don't want any of that now; I want to build up to my lights.</p>

<h2>Determining Light and Shadow Areas</h2>

<p>The most important thing to do once I've got my local colors built in is to start determining where <strong>light and shadow</strong> are and what colors are going to be responsible for showing that. I've decided that my light is going to be warm. It might help to put a little division line right here to remind me that these colors belong to two different families: light and shadow.</p>

<p>I'll make a new layer and set it to <strong>Multiply</strong> mode and start working on the shadows. I want my shadows to predominantly be made of these blues and purples. So I'll start with one of them, say the blue. I'll back off the saturation quite a bit. And because it's Multiply mode, I'll pick a slightly lighter color because Multiply is a darkening mode.</p>

<p>Using this, I'll start finding where my shadows are, keeping things very loose at first. Not being too worried about exact shapes or exact drawing. My line drawing will help me get there. I will be turning off my line drawing later, but right now it's still very useful for me to know what this picture is.</p>

<p>It's very important to also switch over to my purples and make sure I'm introducing some of that into the shadows as well. Because this is a split palette made of four colors—two colors responsible for the light and two colors responsible for the shadow—I want to introduce these colors to their appropriate areas early on. Here's a nice shadow that is moving purplish on top of that blue water. This cast shadow will help anchor the monster on top of the water, placing him in perspective.</p>

<h2>Applying Light Areas</h2>

<p>While I'm here, maybe I'll go back to the blues and darken them a little bit so the light of the monster pops out. But speaking of light, let's switch gears and talk about the light side.</p>

<p>Right now, the light is still the remaining colors from my initial block-in, but those were just local colors. In real life, we never really see local color. Every color you see is the result of an object's local color plus the light. And the thing about light is it determines the colors you finally see far more than the local color does.</p>

<p>To block this in quickly, I'll grab a soft brush. I'll pick my <strong>orangey color</strong> because this is going to be closer to the color of the sunlight streaming in. The monster is green, but the sunlight is orange—almost an early sunset type of thing. Changing my blending mode to <strong>Overlay</strong>. I'll pick what I think is a good color for that blending mode and work right on my background layer there. I'll make my color a bit lighter and start blocking in this light.</p>

<p>At this stage, it's a good idea to hide my line drawing and let the light do the talking. Notice that this is even more starting to look like a painting now. With just four colors, I'm starting to get something that looks quite colorful. The nice thing about blending modes like Overlay is I can let Photoshop do a lot of the mixing for me.</p>

<p>A lot of that light will be hitting the girl's face. So I'll put that in there, maybe the tip of her nose a little bit, her dress. The sides of her head, even illuminating the hair on her head like this.</p>

<p>Now I don't want my light to just look orangey, so I can go back to my greens and introduce a little bit of that, making sure that the green monster still looks like a green monster. Remember to put colors into other areas. For example, now that I have green on my brush, I'll put a little bit of that into the water. Carrying my colors through the painting like this will help things feel cohesive and help me arrive at a much more cohesive sense of <strong>color harmony</strong>.</p>

<p>In fact, color harmony only happens when I'm successfully able to carry my colors through a painting, making it look like my colors are involved in many areas rather than being localized and only found in one area.</p>

<h2>Refining Shadows with Ambient Light</h2>

<p>When the monster is in shadow here, I still want the shadows of the monster to pop out from the background. So I'm darkening the background with this <strong>dark purple</strong>, and this will help ensure that even the shadows of the monster, value-wise, will be lighter than the background.</p>

<p>Purple is inherently a dark color, and it's very common even in nature to find very rich dark purples around. I'm going to <strong>flatten</strong> my shadow layer right onto the background layer there. In Photoshop, I just press <strong>Control E</strong> to do that.</p>

<p>Now I'm going to continue to select mixtures that have already happened on my canvas and continue to paint with those for a while. It's time to add a little bit of an <strong>occlusion pass</strong> to the monster. Again, it's those tight little crevices where one object meets another. In this case, where the monster's back meets the water, there's going to be a very limited amount of reflected light or bounce light or diffuse light that can get in there. This causes <strong>ambient occlusion</strong>, which is the darkest part of my shadow.</p>

<p>If you look at the original painting, a lot of the monster's face is bathed in this blue light. That's the opposite of ambient occlusion; it's full-on ambient light coming down from the sky. I've set myself up so I can build those blues into the monster's face.</p>

<p>The shadow value I'm working with now, I consider more of an average shadow. It's kind of dark, kind of not—it's an average. I can build lighter from it. It's a good strategy in painting to always give myself <strong>room to move</strong>. Room to move lighter and darker with values. Room to move warmer and cooler with colors. I can even extend that into things like edges, which we have not talked about in this class yet. Edges being the hardness or softness of my brush strokes.</p>

<h2>Refining the Characters</h2>

<h3>Refining the Monster</h3>

<p>I like to use a kind of medium edge to start with, so I can go harder and softer. This is why I also like to kill the white of the page first, getting me to kind of a middle value, so I can go lighter or darker from there.</p>

<p>If I'm painting characters, it's really important to get their <strong>eyes</strong> in early. It doesn't have to be a finished version of their eyes, but it provides a lot of inspiration to me as the artist when my characters start coming to life right in front of me. I don't want to hold off on that. I want to get them feeling like they're living and breathing as soon as I can, and they will start telling me what they need in terms of painting—what kind of shapes they want or what kind of expressions they want.</p>

<p>So I don't hold off on bringing up my character early on, trying to find where his smile extends up. He's got some teeth there, but I'm going to ignore the teeth for now and just get a nice continuous rhythm to this smile shape, making sure it works without teeth. Then I can add the teeth on top of that.</p>

<p>Just to give you a little preview of what I'm going to do to these shadows, I'm going to sample where I'm at in the shadows right now. It's this kind of middle saturated green. Well, watch this. I'm going to jump up to my blues, which are about here. I could always sample it from my palette, jump up to my blues, but I'm not going to go anywhere near that saturated. I want to bring this closer to the green.</p>

<p>And how do I do that? <strong>By desaturating it</strong>, which on a color wheel looks like this. The shadows were about there, and I want to introduce the influence of blue. But these two colors are too far away from each other on the color wheel. I'll show you what I mean. If I painted this blue onto the character, it's too strong. It doesn't really look like reflected light.</p>

<p>The way to solve this is to pick one of my colors. In this case, I'll pick the blue and bring it closer toward <strong>gray</strong>. I'll start with a blue that's maybe about here. What this does is it brings the blue closer to the green by virtue of bringing it closer to gray. This is because all colors have gray in common. Gray is the meeting point of every color. So if I bring a color closer to gray, I'm also bringing it closer to every other color in my painting. That is a key secret to <strong>color harmony</strong>.</p>

<p>So I'll pick my blue, desaturate it, bringing it closer to gray, raise the value for a bit of ambient light coming down from the sky, illuminating the shadows, and start putting this in. Instantly, it starts looking a little bit more like it could be connected to the environment—light coming down from the cooler environment above. Whenever I can do that with my lighting—have the appearance of my environment affecting the shadows—I instantly gain credibility in my color and light. Because it looks like the environment is a key player in how the characters look, which is exactly how real life works.</p>

<p>As I do this, we are subtly building out our palette, <strong>building that bridge between light and shadow</strong>, or building the path between our two train stops. Although in this case, it's kind of four train stops, right? But it's really not. It's still only two. It's still warm versus cool. The warms being the greens and oranges for the light and the cools being the blue and purples for the shadow. So long as the train goes between those two areas and I'm making sure that those colors show up throughout, this palette will work.</p>

<h3>Refining the Girl</h3>

<p>I haven't really worked much on the child character here, so it's time to get her up to speed. Luckily, she's not too far off. I just have to bring in some basic features. Let's get her eyes in there, the irises to give her an eye line. Let's see if we can find her nose and her hands, which are kind of reaching over the book. I'll just block these in very simply for now, almost like stick limbs or something. There we go. Just to make it look like she's holding the book, resting her face kind of on her hands a little bit.</p>

<p>Let's give her the same treatment as we did with the monster for consistency. That is a bit of a bluish skylight pass on her upper brow because that is the part of her head that would face the skylight. You know, skylight coming down this way would strike the top of her forehead. Let's make sure we're getting a nice pleasing silhouette shape of her hair there, kind of billows out a little bit, making a fun shape.</p>

<p>And I do feel the need to kind of draw her out a little bit, figuring out what exactly are the dimensions of this book she's holding. It's kind of like a box or two boxes that are kind of folded open against each other. There's going to be a subtle bit of occlusion right in here, so I'll indicate that. That'll help set the girl apart from the book that she's holding.</p>

<p>Sometimes you can solve all your problems with shapes in a painting; other times you've got to switch into <strong>line drawing mode</strong> just to figure out what it is exactly you're doing. Her leg is going to come out here, her foot is there, and there we go. It looks like she's plopped on the monster's belly, and the thing that will really sell that is little tufts of fur kind of sprouting up from behind her here. She is sitting on him. There we go.</p>

<p>I'm going to sample one of my shadows I already have for the monster, say this one here, and put that in for her <strong>cast shadow</strong> over the monster. Getting down to a bit of an occlusion shadow right where the book meets the monster's fur, right where the dress meets him as well. And that's about enough for now. I can kind of go back to other areas of the painting.</p>

<h2>Enhancing Color Harmony</h2>

<p>It's important to never let one area of your painting become a straggler that gets too far behind. You want to bring everything up kind of at the same time. I've got a little smudge tool out here that has a lot of texture on it, and I'm just using it to create a bit of a diffuse edge on the monster's fur that I can then work into. I'll do a little bit of the same thing here in shadow as well, just to kind of push and pull these edges around. I'm making them softer now, and then I'll make them harder again as I go.</p>

<p>Using a multiply brush, I'm just going to go over the top of this picture, kind of like a classic vignette filter, just darkening the edges, increasing the sense of a sort of stage-lit thing, just giving this picture a more clear presentation of the focal point. You don't want to make this kind of thing too obvious, so I'll stop there.</p>

<p>Then with an overlay brush set with a very highly saturated blue, I'll start pushing the <strong>color temperature</strong> here to be colder, getting closer to my range of full color temperature from full warm to full cool with grays in the middle. I really want to be careful to maintain areas like this, where there's a lot of little color temperatures at play. That's what's going to make your color look interesting, and I don't want to destroy that.</p>

<p>This whole time I've kind of left the light area of the monster's belly kind of blank. But in reality, that's a very important area of this painting. It's very much part of the focal point. So I'm going to go in there now with a few different color temperatures. I'll use my greens and my oranges. And just try and make this area a little bit more interesting color-wise by adding variety to it.</p>

<p>Remember, I have those four colors to work with, and specifically in this area, it's the two that are in light because this area is directly hit by light. So I want to make sure I get a full gamut of color here. This area right in here is <strong>halftone</strong>. Remember, halftone is where the object is turning away from the light but not enough yet to be in shadow. So I've got to make sure I get a step darker there.</p>

<p>Sometimes it's helpful to lay this in with an airbrush set to overlay mode. Just a step darker. And if I darken the shadows next to it, that's actually okay. And you can see as I do this, the monster's belly instantly starts to turn more, much like our ball did when we painted that demonstration.</p>

<h2>Adjusting Edges and Blending</h2>

<p>I'm getting a bit too dark with that halftone actually, but instead of undoing, I'll just go back to a brush, pick maybe this color here, which I think is more appropriate, and just kind of work into the halftones, lightening up their values. And then while I'm here, I'll start rendering little tufts of fur sprouting out from the monster's belly. This is where you can really sell the effect of a <strong>furry texture</strong> is right at the silhouette. The longer I make the hairs here, the viewer will interpret that as long hairs everywhere. Or if I want the hairs to be more trim, I'll make them shorter.</p>

<p>Try not to repeat shapes. Try to vary your negative shapes—the little areas between tufts of hair—as those will be just as instructive as the positive shapes. The monster's center light area, that is the area that is perpendicular to the light source right in here, I want to make sure that gets the lightest value but still with broken brushwork, because after all, he is made of fur, so it's not going to be a perfectly elliptical shape.</p>

<p>Back to the shadows for a bit. I can also show the effect of hair at the edge of shadow here, making sure that my shadows are not super hard-edged but the shadows themselves have little tufts of hair sprouting out from them. So I'll do a little bit more of that here as well.</p>

<p>Now, if I had red on my palette, I would be using red for the lips, but I don't. So I'm not going to cheat. I'm going to stay with my oranges just to show you that even though you might not have the local color you want—you know, I don't have red for the lips—I can still make this work. Again, at the end of this painting, or if you want to cheat and add some red, this is the time to do it. But I'm going to refrain from that just to make sure I'm staying the course.</p>

<p>I do have purple though, which is the closest color I have to red. So I can start putting some of that in here. Remember that red is a primary color. It's impossible to mix it with other colors, but I can imitate it by being on either side of it—you know, purple and orange. It's not going to be a perfect imitation, but it is a way to work with limitations.</p>

<h2>Adding Final Touches</h2>

<p>Continuing here to work away at the ambient light—you know, that diffuse light coming down from the sky. Sometimes I just call this reflected light as well, even though it's technically not. Reflected light is more of the sunlight bouncing off the ground in this case, but just out of habit. Sometimes I just call any ambient light reflected light.</p>

<p>Reflected light, <strong>bounce light</strong>, ambient light, diffuse light—there are so many terms that kind of mean the same thing. Just doing that same eye socket treatment to the girl character here. Just a little bit of occlusion right up against her upper eyeballs here will make it look like they're inset in sockets. And this whole time she kind of doesn't have a nose. So I think a little bit of reflected light on the top of her nose and maybe even a little direct light hitting her nose like that will help define that part of her head a little bit more.</p>

<p>Want to make sure this hand has just a few fingers here, so I'll block them in at first, just getting some kind of information there. Setting my brush to multiply here to come up with an overall shadow pass on the girl's dress, which is something I probably should have done earlier. I think I should darken this area overall. There'd be a bit of ambient occlusion there, a bit more than I currently have.</p>

<p>Still using my multiply brush here to carve out the monster, making sure that as he turns under here that his form continues to feel like it's turning. Going back to the water, using <strong>horizontal strokes</strong> to feel like it's catching a bit of light here and there. Also, the light is falling onto that water, so let's make sure we lighten it up a little bit.</p>

<p>Now water is an interesting material. Sometimes it doesn't really respond to color temperature as much. So with water, it's okay if I leave this a little bit cold. I can always warm it up by desaturating here, which I'll do a little bit of. I will put a few desaturated strokes. I can also remember to add in other colors. Like this purple I think is warmer than the blue because purple is closer to red.</p>

<p>So remember our very first color chart we did where you could warm up a purple by moving it toward red just on a hue level. Again, that was our first chart. I'm kind of doing that, warming up the water a little bit by mixing in a bit of those purple hues.</p>

<p>And this whole time I forgot that the girl should have a leg sticking out of the other side of the book. So let's go ahead and add that. And getting her little Mary Jane shoes in here as well.</p>

<p>Here I'm just exploring with blues, scumbling in a few of those blue temperatures in there, which are cooler than the greens that are currently there and certainly cooler than the oranges that are also currently there. So I feel like these blues are a nice addition because it helps fill out that range of color temperature.</p>

<p>Hopefully by now you clearly see how it's not about choosing individual colors; rather, it's working with the <strong>paths that the color temperatures are taking</strong>. I've switched now to a smudge tool, which is the first time I've been using it in this whole session. In Photoshop, you might want to turn on the <strong>finger painting</strong> option and be sure to decrease your strength to below 100. This will allow you to paint with the smudge tool. It uses the color on your brush, but then it also falls off and then starts smudging the pixels that are already on the painting.</p>

<p>I really enjoy experimenting with the smudge tool, arriving at tiny little minute color temperature changes and feeling like I'm mixing the colors more like pigment rather than pixels. Make sure that the hairs blend into the monster's body when they meet his overall mass. They should only stand out outside the silhouette. You know, they shouldn't be done like this because this feels more like toothpicks.</p>

<p>Flipping the painting has shown me that I've got to be a bit more clear with my form here, making sure my reflected light from the sky is concentrated to be the lightest value at the top. I darkened the lower part of the monster's head, making it warmer as it turns away from the sky and starts to turn under. The eyes can be a bit lighter since they face the sky more. Conversely, the eyes get darker as they turn away from the ambient light from the sky.</p>

<p>Let's not forget to put a few highlights in; this always helps give characters, especially cartoony ones, a bit of a boost. I try not to make the same decisions with where the highlights go. Remember that a highlight is a reflection of the light source or lighter surrounding environment, so they won't be in the same place over multiple objects.</p>

<p>Just scumbling in slightly warmer hues here because I felt I went overboard with the cools I was using, even though that's what I did in the original. Here I'm playing around with adding a different color to the occlusion; in this case, adding a purple. I felt this area was devoid of purples, and I want to carry the colors of my palette through all areas of the painting whenever I can. These are little refinements I make along the way.</p>

<p>Whenever I do that, I'm building up the bridge between warm and cool, establishing the path the color goes on when it moves from warm to cool and back. I've really increased the saturation of that purple, trying to carry it through the painting, this time in a more saturated state. Just to remind the viewer that this color is part of the palette. Remember that a color takes on its full identity when it's fully saturated. If you can show that color in a saturated state somewhere in your painting, it'll subliminally tip off the viewer to look for those hues in less saturated states.</p>

<p>Zooming in for the very first time in this entire painting to bring up the design and drawing on the girl character. I feel like she's starting to feel neglected, so let's get these shapes working. This task is not one of detail; it's honing in on shapes, making sure all the elements are there and correctly placed. Making sure my values are accounted for, like I'm working on that occlusion value here, which is the deeper part of shadow.</p>

<p>I can go up to her hair and get some reflected light from the environment onto it. She has a hair tie that might get darker as it wraps around this way; that's a little piece of detail that will help. There should be a much stronger sense of light on the side of her head, and because her hair is tied, there will be almost linear vertical sections of clumps of hair moving up toward that hair tie. Remember to use your other colors in the hair as well; so here's a few greens filtering in there.</p>

<p>Almost for no other reason than to carry that color through the palette. I have no realistic reason for using green in her hair; there wouldn't be reflected light there, I don't think. There's certainly no green light from the environment shining on her hair. But it helps carry that color through the palette, so I'll use it sparingly and in very low saturation doses.</p>

<p>A few strands of her hair might catch little highlights. The smudge tool is great for this kind of thing. Using the smudge tool here to get a bit of that ambient occlusion right where the leg meets the monster's fur, where the arm meets the dress, where the head meets the dress. Finally getting some light on the pages of this book. Still using the smudge tool, by the way. I find the smudge tool is a great way to have fun with edges in a painting.</p>

<p>Just a quick tip on the smudge tool: try and find a smudge tool brush that is flat like this because it'll help you get both chiseled edges as well as soft edges by smudging more. Using a desaturated orange here to vary the temperature, in effect adding cools into an otherwise warmer dress, just for a bit of color temperature variety.</p>

<h2>Evaluating When the Painting is Finished</h2>

<p>I just took a short break from this painting, and when I came back, I noticed this kind of line here, kind of a half-moon shape. That shape is okay but it's too hard-edged; it's starting to not feel like fur. It needs to have more of a taper, so I'm going to fix that first. By adding in a bit more of a sense of varied edges and furry textures here. To help the monster's belly maybe more gradually fall into shadow.</p>

<p>Going to make generous use of the smudge tool here to help me with this. Here I'm working back in that center light area, which again will be the lightest part of the monster's belly because it's perpendicular to the light but being very textured with it. Now just putting in a few of these lesser saturated or cooler greens. I don't want to do too much of this because it's kind of the incorrect temperature for this area, but a little bit of temperature play will be interesting, I think.</p>

<p>So again using the smudge tool to help me create very soft edges. And I've kind of hinted at this tip, but I'll just outright say it here: if you are trying to blend between colors and make it look seamless in your painting, <strong>use soft edges</strong>. If I were to paint that same color like this with a hard edge, it suddenly looks a bit out of place. Even if I made soft brush strokes, it starts looking a bit too hard. So that's why I'm doing this color shift here using soft edges made by my smudge tool.</p>

<p>But before too long, I'll switch back to a slightly warmer green, adding that saturation back and then painting with that. Now I'm finally starting to feel like I'm building enough color into the monster's belly for it to be as interesting as it needs to be because it's so prominent in the painting.</p>

<p>I'm going to get a soft airbrush, set it to <strong>linear dodge</strong> mode, and using my warm orange color, I'll indicate some <strong>God rays</strong> streaming in here, motivating this light source. I want this to feel like it's lit by either a magical sunlight or maybe a stage spotlight, something that is super specific as to where it's shining. On a narrative level, that might help create a nostalgic value that I want this illustration to elicit as well.</p>

<p>I'm doing the same thing with the blue hue now, but being very careful. If I overdo this, it'll look way too strong, but a little bit will make it look like that reflected light is just a bit stronger. And because I'm using a very soft airbrush with a very soft touch, all my playful brushwork beneath that will be preserved.</p>

<p>I've got an odd decision here where the book is intersecting her leg; her leg should be in front of the book. Let's fix that little logistical issue. Making sure the light on her leg wraps around here. Her arm is casting a shadow onto the pages of the book. We can get a bit of occlusion even right where her arm is colliding with the book. We don't want to make it look like she has a mustache; let's use a very soft edge here.</p>

<p>I always find myself talking less at the end of these demonstrations because now it's just a matter of getting all the small logistics in place. For example, making sure her sleeve wraps around her arm, making sure her leg is properly lit, maybe warming up the stockings she's wearing a little bit. You can see the sock maybe a little bit through the shoe there; paint that in. Now that shoe is colliding with the monster, so there should be some occlusion there.</p>

<p>Let's get a soft brush; I'll sample the same color that the shoe is, maybe warm it up actually, and put that tiny bit of occlusion right in there. Really helps position that shoe in space and the girl as a result.</p>

<p>To indicate little lines of text on the book, I'll get a multiply brush and abstract it like this, just to make it clear to the viewer that this is a book that's open. So there's text there to read, but it's not important that the viewer be able to read that.</p>

<p>One of the big questions you'll probably always face in your work is <strong>knowing when you're finished</strong>. In my case, it's a couple of things. First, on a shape level, when I'm tweaking smaller and smaller shapes, I know I'm getting close to being done. And on a color level, I feel like I'm finished when the painting is fully populated with all the different colors in my palette. Either in saturated versions or desaturated versions, once I feel that color dispersion is enough to satisfy different areas of the picture, then I know that area is done. Adding a little color here or there probably won't make too much of a difference. I'm nearing that stage now.</p>

<p>Another thing I recommend is if you think you're done but not quite sure, just save it for the night and come back to it in the morning. Chances are you'll see something you didn't notice before or you'll look at it and say, yep, I'm done. I don't feel the need to add anything more. Remember that you always could add more things, but that doesn't necessarily mean you have to add more things for it to feel finished. Your viewer is probably not going to stress out about one brushstroke over another, whereas as a painter, you can really get sucked into that loop.</p>

<p>But here I'm adding a little highlight on the arm just to make sure it pops out and reads; that's kind of an important thing to add. Kind of a neighboring one on this hand. I think my highlight on the tooth there is a bit overstated, so I'll soften it down, darken its value, soften its edge. This tooth is a bit unstructured, so I'll refine its shape. Maybe plunge it a little bit into occlusion as it goes into the mouth up here. See how that put the tooth inside the mouth? Those are the kind of little logistical things that I look for near the end of a painting, just to make sure I'm accountable for every little thing. So the audience gets what's going on and doesn't get thrown off by something that should be obvious.</p>

<p>Another great way to determine if you're done is to show it to someone in your family, even better if they're not an artist themselves. I show my wife my work all the time. She's not an artist, but she's very good at knowing when a picture feels finished. Because I trust her opinion, she's always very open with me about what throws her off or if anything might need some tweaks. If she stumbles over something visually, not quite sure what's going on, she'll tell me and then I have to interpret how to fix that.</p>

<p>So there's a few strategies you can use in your work to help you decide when you've finished your paintings. Sometimes just a good old <strong>deadline</strong> is the best thing to have; you're done when your time is up.</p>

<p>The other thing I like to do in my paintings is zoom in like this and start having just a bit of extra fun with color temperatures. In this case, spotting a saturated blue around there. Just increasing the presence of saturated little color notes here and there. Of course, it's very easy to overdo this, so you notice I'm working in very little spots rather than large swaths. And this is not rendering form or anything like that; it's pure abstract fun with color.</p>

<p>Here I'm using a dark background color to carve out the shape of the girl's face. I found she was getting just a bit lost back there. This reminds me of exactly what I did earlier in the painting, carving out the monster in shadow with the same dark background. Just continuing that up here. I'm making sure my brush strokes taper off in a soft and maybe graceful manner out into the abstract background.</p>

<p>Maybe the side of her eyeball is catching a bit of the warm light, so I'll scumble that in. Again, these are all the small details that tell me I'm nearing the end. Of course, there'd be light hitting her ear there. That ear is pretty far off her head, so I'm just going to take a selection here, nudge it in, fill in the gaps by sampling the colors that are surrounding it. Fill that in; that's better.</p>

<p>I just want to separate the top plane of her hand from her face, so I'm using a color that's almost too cool for her skin, but it does help me get a bit lighter with it. Remember, as you add saturation, you decrease value, so I want to lighten my value, which means I have to get a bit cooler unfortunately. But that's okay because I think in this area it's small enough that this will help separate the hand from her face.</p>

<p>Alright, one big area I've been missing is the <strong>reflection</strong>. We can get this in pretty easily. I'll pick a round brush, set it to overlay mode. I'll sample some color of the monster, maybe a bit darker than that. Even darker yet, I'll shrink the size of my brush. I'll just, with one continuous brushstroke, scribble in a reflection shape. Little negative spaces that I happen to be leaving behind are okay because that will look like reflections from the sky caused by ripples in the water.</p>

<p>Switching my color now to a bit of a warmer color just to offset this. Then I'll get back to normal mode, pick one of the colors already in my water, and start painting over my reflection pass. Again, adding little incidental reflections of the sky caused by ripples in the water. While I'm here, I can maybe lighten up some of the water that's around the monster. Because water is constantly moving, there's always little subtle color undulations, little temperature shifts.</p>

<p>So here I can warm this up by getting a gray or purple, which kind of looks like almost orange in this case because it's up against such a saturated blue. The reflection is another good place to make sure you get in all the colors of your palette, just to make sure it feels like it's part of the rest of the painting. That's what will make it feel complete rather than drawing a perfectly detailed reflection. After all, if it is a reflection, it's going to be reflecting its surroundings. So we want to make sure that those colors are present in the reflection as well.</p>

<p>And as a final, final touch, just like I did in the other painting with the monster on the bridge, adding that little bit of <strong>glow</strong>, which is already kind of present there, but just heightening it a little bit to add that extra sense of magical light to this thing. And just like that, we can call this finished.</p>

<p>Would you guess that this painting only uses four colors? By carefully selecting and managing my palette, I've achieved a colorful and harmonious painting. Limiting the palette doesn't limit creativity; in fact, it can enhance it by forcing thoughtful decisions and deliberate techniques. I encourage you to experiment with a limited palette and see how it can push your sense of light and color.</p>
