<h2>What's in Premium?</h2>

<p>In the premium lesson, James Gurney takes you through three of his sketchbooks, spanning from 1985 to recent works. He shares insights from his self-taught journey, studying masters like Dean Cornwell, Caravaggio, and Vel√°zquez. You'll see his early sketches that led to "Dinotopia" and learn how he combines media like gouache, casein, and pen in his work. James discusses techniques for capturing motion, handling complex subjects, and emphasizing imagination in sketching. He also answers questions about his process, warming up, and using 3D maquettes for reference.</p>
