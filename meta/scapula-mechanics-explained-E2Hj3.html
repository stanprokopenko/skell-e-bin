<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>I want to explore the <strong>scapula</strong> from behind, and examine how it connects with the <strong>rotator cuff</strong> muscles. The scapula is a large, plate-like bone on the back of the rib cage. It features elegant twists and bevels that exist for key attachments, like <strong>tendons</strong> and <strong>ligaments</strong>, and it plays a vital role in the shoulder’s wide range of motion.</p>

<p>When drawing the scapula from behind, I focus on:

• The <strong>spine of the scapula</strong>, which sweeps across the bone.<br />

• The <strong>shoulder joint</strong>, where the head of the <strong>humerus</strong> fits into the <strong>glenoid cavity</strong>.  </p>

<p>I usually start by sketching the scapula’s general shape. Then, I map in the attachments of the <strong>teres minor</strong>, <strong>teres major</strong>, <strong>infraspinatus</strong>, and the head of the <strong>tricep</strong> that sits between those muscles.</p>

<h2>Rotator Cuff Muscles</h2>

<p>From the back, the rotator cuff region can appear complicated. Several muscles overlap and attach around the scapula in specific ways:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Infraspinatus</strong>: Occupies most of the scapula’s surface on the back.  </li>

<li><strong>Teres Minor</strong> - A narrow muscle below the infraspinatus. In some individuals, it is separate, in others, it may blend with the infraspinatus.</li>

<li><strong>Teres Major</strong>: Larger than the teres minor, it sits below and forms a V-like shape with the teres minor.  </li>

<li><strong>Tricep</strong> (long head): Slips between teres major and teres minor, attaching onto the scapula.  </li>

</ul>

<p>These muscles handle the arm’s rotation at the shoulder joint. By understanding how they layer and attach onto the scapula, I can draw them more convincingly when the arm twists or extends behind the body.</p>

<h3>Drawing Note</h3>

<p>I often use <strong>cast shadows</strong> or slightly darker lines to show which muscles overlap. A harder, sharper line or shadow usually pops forward in the drawing, while softer lines or lighter edges recede. This helps clarify how these muscles fit together in 3D space.</p>

<h2>Turning the Scapula</h2>

<p>When the arm moves backward or rotates, the scapula shifts position. In some angles, the humerus is foreshortened, so I might show a cross-section of the humerus as if it is coming toward me. It can help to imagine the humerus as a simple <strong>cylinder</strong> with a wider “ball” at the top.</p>

<p>In these foreshortened views:

- The <strong>deltoid</strong> might be peeled away in the drawing to reveal the shapes underneath.<br />

- The <strong>infraspinatus</strong> and <strong>teres minor</strong> can change how much of them is visible. Sometimes you only see a thin slice of the teres minor behind the humerus.<br />

- The <strong>tricep</strong> emerges where it slips between the teres muscles.  </p>

<p>I also keep track of which structure is in front. If I draw through the scapula to show the deep muscles, I remind myself this is a “see-through” or “transparent” diagram. Under normal circumstances, the outer muscles (like the deltoid) would obscure everything underneath.</p>

<h2>The Pectoralis (Chest) Connection</h2>

<p>Though we often focus on the scapula from the back, the <strong>pectoralis</strong> on the front also helps drive shoulder motion. It has multiple heads that fan from the clavicle and sternum toward the humerus. When you move the arm backward, that changes how the pectoralis stretches and attaches. I often picture the pec as a broad band that:

- Originates along the <strong>clavicle</strong> and <strong>sternum</strong>.<br />

- Narrows into its <strong>tendon</strong> near the humerus.<br />

- Wraps around so that it can help pull the arm forward or across the torso.  </p>

<p>Because our shoulders are designed for extensive range of motion, these chest and back muscles overlap and interact a lot. Drawing them well means understanding the layers, where each head attaches, and which edges we actually see in a given pose.</p>

<h2>Practical Tips for Drawing</h2>

<ol>

<li>Start with <strong>basic shapes</strong>. A cylinder for the humerus and a flattened triangular shape for the scapula give a framework.  </li>

<li>Use <strong>overlapping lines</strong> and <strong>cast shadows</strong> to show which muscle is frontmost.  </li>

<li>Keep asking, “Where does this muscle attach? What does it tuck under?” That prevents drawing any muscle as if it is transparent or floating.  </li>

<li>Don’t get stuck on perfect rendering. A strong structure is more important than adding painstaking detail.  </li>

</ol>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p>The scapula is a <strong>beautifully complex</strong> bone that anchors many important shoulder muscles. By seeing where the <strong>teres minor</strong>, <strong>teres major</strong>, <strong>infraspinatus</strong>, and <strong>tricep</strong> attach, we gain a clearer picture of how to draw the back of the shoulder. From a side or angled view, I stay aware of the humerus’s foreshortening and the overlapping of these powerful rotator cuff muscles. In the front, the <strong>pectoralis</strong> also feeds into the humerus, contributing to the shoulder’s impressive mobility.</p>

<p>When I combine knowledge of these forms with <strong>clean, overlapping lines</strong> and some simple shading, I can convey the shoulder girdle’s forms convincingly. This approach helps me create dynamic figures, whether I’m sketching from life or imagining characters in motion.</p>
