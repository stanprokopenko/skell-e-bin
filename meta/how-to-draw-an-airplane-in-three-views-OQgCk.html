<p>Your project is to draw an object in at least three <strong>orthographic views</strong>. I'll demonstrate this using an airplane. How do you start?</p>

<h2>Choosing the Best View to Start</h2>

<p>A <strong>front view</strong> isn't great to start with because it is so foreshortened. A <strong>side view</strong> might not be suitable either because you can't see the wings, they are on the width line, and in side views, width goes into the paper. Let's try a <strong>top view</strong>.</p>

<h2>Drawing the Top View</h2>

<p>Ah, the top view is ideal. You can see the whole body and the full wings, and it's flat enough that you can practically trace it. Cheating? Well, at least put down the important width, length, and basic measurements.</p>

<p>Place the airplane model and use a <strong>T-square</strong> to draw a perfectly horizontal line, giving you the major axis of the airplane. Ensure your drawing is <strong>symmetrical</strong> along the centerline. If that's the center, you want the distance from it to be exactly the same on both sides.</p>

<p>Measure and mark the following:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Wings</strong>: Where they start at the back and where they go at the front.</li>

<li><strong>Width</strong>: How far out the wings extend on both sides.</li>

<li><strong>Nose and Tail</strong>: The points where the nose starts and where the tail ends.</li>

</ul>

<p>Connect the points to outline the wings and the body. Note that the body tapers in towards the nose. Measure how much it tapers and connect those dots. Think of the airplane as <strong>boxy</strong> as possible to simplify the drawing.</p>

<p>Darken the lines that are important. These will be essential when you transfer them to other views.</p>

<h2>Understanding Line Systems</h2>

<p>In the <strong>top view</strong>, you can only see the <strong>depth</strong> and <strong>width</strong> lines. It can't show the <strong>height</strong> lines because those would just be points. When you move to the <strong>side view</strong>, you'll lose the <strong>width</strong> line system because width goes into the paper, making it just a dot. You won't be able to see how wide the wings are. Instead, you'll focus on the <strong>depth</strong> and <strong>height</strong>.</p>

<h2>Transferring Measurements to the Side View</h2>

<p>Transfer the measurements from the top view to the side view below it. This allows you to run down those lines and know that the top view (the <strong>plan</strong>) will inform your side view.</p>

<p>Run down important lines from the top view to the side view:</p>

<ul>

<li>How far back certain parts go.</li>

<li>How far forward the tip of the nose is.</li>

<li>The positions of the wings and other components.</li>

</ul>

<p>Use the transferred measurements to draw the side view, focusing on the <strong>depth</strong> and <strong>height</strong>.</p>

<h2>Drawing the Side View</h2>

<p>Start by drawing the side profile, based on the transferred measurements. Remember, from the side view, you can't tell the width of the wings, you only see their depth and height.</p>

<p>Measure the <strong>height</strong> of the airplane body and ensure it matches the proportions from the top view. Consider that the height might be equal to the width, making the body a perfect square in cross-section.</p>

<p>Add details like the tapering of the body towards the nose and the wings' position and angle. Include the <strong>zenith</strong>, the highest point of the airplane, which is the top of the dome.</p>

<p>Darken the lines to commit to them, showing that you're sure those lines are correct.</p>

<h2>Transferring Measurements to the Front View</h2>

<p>From the top and side views, you can deduce the <strong>front view</strong>. Transfer the necessary measurements:</p>

<ul>

<li>The <strong>height</strong> of the nose, tail, and body.</li>

<li>The <strong>width</strong> of the body and wings.</li>

</ul>

<p>In the front view, you can see the <strong>width</strong> and <strong>height</strong>, but not the <strong>depth</strong>.</p>

<h2>Drawing the Front View</h2>

<p>Draw the front view using the transferred measurements. Ensure symmetry by verifying that distances from the centerline are equal on both sides.</p>

<p>Include details like:</p>

<ul>

<li>The <strong>dome</strong> at the top of the airplane.</li>

<li>The <strong>wings</strong>, showing their width from this perspective.</li>

<li>The <strong>tail</strong>, ensuring it's centered and properly aligned.</li>

</ul>

<p>Note that in the front view, certain parts like the wings might be foreshortened and appear as lines or edges.</p>

<h2>Reviewing the Orthographic Views</h2>

<p>Let's review:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Top View (Plan)</strong>: Shows <strong>depth</strong> and <strong>width</strong>.</li>

<li><strong>Side View</strong>: Shows <strong>depth</strong> and <strong>height</strong>.</li>

<li><strong>Front View</strong>: Shows <strong>width</strong> and <strong>height</strong>.</li>

</ul>

<p>By understanding these views, you can now draw the airplane in three-quarter views from any position. When you know how to draw in perspective, you won't even need to look at the model.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p>I hope you learned from this. You can now do your own. Find an object that is complex enough to have multiple planes. A <strong>Kleenex box</strong> is okay to start with. If you get it right and have someone else look at it and they can't find any mistakes, that means you understand the concept. Then you can take it to more complex and <strong>dazzling</strong> things.</p>

<p>Well, see you next time.</p>
