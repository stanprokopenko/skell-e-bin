<p>Hi, I'm Linnea, also known as FIFAO on the internet. I'm an artist and illustrator, I draw for a living. This is my sketchbook, my loving sketchbook.</p>

<p>I like to say that all good sketchbooks are supposed to be chaotic, just filled to the brim with all kinds of stickers. So, as soon as I open my sketchbook and I see these stickers, I feel inspired to create. This one's made by my friend, and I like my cats, some Moomin, some Kaiba, all things I love and enjoy.</p>

<h2>My Sketchbook and Materials</h2>

<p>First off, it's a <strong>Moleskine</strong> sketchbook. We love their paper. They're quite expensive, but since I don't use my sketchbook every day, I'm not much of a sketcher, it was worth splurging on a bit of a fancier sketchbook.</p>

<h2>Exploring the Pages</h2>

<h3>Breaking Into the First Page</h3>

<p>Starting off with a quick portrait. I think I drew this on an airplane, so my hand was a little bit shaky. The first page of a sketchbook is always the most difficult one to break into because you put this pressure on yourself that it has to look cool. So I was happy to get that one over with.</p>

<h3>Character Portrayals and Styles</h3>

<p>More character portrayals. I love a good flowing line. I love thick lines as well, like thick line weights. You'll see this all along the sketchbook, that it's mostly women, girls doing girl things.</p>

<p>This is a piece that I colored digitally. I made the outlines, then took a photo of the illustration to color it in Procreate. It's so easy, you just take a photo of your sketch, and then you don't have to deal with the mess of watercolors.</p>

<h3>Themes and Motifs</h3>

<p>I love snakes. I love cute girls. I love bones. Another self-indulgent one. I really love the teet necklace that I made on this one. I draw the outfits that I wish I could wear or wish that existed in real life or that I'm too lazy or too shy to actually wear.</p>

<p>I love the thick arms on this one. I love a girthy forearm. I think this is around the time where I started experimenting more with exaggerating the anatomy.</p>

<h3>Inspiration from Kaiba</h3>

<p>If you've seen the anime <strong>Kaiba</strong>, it has always been a huge style inspiration for me. They really add thickness to their limbs, creating a very goopy feeling to it. It's such an underrated gem, a lot of marshmallow bodies. I rarely see fan art of Kaiba, so watch Kaiba and make fan art of it. It needs a reboot in popularity.</p>

<h3>Venturing Beyond Humans</h3>

<p>Oh, this is the first time I'm drawing something that isn't just a girl. We have a centaur going on. Occasionally, I like to challenge myself by drawing something non-human. It's one of those rare cases.</p>

<h3>Character Design vs. Storytelling</h3>

<p>People often ask me, "Linnea, you draw so many characters, would you use them for a comic?" For me, making character designs or character drawings has never been about putting them in an actual story because I'm useless at actual storytelling, like writing and stuff. I just want to make cute people wearing cute outfits, and then it's so surface level. It really doesn't go any beyond that.</p>

<h3>Soft Shapes and Marshmallow Bodies</h3>

<p>Some bodies, soft shapes, marshmallow bodies. Cute fashion girlies - quintessential FIFAO.</p>

<h3>Mushrooms and Zines</h3>

<p>Our first mushroom drawing. I think this one I made for my <strong>Funglery</strong> zine. It's kind of like a thank you at the final page.</p>

<h2>My Sketching Routine</h2>

<h3>Overcoming Art Block</h3>

<p>What's my routine for using my sketchbook? These days I do want to make more good sketches because I think at the beginning of the sketchbook I was just so into drawing digitally that I completely neglected actual physical drawing. When I'm so art-blocked, I just gotta do something, right? So I do something super quick and easy.</p>

<h3>No Thoughts, Just Shapes</h3>

<p>I always start off with kind of just no thoughts, just throwing in a shape on the paper and then kind of... It's like a conversation, right? I usually don't have a fully visualized idea of what I want to make. I kind of just make it up as I go. And if I see one shape working particularly well, I can add on to that and more. That's kind of how I work with all of my illustrations.</p>

<h3>Sketchiness and Emotional States</h3>

<p>Sometimes I write notes that I'm like, "These are so important. Dear future Linnea, you must remember this important message." But then like one week later, I'm like, "What's going on?" I think also I was being quite art-blocked at this point. You can see the hesitation in my lines, just going over and over again.</p>

<p>I think it's interesting to see that if I'm in a mood where I'm very into a feeling, it's easier to draw. I tend to super intuitively land the lines on the first moments. But then if I'm more stressed out, if I'm kind of forcing myself to draw, I'm just going over the same movement over and over again.</p>

<p>I do think they turned out quite nice. I don't dislike the sketchiness. I don't dislike the roughness. It almost feels weird when I see them afterwards because I can almost tell the emotional turmoil I was going through just looking at these.</p>

<h2>Experimenting with Gold Pen</h2>

<p>Copic came by and gave me a free gold pen, and it just happened to be like the best gold pen I've ever tried. You'll see here, I really like that gold pen, you guys. So, of course, I had to utilize it for everything.</p>

<p>This one's just like a quick falling star. A full-on animal, quite proud of myself. A lot of good hatching, a lot of good sketchy feel to it. Especially when you do more dark stuff like this, adding an element of gold and keeping some of the whites in, really brings out the contrast in the piece.</p>

<h3>Drawing Unicorns</h3>

<p>Some unicorns. Usually, I never draw unicorns because one thing about me is that I'm really scared of horses. Unicorns I like, though!</p>

<h2>Developing My Sketches</h2>

<p>This is kind of around the time where I started sketching more seriously. I feel like this first half I'm almost embarrassed to show it. Usually, this is what people don't see, but I wanted to be completely candid and show what's going on behind the scenes, behind the pretty illustrations.</p>

<p>Whereas the latter ones here, I'm like, I actually gave a smidge bit more of an effort.</p>

<h3>Winged Creatures</h3>

<p>I really like this one. I think I had no plan of what I was making when I first started sketching on this. I was just in the mood to draw multiple wings. I think I drew the wings first, and then the lion body came in afterwards.</p>

<h3>Conceptual Drawings</h3>

<p>A girl with a selfie, I can't lose my branding, you know. This is a bit more of a conceptual one, maybe. I was thinking about how we are controlled by our hearts, so I wanted to do it in the literal sense. It's not something I would post, because usually when I make illustrations, I like them to be kind of a snapshot into a story. You can look and be like, "Okay, I get the lore, I get what's going on." Whereas this one's a bit too avant-garde for my usual stuff. But that's what sketchbooks are for, they're for quick explorations.</p>

<h3>Drawing Rats</h3>

<p>Moving on. We have rats! One thing about me is I love rats. I had multiple rats growing up, and this is my little ode to them. I wish I was better at drawing rodents. I feel like I should be drawing more rats. Whenever people tell me they're getting like a bunny or a hamster, I'm like, "Why would you get the worst type of rodent? Rats are where it's at." They are so intelligent.</p>

<p>When I was in middle school, I used to sneak my pet rat into my shirt sleeve because she was so tame, right? So cuddly. I'd just sneak her in, and she would just stay there and snuggle with me while I was drawing during classes, you know, misbehaving.</p>

<h3>Exploring New Ideas</h3>

<p>I've been meaning to color this one, two people gazing into each other's eyes, and the exchange of atoms or cells kind of melding into one, exchanging facial goop.</p>

<p>This is a banger, guys, a gutted bunny. I don't have a vendetta against bunnies, I don't want them dead. They are like the ultimate prey animal, I think. Like, you see a bunny or a lamb, and you think, "That's a victim." This one's going to the slaughterhouse. Sort of very symbolic in that way.</p>

<h3>Fan Art Moments</h3>

<p>Usually, I don't do fan art. But <strong>Twilight</strong>, you know, the movie that everyone hates or the book series that I happen to be obsessed with, it just got announced that it was getting an animated series. So I was like, "Okay, Linnea, you never make fan art, but you gotta draw your girl Alice for a moment, you know, give her her flowers."</p>

<h2>Putting in Effort</h2>

<p>Now this was nice, you know, I tried with this one, guys. This was like a multiple-hours drawing. I had just bought a bunch of new graphite pens, you know, the soft ones. Because usually I'm just like, "Ah, whatever, I'll just get the cheapest mechanical pencil and go at it." But now I got actual fancy pens, so I'm like, "Oh, you know what?"] I'm going to do the proper shading, going to add some nice darkness to it. Then get some soft blending in there as well, you know, smudge with my fingertips, all those cool art techniques.</p>

<p>This one is a mechanical pen for sure. Pop of color, can't go wrong.</p>

<h3>Drawing Tigers</h3>

<p>Some tigers. These were really fun to draw, actually. I used a reference for these. I get bored quite easily when I follow a reference too closely, so I still wanted to add a nice flowy pattern to the fur, kind of like ink dripping into water and swirling. It just adds an elegance to them.</p>

<h3>Creative Ideas</h3>

<p>This one's stupid, it looked really cool in my brain. I think when I first made it, I'm like, "Oh, this is going to be such a cute little idea." Basically, her brain is exposed, and it spells "you" because you are on her mind, you know, brain, mind. Anyway, it's done. Moving on.</p>

<h3>Combining Elements</h3>

<p>Here we have girls, bugs, some intestines for hair deco, and an intestine halo. We got teeth, bacterial action going on, and a bug. You may not like it, but this is the ideal woman right here.</p>

<p>It started off as just me painting my cats, but then I got bored, so I wanted to add some alien elements into it and just kind of give a good swirling effect. I think this is the first time I took out my watercolors for like a year, so honestly, I was surprised by how much I liked it. This one's kind of inspiring me to go back into watercolor.</p>

<h3>Fan Art and Inspirations</h3>

<p>And right here we have <strong>Serial Experiments Lain</strong> fan art, you know, one of my favorites. Very weird, very disturbing, kind of avant-garde. It's actually supposed to be viewed like this, with her normal self here, and this is like her digital computer version of herself in the wire.</p>

<p>I love the idea of being able to switch out your heads.</p>

<h3>Creative Critique</h3>

<p>The one thing that bothers me about this one that I don't know if anyone else would think about is just that their head sizes, all the different animals are the same, whereas in reality they'd be vastly different, right? It's just one of those things where you're like, "Hmm..." Some things, I mean, it obviously wasn't supposed to be a realistic drawing, but still, I feel like there's...</p>

<h3>Accepting Simplicity</h3>

<p>Sometimes it's okay not to challenge yourself. Which translates to sometimes it's fine to not challenge yourself. Because when you're art-blocked, you kind of feel like everything you touch turns into utter garbage, so that's why I like to just really go back to the simplest essence of what I know by heart to make, and then kind of get my mojo, slowly build my mojo back up from there. This is a nice reminder of that.</p>

<h3>Exploring Dark Themes</h3>

<p>And here we have bunnies, slightly gory, I guess, not too gory. This one, though, I wanted it to be a regular body, but then kind of these two blocks separating and everything except for the guts and her bones being what's left. If I developed it a bit more, it might turn into a cool idea, but as it is now, it's kind of... you know, it's a work in progress.</p>

<p>This one's very much inspired by <strong>Natalie Hall</strong> - legendary sketch artist, also tattoo artist, makes the best kind of creatures. This one is a bird, but with five legs. It started off with just me drawing a dead bird, as per usual. I kind of got bored by the realism, so I started adding more and more legs until it became these beasts. But now it doesn't feel dead anymore, it feels more like a creature of vengeance, you know, something you'd be scared of.</p>

<h3>Closing the Sketchbook</h3>

<p>I think this is the final page, actually, so we've come full circle. I actually drew this while I was at <strong>Lightbox</strong>, you know, because I have a table here. And so during slow hours, I just mindlessly doodle some girls. You know, one great thing about being an artist is that you're never truly bored. You can just pick up a pencil and sketch away. This is a perfect example of me doing just that, you know, no thoughts, no brains, just kind of like doing.</p>

<p>And then, of course, the ending, which is more stickers, of course. You saw that I only had stickers on the front? No, of course I gotta deck out the back as well, you know? So we have some Dance Dance Revolution. This one's a classic. Moomin.</p>

<h2>Questions and Reflections</h2>

<h3>Using Gradients</h3>

<p>In your sketchbook, I saw a lot of gradients from white to black with your characters.</p>

<p>Yeah.</p>

<p><strong>Have you tried doing the opposite where you have a black background and your characters are the light part of it?</strong></p>

<p>I have done that, for sure. I think usually it's more when I do digitally because then it's less, you know, painting involved. I can just color-drop a black background. I actually think it's easier on the eyes to kind of go from dark and brighter, and it gets a more gloomy kind of feel to it.</p>

<h3>Darker Themes</h3>

<p><strong>Do you have a lot of darker themes? Do you think you gravitate towards those darker themes?</strong></p>

<p>I like to kind of balance a lot of dark and gory art in my work because I'm extremely fascinated by death and the process of decay and just kind of the ending of life, the life cycles and stuff. But I don't want it to be too dark, too much of a shock value, so I do always kind of throw in an ethereal, cutesy vibe to everything that I make. Because at the end of the day, I don't make death-related or dark stuff because I'm necessarily attracted to the negative aspects of it.</p>

<h3>Favorite and Least Favorite Parts of Drawing</h3>

<p><strong>What's your favorite and least favorite part of drawing, like at least in your sketchbook?</strong></p>

<p>Oh, I hate having to start drawing. Oh, it's the worst. I think especially if I haven't drawn for a while, and I build up this dread over having to face a blank canvas, right? Once I do get a good process going, I get my mojo in, I get sucked into the process, I start enjoying it.</p>

<p>Until I start laying out the base colors, I start hating it again. When you put on the first layer of coloring, it always tends to look bad, until you render it out and fix out the kinks. But then eventually you get to the final stage of a painting, and that's when you kind of start to enjoy the process again because then you can add the fun details, the highlights, and the cool whips of hair blowing in the wind. So it's kind of like a start from the bottom, it goes up, it goes down again, and then it goes up.</p>

<h3>Thoughts on Sketchbooks</h3>

<p>So don't feel bad if your sketchbook isn't super refined. I feel like they're more of a visual diary for artists, and you don't have to show them if you don't want to. I used to be extremely self-conscious about my sketchbook processes. I used to be so ashamed that I didn't want anyone to see my mistakes or my explorations.</p>

<p>Well, I think that's a beautiful part, that you shouldn't... you know, it's fine to keep your sketchbook private, but it also is fun to just kind of let go of that shame and let others into your thought process.</p>

<p>Thank you so much.</p>

<p>That's lovely.</p>
