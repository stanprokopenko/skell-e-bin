<h2>What's in Premium?</h2>

<p>In the premium lesson, we dive into mastering straight lines in drawing. You'll learn the importance of practicing longer lines to improve control. We cover techniques like pulling versus pushing lines, ghosting the line before drawing, and experimenting with different angles. The lesson also explores using your non-dominant hand, adjusting tools and materials to vary difficulty, and trying different drawing speeds. You'll be encouraged to challenge yourself and find the methods that work best for you.</p>
