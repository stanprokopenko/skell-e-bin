<h2>What's in Premium?</h2>

<p>Discover how to draw an anvil from eye level using perspective techniques. In this lesson, you'll learn to establish the horizon line and vanishing points to create a guiding grid. We'll construct a box as a framework for the anvil, ensuring accurate proportions and depth. You'll use orthographic projection and the X method to find key points and centers. We'll guide you through drawing the anvil's base, body, and horn, paying attention to how lines change direction in perspective. By the end, you'll understand how to use grids and projections to render complex forms accurately in 3D space.</p>
