<p><strong>Welcome back! I'm here to critique your shaded spheres and guide you through the most common mistakes in value organization and shading. We’ll look at spheres drawn with both unlimited and timed challenges (25, 10, and 5 minutes). Instead of repeating the same critique for each drawing, I’ve grouped the issues so you can spot them in your own work and improve faster.</strong></p>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p><strong>Here are the most frequent errors and how to address them:</strong></p>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p><strong>1. Incorrect Terminator Placement</strong></p>

<p>A major mistake is putting the terminator, the line dividing light from shadow, too far into the light side or in the wrong spot.</p>

<ul>

<li><em>When the light source is far away</em>: The light rays are almost parallel. The terminator should cut right through the equator of the sphere. Think of it like slicing the sphere through the middle.</li>

<li>If you put the ellipse too high, too low, or make it too small, you’ll get odd slices that don’t wrap correctly around the form, making the lighting feel off.</li>

<li><em>If the light source is very close</em>: (like a lamp just a foot away from a small object) the terminator shifts away from the middle of the sphere. That’s technically possible, but it implies a specific lighting setup. In our class reference, the light was far away, so the equator placement is correct.</li>

</ul>

<p><strong>Visualizing the Placement</strong>

- Imagine a ball with parallel light rays: the shadow division sits right across the middle.

- Core shadow sits just inside the terminator, never on the light side.

- The ellipse should mark the correct equator, not just skim a cap off the side.</p>

<p><strong>Relating to Other Forms</strong>

- The same logic works for eggs and Loomis heads (those classic drawing methods for constructing human heads with spheres and planes).

- Once you can chop, slice, and shade a sphere or a box, you’re ready to build and shade almost any form.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p><strong>2. Reflected Light and Value Separation</strong></p>

<p>Another mistake is making the reflected light area as light or lighter than the halftones.</p>

<ul>

<li>If reflected light blends with your halftones, the form loses its 3D illusion. It can even start looking metallic, which only works if you also adjust the rest of the shading to match metal.</li>

<li>Your core shadow should stay firmly on the shadow side, away from the terminator. </li>

<li>Keep a clear separation between light and shadow families: cast shadow, occlusion, core shadow, reflected light, halftones, highlights.</li>

<li>Don’t compress your values into two or three steps on the light side. Give yourself enough values to show halftones clearly.</li>

</ul>

<p><strong>Tip</strong> Review value zone templates. Check where each value, such as core shadow, cast shadow, or reflected light, sits, and refer back to demo videos or handouts.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p><strong>3. Gradation and the Cosine Law</strong></p>

<p>Many of you have a gradation from core shadow to light that is too linear (smooth over too big an area) or too quick (hard edge, jumps suddenly).</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Lambert’s Cosine Law</strong>: The biggest change in value happens closest to the terminator (core shadow). After that, the transition into the lighter halftones happens much faster. </li>

<li>If gradation stretches across half the sphere equally, the form looks flat.</li>

<li>If the light area jumps suddenly from dark to light, it’s like a cube’s corner, a sharp edge, not a sphere.</li>

<li><em>Good gradation:</em> Most transition packed near the shadow, light halftones cover most of the light area.</li>

</ul>

<p>Running out of time on quick studies often leads to halftones being left out or not blended properly. That’s normal, just aim to get the key zones first.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p><strong>4. Cast Shadow Shape</strong></p>

<p>The cast shadow under your sphere should always be an ellipse when it’s on a flat surface.</p>

<ul>

<li>Common errors: cast shadow as a teardrop, pill shape, candy corn, or with straight edges and curved ends.</li>

<li>The ellipse’s shape should match the logic of the form and the direction of the light.</li>

<li>On <strong>flat surfaces</strong>, deviations from ellipse shapes are a mistake.</li>

<li>Only break this rule if the sphere casts onto a <em>curved</em> surface, like a leg or a banana. Then, wrap the shadow accordingly, but that’s not our exercise here.</li>

</ul>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p><strong>5. Halftone Patches and Value Organization</strong></p>

<p>Many spheres show patches of halftone with values out of sequence, dark areas near highlights or uneven jumps.</p>

<ul>

<li>These create the look of dirty, smudged, or stepped surfaces, not clean smooth transitions.</li>

<li>Some messiness is fine, if the average values are in the right place, the sphere will look solid.</li>

<li>Don’t allow dark swatches to replace smooth gradations. Avoid placing dark halftones right beside the center light or isolating light patches within shadows.</li>

<li>The largest, cleanest zones should be in place even if texture or “noise” is present.</li>

</ul>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p><strong>Understanding Form and Shading Fundamentals</strong></p>

<p>Shading spheres is about <em>studying the science of light</em> and how it interacts with form.</p>

<ul>

<li>Master spheres, cylinders, and boxes, since they’re the starting point for constructing any form.</li>

<li>After you nail the basics, start applying the same rules to organic shapes, muscles, wrinkles, and fat under skin. These add complexity, but still follow light logic.</li>

<li>Structure first: organize your forms and shadows to look 3D and convincing, then add complexity and softness for realism.</li>

</ul>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p><strong>Drawing Approach and Materials</strong></p>

<ul>

<li>Using white charcoal on toned paper or drawing “backwards” can make some transitions trickier.</li>

<li>In quick pen and ink drawings, noise from the medium hides small errors, but you still need to follow value organization.</li>

<li>Time constraints will affect how finished your transitions and halftones look. That’s expected, prioritize the big value zones first.</li>

</ul>

<p><strong>Final Thoughts and Encouragement</strong></p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Focus on these five major mistakes:</strong> Identify where you missed and deliberately practice correcting them.</li>

<li>Understanding the “why” behind shading, <em>the science of light</em>, makes building the illusion of form much easier.</li>

<li>As you get comfortable, you’ll spend less time fretting over specific values and more on making creative design decisions and telling stories with your art.</li>

<li>You all did a great job. Spot your mistakes, fix them, and keep practicing, these are the building blocks for everything you’ll draw next.</li>

</ul>

<p><strong>Let’s keep shading, keep practicing, and have fun getting better. See you next lesson!</strong></p>
