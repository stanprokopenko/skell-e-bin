<h2>Initial Color Mixing and Adjustments</h2>

<p>I started by laying in the <strong>average light</strong> but quickly realized it was too yellow. To adjust, I added more gray to the mix, incorporating black, a touch of red, and green to achieve a grayer tone while maintaining some yellow. I noticed I had used too much ocher to lighten the color instead of white. Testing the new mix, I added more white, which introduced a coolness, bringing the color closer to the photo reference. I rubbed off some of the previous mix to avoid dealing with the jaundiced tone.</p>

<h2>Application of Average Light</h2>

<p>I considered adding more white to make the average light lighter, which would make the halftone appear darker. Mistakes are part of the process, and the key is to recognize, fix, and adjust them. I applied the average light, avoiding obvious dark halftone areas, to better judge values. Ignoring the highlight initially allows for better control later. The paint is set thinly, allowing for darker values to be added without buildup.</p>

<h2>Simplifying Values and Learning from Masters</h2>

<p>I encouraged those painting along to trust their graph drawing, and simplify values. <strong>Squinting</strong> helps determine if areas blend into shadows, or remain part of the light. I referenced studying Sargent's work in black and white, appreciating the beauty of simplified values. We're mimicking the effect of Sargent's work, focusing on lights and darks. Some areas may seem darker than they are, it's important to learn to paint in a posterized way.</p>

<h2>Techniques for Specific Areas</h2>

<p>For the lips, I used a slightly redder halftone to reflect their natural color. I used a larger brush to create planes within the hair using black and white. Avoiding distractions in the painting helps maintain focus on the overall composition. I used black and yellow ocher to create a greenish tone for the shirt, given the limited palette.</p>

<h2>Maintaining Focus and Perspective</h2>

<p>Keeping it simple and stepping back helps maintain perspective. I thinned the paint for larger areas to cover ground efficiently. For the scarf, I used alizarin crimson and white, adjusting with yellow to avoid pink tones. Covering the head in one average value allows for more detailed work later. The limited palette challenges us to achieve variations with minimal colors.</p>

<h2>Basic Lay-In and Further Refinement</h2>

<p>The basic lay-in includes shadow and average light, setting the stage for further refinement. The approach taught in school was to cover the head in one average value and work into it. Staying within the average value family helps maintain a cohesive look. The painting will become more beautiful with limitations, avoiding a busy appearance. I prepared clean spots for further work and planned to address halftones next.</p>

<h2>Assessing Progress and Simplifying Process</h2>

<p>Using a mirror helps assess the painting's progress and potential adjustments. <strong>Edges alone can tell a story</strong>, and I'll demonstrate this in a sidebar later. Combining shapes, values, and edges simplifies the painting process. Color is the final element, and variations will add realism to the flesh tones. Vibrating color is a technique learned over years, adding detail and realism.</p>

<h2>Next Steps in Painting Process</h2>

<p>The next stage involves working on halftones, building on the current foundation. Vibrating color technique will be used for detail and realism.</p>
