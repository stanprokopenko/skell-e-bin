<h2>Early Love for Coloring</h2>

<p>Coloring has always been a part of my life. Like many, I started with coloring books as a kid. I dabbled in painting classes and art lessons, and eventually realized that traditional school wasn't for me. So, I went to art school and chose to major in sequential art, comics. Learning Photoshop back in the late '90s felt like an epic quest, but I was thrilled to explore digital art. It wasn't about becoming a colorist then, I was just excited to color my drawings digitally.</p>

<h2>Breaking into the Industry</h2>

<p>After art school, I was eager to find any job involving art to escape waiting tables and working at a commercial printer. I interviewed everywhere, and the opportunity that came through was assisting a colorist in his studio. I thought, **"This is something I know how to do and a place I'd like to live, let's go for it! # TEXT</p>

<p>I didn't anticipate that this would kickstart a 20-year career as a comic book colorist. Initially, it was just a temporary gig, but over five years, I progressed from flatting and archival work to coloring entire issues on my own. I started attending conventions, meeting peers trying to break into comics. I offered to color their projects for free, which led to low-paying jobs, and eventually, better opportunities. When some of those friends moved to Marvel, they recommended me, opening the door to bigger projects.</p>

<h2>Embracing Nature for Inspiration</h2>

<p>My wife and I love to hike and travel in our camper van. We spend months working remotely, exploring parts of the country we've never seen. <strong>Nature plays a significant role in my inspiration.</strong> I absorb the colors and make mental notes, often using them in my work. Sometimes, when I need fresh ideas, I'll search for images like sunsets to find new palettes.</p>

<h2>Favorite Characters and Settings</h2>

<p>My favorite Marvel character has evolved over time. As a kid, it was Spider-Man or Wolverine. Now, it's Thor because I've colored so much of his stories. <strong>I feel proud to be associated with that character.</strong> I also enjoy coloring Venom due to his cool design and iterations like Agent Venom.</p>

<p>I particularly love coloring natural settings, like the lush landscapes of Krakoa in the X-Men comics. <strong>Given the choice, I'd prefer natural landscapes over man-made structures.</strong> However, cityscapes at night, like in the Star-Lord miniseries set in New York, offer exciting opportunities with varied light sources and changing palettes.</p>

<h2>Battling Self-Doubt</h2>

<p>We're all our own biggest critics. I often see other artists' work and notice what they can do that I feel I can't. But I channel that into motivation to improve. <strong>When self-doubt creeps in, I block everything out and focus on doing the work.</strong> My art school training and years of practice have ingrained fundamentals that guide me instinctively.</p>

<h2>Dealing with Burnout</h2>

<p>Recognizing burnout signs early has been crucial. I used to get blindsided by it, but now I can anticipate it. <strong>I adjust by giving myself breaks and focusing on other aspects of life.</strong> For instance, I might take longer walks with my dog or spend more time outdoors. It's about finding balance without compromising work.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p>Whenever I feel unmotivated, I recall my grandpa's words: <strong>"It's better than digging ditches."</strong> I'm grateful for this career. Despite challenges, it's a great job, and I've come to appreciate that experience makes the work manageable and rewarding.</p>
