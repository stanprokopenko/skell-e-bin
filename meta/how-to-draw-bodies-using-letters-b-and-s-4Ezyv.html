<h2>Summarizing the Ribcage and Pelvis</h2>

<p>When drawing the figure, start by simplifying the <strong>ribcage and pelvis</strong> into a single, unified shape. Refer back to your proportion chart:</p>

<ul>

<li>The <strong>ribcage</strong> is typically <strong>two heads wide</strong>.</li>

<li>The pelvis extends down to about the <strong>fourth head length</strong>.</li>

</ul>

<p>Focus on capturing this combined shape without worrying about specific anatomical details like the thoracic arch or the exact separation between the ribcage and pelvis. This approach helps establish the foundation of the torso.</p>

<h3>Front and Back Views</h3>

<p>From the front, lay in the torso as one continuous shape. From the back, remember to account for the <strong>back of the neck</strong> by slightly extending the ribcage upwards. This offset creates a more accurate representation of the torso from behind.</p>

<p>Consider this shape as an <strong>average ideal</strong>, a starting point that you can <strong>customize later</strong>. Think about the variety of torso shapes you've explored in character lineups, the hero, the villain, the brute, all primarily differ in these three shapes.</p>

<h3>Side View Considerations</h3>

<p>In the side view, the focus shifts to the <strong>S-curve of the torso</strong>. While you can use the width of the head for alignment, prioritize the design based on the <strong>spine's natural curvature</strong>. There's no need to draw out every detail, understanding the underlying shapes allows you to design effectively.</p>

<h2>Using Symmetry and Landmarks</h2>

<p>Just like the head and neck, the torso has useful <strong>points of symmetry</strong> to help you maintain balance in your figure drawing.</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Center Line:</strong> Start by finding the <strong>pit of the neck</strong> and use it to establish a center line throughout the torso.</li>

<li><strong>Shoulder Line:</strong> Draw a line to represent the <strong>tilt of the shoulders</strong>. While the shoulders can move independently, simplifying them here aids in the initial design.</li>

<li><strong>Pelvic Tilt:</strong> Similarly, add a line at the bottom to indicate the <strong>tilt of the pelvis</strong>.</li>

</ul>

<p>These lines serve as coordinates, helping you to <strong>act out the action or gesture</strong> of the figure.</p>

<h3>From the Back View</h3>

<p>When drawing from the back:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Spine Line:</strong> Mark the <strong>seventh cervical vertebra</strong> at the base of the neck and draw the spine down to the pelvis.</li>

<li><strong>Shoulder Width:</strong> Indicate the width of the shoulders and the top of the scapulae.</li>

<li>These landmarks frame out the torso and assist in maintaining symmetry.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Tilting and Turning the Torso</h2>

<p>With your basic shape established, explore how the torso <strong>tilts</strong> and <strong>turns</strong>.</p>

<h3>Tilting the Torso</h3>

<p>To show tilting:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Side to Side:</strong> Tilt the shoulders and pelvis in opposite directions to create a dynamic pose.</li>

<li><strong>Front to Back:</strong> Tilt the torso forward or backward by adjusting the center line and curves.</li>

</ul>

<p>Experiment by <strong>pinching and stretching</strong> the shape to emphasize movement.</p>

<h3>Turning the Torso</h3>

<p>To show rotation:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Adjust the Center Line:</strong> Move the center line closer to one side to indicate the torso turning away from the viewer.</li>

<li><strong>Shoulder and Pelvic Tilts:</strong> Use the tilts to enhance the sense of rotation.</li>

</ul>

<p>Even small adjustments can convey significant rotation. Practice by drawing the torso with various tilts and turns to understand how these changes affect the overall pose.</p>

<h2>Modifying Torso Shapes for Character Design</h2>

<p>The basic torso shape serves as a foundation that you can <strong>modify</strong> to create different characters.</p>

<h3>Exploring Different Shapes</h3>

<ul>

<li><strong>Heroic Figures:</strong> Use an <strong>hourglass shape</strong> to emphasize broad shoulders and a narrow waist.</li>

<li><strong>Brute Characters:</strong> Consider an <strong>inverted triangle</strong>, widening the upper body and narrowing the pelvis for a top-heavy appearance.</li>

<li><strong>Slender Characters:</strong> Elongate and slim down the torso for tall, lean figures.</li>

</ul>

<p>By altering the proportions and shapes, you can express <strong>character traits</strong> and enhance the storytelling aspect of your art.</p>

<h3>Inspiration from Media</h3>

<p>Think about characters from movies or comics:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Hulk-like Figures:</strong> Exaggerate the upper body mass with smaller pelvises and legs.</li>

<li><strong>Villainous Sidekicks:</strong> Design torsos with unique shapes to reflect personality, such as a tall, thin torso for a cunning character.</li>

</ul>

<p>Use these modifications to communicate the essence of your characters visually.</p>

<h2>Summarizing the Legs</h2>

<p>Simplify the legs into basic shapes to capture their form and movement.</p>

<h3>Front View: The "B" Shape</h3>

<p>In the front view, the leg resembles a <strong>"B" shape</strong>:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Outer Curve:</strong> A <strong>big curve</strong> from the hip to the knee, representing the fullness of the thigh.</li>

<li><strong>Inner Line:</strong> A straighter line on the inside, simplifying the complex anatomy.</li>

</ul>

<p>This shape helps you establish the leg's gesture and proportion quickly.</p>

<h3>Side and Rotated Views: The "S" Shape</h3>

<p>When the leg is in profile or rotated, it takes on an <strong>"S" shape</strong>:</p>

<ul>

<li>Represents the natural swing from the back to the front of the leg.</li>

<li>Reflects the offset curves of muscles as the leg turns.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Bending the Leg</h3>

<p>For bent legs:</p>

<ul>

<li>Think of a <strong>triangle or arrow shape</strong>.</li>

<li>Emphasizes the sharp angle at the knee.</li>

<li>Captures the dynamic action of the leg.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Leg Shapes and Movement</h2>

<h3>Tilting and Turning</h3>

<p>Explore different leg positions:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Tilted Legs:</strong> Adjust the shapes to show tilting left or right.</li>

<li><strong>Rotated Legs:</strong> Modify the center line to indicate rotation.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Modification for Character Types</h3>

<p>Alter the leg shapes to reflect different characters:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Female Figures:</strong> Add more curves to represent the distribution of subcutaneous fat.</li>

<li><strong>Brute Characters:</strong> Exaggerate proportions with smaller legs to create a top-heavy look.</li>

<li><strong>Tall, Slender Characters:</strong> Extend and slim down the legs for an elongated appearance.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Connecting the Legs to the Torso</h3>

<p>Ensure the legs connect naturally:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Overlaps and Diagonals:</strong> Use overlaps or diagonal lines to show how the legs connect to the pelvis.</li>

<li><strong>Alignment:</strong> Consider the tilt of the pelvis and how it affects leg placement.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Summarizing the Arms</h2>

<p>Simplify the arms using basic shapes to capture their form and movement.</p>

<h3>The "S" Shape for Extended Arms</h3>

<p>When the arm is extended:</p>

<ul>

<li>Use an <strong>"S" shape</strong> to represent the flow from the shoulder down to the hand.</li>

<li>Emphasizes the natural curves of the arm muscles.</li>

</ul>

<h3>The Triangle Shape for Bent Arms</h3>

<p>When the arm is bent:</p>

<ul>

<li>Think of a <strong>triangle or arrow shape</strong>.</li>

<li>Highlights the bend at the elbow.</li>

<li>Captures the dynamic action of the arm.</li>

</ul>

<h3>From the Back View: The Axe Analogy</h3>

<p>In the back view, visualize the arm as an <strong>axe with a handle</strong>:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Axe Head:</strong> Represents the <strong>scapula (shoulder blade)</strong>.</li>

<li><strong>Axe Handle:</strong> Extends down as the <strong>upper arm</strong>.</li>

</ul>

<p>This analogy helps you understand the arm's structure and connection to the torso.</p>

<h2>Arm Shapes and Movement</h2>

<h3>Gesture of the Arms</h3>

<ul>

<li><strong>Raising or Lowering:</strong> Move the entire "axe" to show lifting or dropping the arm.</li>

<li><strong>Extended Positions:</strong> Use the "S" shape to convey fluidity and movement.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Modification for Character Types</h3>

<p>Adjust arm shapes to suit your character:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Muscular Figures:</strong> Thicken the arms for a bodybuilder look.</li>

<li><strong>Slender Figures:</strong> Slim down the arms for a delicate appearance.</li>

<li><strong>Brute Characters:</strong> Exaggerate the forearms and hands for a gorilla-like effect.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Connecting the Arms to the Torso</h3>

<p>Ensure a natural connection:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Front View:</strong> Start at points aligned with the shoulders.</li>

<li><strong>Overlaps:</strong> Use overlaps to create depth and a sense of connection.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Perspective in Figure Drawing</h2>

<p>Understanding perspective enhances the <strong>three-dimensionality</strong> of your figure.</p>

<h3>The Torso in Perspective</h3>

<ul>

<li><strong>Spinal Curvature:</strong> Remember that the <strong>ribcage comes forward</strong> due to the spine, and the <strong>pelvis goes back</strong>.</li>

<li><strong>Wrapping Lines:</strong> Use wrapping lines to indicate volume and direction.</li>

<li><strong>Asymmetry:</strong> Even in a standing pose, pushing the <strong>femur forward</strong> and the <strong>lower leg back</strong> adds depth.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Limbs in Perspective</h3>

<ul>

<li><strong>Legs:</strong> Adjust the shapes to show the leg coming forward or moving back.</li>

<li><strong>Arms:</strong> Consider how the arm extends towards or away from the viewer.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Simplifying with Shapes</h3>

<ul>

<li>Use simple shapes like <strong>rubber bands</strong> rather than rigid boxes or cylinders.</li>

<li>Focus on the overall gesture and movement without overcomplicating.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Bringing It All Together</h2>

<p>By combining these simplified shapes and concepts, you can create dynamic and expressive figures.</p>
