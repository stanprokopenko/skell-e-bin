<h2>Basic Connective Strategies</h2>

<p>I usually begin with <strong>curves</strong> and <strong>corners</strong> when I'm connecting two parts of the body. If both parts move in a similar direction, I use curves or S-curves. When they move in different directions, I switch to corners. The shoulders are a special case: even if arms and torso flow in a similar direction, I like to use a corner for clarity at the joint.</p>

<h2>Adding Overlaps and Interlocks</h2>

<p>Sometimes, curves and corners are not enough to show the three-dimensional articulation of the body. In those cases, I introduce <strong>overlapping forms</strong> like beanbags and drumsticks. These overlaps show a hierarchy of forms going back in space. They also create a more purposeful connection, adding a layer of depth and interest.</p>

<h2>Introducing Secondary Forms</h2>

<p>To form a better connection between primary forms, I often use <strong>secondary structures</strong>. On the shoulder girdle, this means using a few extra shapes, like an egg or bump, to refine how the arm and torso meet. It gives me more control over the silhouette and the way the forms interlock.</p>

<h2>Profile Views and Variations</h2>

<p>When dealing with a profile view, I can change how I connect the shoulder line to the arm:

- Use a simple curve off the torso into the arm.<br />

- Add one corner, or even two, to emphasize articulation.<br />

- Overlap shapes to create more dimension.</p>

<p>I like having choices. If the arm bends more than a right angle, it might need two corners for a clear joint. If itâ€™s a gentler bend, one corner or a simple curve can do the job.</p>

<h2>The Shoulder Girdle</h2>

<p>When the arms move in different positions, especially up and away from the body, the shoulder anatomy becomes more complicated. The simplest approach is to keep using curves and corners. But for a more <strong>characteristic</strong> look, I prefer adding minor shapes, those secondary forms, around the shoulder to fully capture its structure.</p>

<h2>The Value of Having Choices</h2>

<p>Every pose can be connected in various ways: corners, curves, overlaps, secondary shapes, or a combination of all. Having multiple strategies lets me pick the best option for each pose. It keeps the figure lively, organic, and clear.</p>

<p>I recommend exploring these different techniques, switch between a single corner, multiple corners, or an S-curve, to find what looks best in each pose. This flexibility is what makes figure drawing both efficient and expressive.</p>
