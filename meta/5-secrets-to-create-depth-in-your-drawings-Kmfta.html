<p>Flat piece of paper, world on the other side, big challenge! How do you trick the eye into seeing another dimension on a flat surface? You're probably familiar with vanishing points in perspective, but they are only one of <strong>five secrets</strong> to make a flat surface look <strong>three-dimensional</strong>. Let's explore these five ways to create the illusion of depth.</p>

<h2>1. Diminution: Things Get Smaller as They Go Away</h2>

<p><strong>Diminution</strong> means that objects appear smaller as they move away into the distance. When things get smaller, they don't necessarily look like they're going away, they might just look like they're shrinking. However, smaller objects can create the impression of being farther away.</p>

<p>Since we often look down on the world, small things higher up in the picture seem more distant. This is an old trick to create the illusion of depth. Remember, closer gets bigger, and farther gets smaller. It's why you can draw an airplane smaller than an eyeball if the eyeball is up close and the plane is in the sky. And it's why the sun, as big as it is, seems like the size of an eyeball to us.</p>

<h2>2. Convergence: Parallel Lines Meet at Vanishing Points</h2>

<p><strong>Convergence</strong> happens when parallel lines go away from your face and meet somewhere out there at a vanishing point. Every line on a box, for example, is one of three sets of parallel lines: up-down, left-right, and forward-back.</p>

<p>Here are some key points about convergence:</p>

<ul>

<li>When parallel lines recede, they converge at a vanishing point.</li>

<li>They may converge dramatically or subtly.</li>

<li>They may connect in the picture or out of the picture.</li>

<li>If lines don't go away from you, you see them as parallel.</li>

</ul>

<p>By drawing a starburst, you can lay out a city in <strong>one-point perspective</strong>. One set of lines goes away. If you draw two starbursts in any position, you can lay out a city in <strong>two-point perspective</strong>, two sets of lines go away. However many points you have, convergence happens when parallel lines recede.</p>

<h3>Convergence in Complex Forms</h3>

<p>In the complex world of organic forms, which seldom have parallel lines, convergence still plays a role. Understanding how convergence relates to these forms takes time and stages of understanding. But it's essential to solving many perspective problems.</p>

<h2>3. Foreshortening: Looking Along a Thing Changes Its Shape</h2>

<p><strong>Foreshortening</strong> is when a long object appears shorter because one end is closer to you. The object <strong>shortens</strong> as the end comes <strong>forward</strong>. It's a troublesome trick, if done poorly, a foreshortened object may just look confusing. But when done well, it gives a convincing sense of three-dimensionality.</p>

<p>Some key aspects of foreshortening:</p>

<ul>

<li>In a foreshortened position, close portions overlap portions behind them.</li>

<li>Foreshortening changes the appearance of proportions.</li>

<li>It's perhaps the most difficult of these five skills.</li>

</ul>

<p>To master foreshortening, you need to know how to draw objects in simplified forms and understand their positions in space.</p>

<h2>4. Overlap: Close Covers Distant</h2>

<p><strong>Overlap</strong> is the most basic trick. When something covers whatever is behind it, it is closer. This principle works in cartoons and is instinctive, even kids use it. Overlap is essential when drawing figures or natural forms.</p>

<p>Even with transparent objects like bubbles, edges will block out the objects behind them. No need to get scientific on overlap, it's simple and incredibly useful.</p>

<h2>5. Atmosphere: Distant Things Fade</h2>

<p><strong>Atmospheric perspective</strong> is about air. When there's lots of it, air creates atmosphere. Distant things fade because of the particles in the air, think of air as fog. That's why it's sometimes called <strong>aerial perspective</strong>.</p>

<p>Ways to use atmospheric perspective:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Lightening Lines</strong>: Make lines look like they go back into space by lightening them as they recede.</li>

<li><strong>Darkening or Bluing</strong>: In different environments, you can make things darker, bluer, or grayer as they disappear into the background.</li>

<li><strong>Creating Layers</strong>: Artists like Caspar David Friedrich use haze to create layers of depth.</li>

</ul>

<p>Atmospheric perspective allows you to deepen the illusion of space by adjusting the intensity and color of distant objects.</p>

<h2>Putting It All Together</h2>

<p>Let's review the five ways to create the illusion of depth:</p>

<ol>

<li><strong>Diminution</strong>: Farther away things look smaller, they diminish.</li>

<li><strong>Convergence</strong>: Parallel lines receding into space converge at a vanishing point.</li>

<li><strong>Foreshortening</strong>: Objects appear shorter when one end is closer to you.</li>

<li><strong>Overlap</strong>: Closer objects cover those behind them.</li>

<li><strong>Atmosphere</strong>: Distant objects fade due to particles in the air.</li>

</ol>

<p>You can use each of these methods alone, or combine them when drawing into that flat surface. Knowing these methods is only the start, each has a science behind it.</p>

<h3>The Role of Rendering</h3>

<p>There's a sixth trick called <strong>rendering</strong>. It involves shading to make things look real by smudging darks, lights, mid-tones, and patches of color, creating the appearance of three-dimensional forms. The logic of lighting a form comes from understanding the lines of the form, along, across, and around, through perspective lines.</p>

<p><strong>Cross-contour lines</strong> create structure for light, and they are perspective lines. Understanding cross-contour lines is essential, and although they don't come easily, you can master them with practice.</p>

<h2>Your Project</h2>

<p>Now that you know these methods for creating the illusion of depth, how will you use them?</p>

<p><strong>Here's your assignment:</strong></p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Look at your collection of favorite images.</strong></li>

<li><strong>Rate every image on a 1 to 5 scale</strong> for each of these depth tricks: diminution, convergence, foreshortening, overlap, and atmosphere.</li>

<li><strong>Post them on the lesson's assignment tab</strong> at proko.com.</li>

</ul>

<p>By analyzing your favorite artworks, you'll see how artists use these techniques to create depth. This exercise will also help you recognize which methods resonate with you and how you might incorporate them into your own work.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p>These five methods give you plenty to play with when creating the illusion of depth. You don't need to use every trick in a single picture, but having this list may remind you of a missing ingredient, or help you decide which one to emphasize. Remember, you don't need to play every card, <strong>play what wins</strong>.</p>

<p>Keep this list handy:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Diminution</strong></li>

<li><strong>Convergence</strong></li>

<li><strong>Foreshortening</strong></li>

<li><strong>Overlap</strong></li>

<li><strong>Atmosphere</strong></li>

</ul>

<p>Get these concepts into your brain, practice them, and see how they transform your art. Happy drawing!</p>
