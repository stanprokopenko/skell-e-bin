<p>In this guide, I'll walk you through the process of establishing shadows and light, mixing colors, creating backgrounds, and refining your painting. These techniques will help you achieve a balanced composition and enhance your painting skills.</p>

<h2>Establishing Shadows and Light</h2>

<p>To start, we use <strong>pre-mixed values</strong> for basic shadows. This sets a solid foundation for the painting. Next, we add <strong>average values for light</strong>, which is particularly beneficial when working on skin and flesh tones. This helps in achieving a more realistic look. It's crucial to <strong>compare these values</strong> to make better judgments about the overall composition.</p>

<h2>Color Mixing Techniques</h2>

<p>When mixing colors, I begin with <strong>ivory black</strong>, and mix it with <strong>alizarin and yellow ocher</strong>. I like to think of this as a <strong>ketchup and mustard analogy</strong>, a bit more black is added to balance the mix. To create contrast with flesh tones, I adjust the colors to shift towards green by reducing the red. This technique helps in achieving a harmonious color palette.</p>

<h2>Background Creation</h2>

<p>For the background, I apply <strong>random brushwork</strong> to give the appearance of a finished sketch. This technique not only adds depth but also makes use of any <strong>excess paint</strong> on the brush, avoiding waste. You can have fun with this by creating an <strong>abstract background</strong>. Adding more black and medium can give the background a <strong>transparent look</strong>, which can be quite striking.</p>

<h2>Tools and Techniques</h2>

<p>I often use a <strong>beat-up old brush</strong> for quick and rough application. This allows for a more spontaneous and dynamic approach. It's important to <strong>remove excess paint</strong> to prevent it from mixing with the flesh colors. I liken this process to using <strong>fine charcoal in drawing</strong>, where the shadow color acts as charcoal and the average light as a kneaded eraser.</p>

<h2>Refining the Painting</h2>

<p>The painting process is iterative. I plan to <strong>revisit and refine the work</strong>, blending edges and making adjustments as needed. This involves a <strong>back-and-forth play between shadow and light</strong> to refine shapes and achieve the desired effect. While reference photos are used, they mainly serve as a guide for values rather than dictating the entire composition.</p>

<p>By following these steps, you can create a painting that is both dynamic and balanced, with well-defined shadows, light, and background. Remember, the key is to experiment and have fun with the process!</p>
