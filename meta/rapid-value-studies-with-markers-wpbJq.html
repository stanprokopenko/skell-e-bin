<p>Hello everyone! In this session, I'm exploring value compositions by creating thumbnails using markers. I'll be working from a reference of a sculpture, probably Greek, of a man wearing a robe. This time, instead of pencils, I'm using markers to experiment with different value arrangements.</p>

<h2>Materials</h2>

<p>I'm using <strong>warm gray markers</strong> in values <strong>9</strong>, <strong>5</strong>, and <strong>3</strong>. I chose warm grays because the subject feels warm to me, but you can use cool gray or neutral gray, whatever you have on hand. The key is to have a few options of value to play with.</p>

<p>I also consider the <strong>white of the paper</strong> as an additional value, giving me a total of four values to work with. This setup allows me to manipulate the value range in my thumbnails.</p>

<h2>Setting Up the Value Range</h2>

<p>With these markers, I can adjust the range of values in my sketches. For some thumbnails, I might use:</p>

<ul>

<li>A <strong>9</strong>, <strong>5</strong>, and the <strong>paper</strong> for a broader range.</li>

<li>A <strong>9</strong>, <strong>5</strong>, and <strong>3</strong> to shift everything towards the darker values.</li>

<li>The <strong>paper</strong>, <strong>3</strong>, and <strong>5</strong> to keep everything lighter.</li>

</ul>

<p>This flexibility lets me explore different atmospheres and moods in my compositions.</p>

<h2>Starting the Thumbnails</h2>

<p>I plan to create thumbnails quickly, focusing on the <strong>major value masses</strong> without getting into details. I'll start with the <strong>3</strong> marker to lay down initial shapes.</p>

<p>When I squint at the reference, I see two main groups of light:</p>

<ul>

<li>The <strong>face</strong>.</li>

<li>The <strong>cloth on the shoulder</strong>.</li>

</ul>

<p>The darks are:</p>

<ul>

<li>The <strong>beard</strong> and <strong>hair</strong>, framing the light of the face.</li>

<li>The <strong>dark cloth on the other shoulder</strong>.</li>

<li>The <strong>background</strong>, which is more of a mid-tone.</li>

</ul>

<h3>First Thumbnail: Replicating the Photo</h3>

<p>I begin by sketching the head and the triangular shape of the shoulder cloth. I use the <strong>3</strong> marker for mid-tones and quickly lay in shapes using both the brush tip and the chisel tip for variety.</p>

<p>I realize that the mid-value I've chosen is too light, so I switch to the <strong>5</strong> to darken certain areas, like the eye sockets and the beard. This first attempt feels a bit boring and strange, so I decide to try something different.</p>

<h2>Experimenting with Value Arrangements</h2>

<h3>Thumbnail Two: Emphasizing the Face</h3>

<p>In this version, I make the <strong>face the only light shape</strong>, with the shoulder in mid-tone and everything else dark. I draw the head larger, filling the background with dark to make the face pop. I realize the composition needs more space above the head, so I adjust the framing.</p>

<h3>Thumbnail Three: Framing the Head</h3>

<p>I focus on the <strong>shape of the hair</strong>, which flows diagonally and creates interesting shapes. I decide to make the hair stand out more by leaving it as a mid-tone against a light background. I add space above his head and include some <strong>triangular shapes</strong> in the drapery to create tension.</p>

<h3>Thumbnail Four: Adjusting Shapes and Tension</h3>

<p>I continue to adjust the shapes, trying to <strong>frame the head</strong> better. I experiment with adding dark shapes to balance the composition but realize that sometimes <strong>unbalanced compositions</strong> can be more dynamic.</p>

<h3>Thumbnail Five: Lightening the Cloth</h3>

<p>I play with the lighting by making both shoulders light, reducing shadows on the drapery. I keep the composition tall and adjust the mid-tones to bring everything together. I add some dark shapes within the mid-tones to create a <strong>checkerboard effect</strong>, grouping elements and adding interest.</p>

<h3>Thumbnail Six: Strong Diagonal Dark Shape</h3>

<p>I attempt to create a strong <strong>diagonal dark shape</strong> across the composition by making the cloth dark. I realize that adding dark shapes elsewhere can detract from the main focus, so I keep the rest simple.</p>

<h3>Thumbnail Seven: Simplifying and Emphasizing Contrasts</h3>

<p>I revisit the idea of a strong diagonal dark shape but keep the background light, allowing the dark shape to stand out. I ensure that the area with the most contrast is around the face, where the viewer's eye is naturally drawn.</p>

<h2>Analyzing the Thumbnails</h2>

<p>Looking back at the thumbnails, I notice that the markers allowed me to move through ideas quickly. The initial thumbnails weren't great, but they helped me figure out the shapes I'm working with.</p>

<p>My favorite thumbnails are:</p>

<ul>

<li>The third and fourth ones, where I adjusted shapes and created tension.</li>

<li>The seventh one, where I emphasized contrasts and simplified the composition.</li>

</ul>

<p>I realize that sometimes you need to get the <strong>bad drawings out of the way</strong> to discover the good ones.</p>

<h2>Playing with Value Range</h2>

<h3>Thumbnail Eight: Low-Key Composition</h3>

<p>I decide to play with the <strong>value range</strong> by using darker markers. I use a <strong>7</strong> for the darks and make sure nothing is as light as the paper. This creates a <strong>low-key composition</strong>, where the lightest value is still relatively dark.</p>

<p>I introduce a fourth value, a lighter tone, only in specific areas like the face to create focal points. This experiment shows how adjusting the value range can dramatically change the mood of the composition.</p>

<h2>Choosing a Favorite and Next Steps</h2>

<p>Sometimes, picking a favorite composition is hard. I'm torn between three of my thumbnails:</p>

<ul>

<li>The third and fourth ones, where the shapes and tension work well.</li>

<li>The seventh one, which has a strong diagonal dark shape and emphasizes contrasts.</li>

</ul>

<p>If I were to take this further into a larger project, I'd enlarge my favorite thumbnails and create <strong>small color studies</strong> in oil paint or digitally. This would help me decide which composition works best before committing to a final piece.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p>This exercise shows how you can <strong>expand your creative bubble</strong> by experimenting with values and compositions. Values make a huge difference, and it's up to you how you manipulate them.</p>

<p>Remember, even if certain elements like the head have to stay recognizable, you have <strong>creative freedom</strong> with everything else. Play with shapes, values, and compositions to see where it takes you.</p>

<p>I hope you enjoyed this exploration, and I'll see you in the next one!</p>
