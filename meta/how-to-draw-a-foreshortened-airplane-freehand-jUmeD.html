<p>In this demonstration, I'll show you how to draw a foreshortened plane freehand. We'll focus on achieving correct proportions and perspective without relying on precise measurements. Let's dive in and create a dynamic airplane drawing step by step.</p>

<h2>Setting Up the Grid</h2>

<p>First, I start by drawing a <strong>grid</strong> to serve as a foundation for our perspective. I sketch out two <strong>vanishing points</strong>: one close by and a second one well off the page. This grid helps us establish the vanishing lines and gives structure to the drawing. I add vertical lines, slightly tapering them to enhance the perspective effect.</p>

<h2>Establishing the Basic Proportions</h2>

<p>I decide where to place the <strong>front face</strong> of the plane, marking it as a square in perspective. Using the grid, I estimate the depth of the plane, dividing it into sections. The front section is about one square deep, and the next two sections are roughly the same length. I adjust these divisions as needed, aiming for the correct proportions.</p>

<h2>Adding Taper and Perspective</h2>

<p>Next, I account for the <strong>tapering</strong> of the plane's body. The plane narrows towards the back, so I adjust the width accordingly. I draw lines from the front corners to the narrower back corners, creating the tapered effect. This step is crucial for achieving a realistic perspective.</p>

<h2>Detailing the Plane's Features</h2>

<h3>Drawing the Cockpit</h3>

<p>I add a dome on top of the plane to represent the cockpit. Centering it between the front and middle sections, I sketch an <strong>ellipse</strong> to establish its footprint. Using axes, I ensure the ellipse is at the correct angle and size. I then draw the dome rising from this base, forming a half-circle.</p>

<h3>Adding the Tail and Wings</h3>

<p>For the <strong>tail</strong>, I determine its position by finding the center of the back section. I draw it rising from this point, estimating its height and angle. The back wings are added next. I estimate their size and placement, ensuring they are symmetrical on both sides. Using the grid, I draw the wings extending outward and tapering back towards the tail.</p>

<p>The <strong>main wings</strong> are wider and thicker than the back wings. I estimate their length, which is about the depth of the whole plane. I draw them extending from the sides, using the grid lines to maintain perspective. I define the wings' thickness and taper them towards the tips.</p>

<h2>Refining the Drawing</h2>

<p>With the main structures in place, I begin refining the drawing. I clean up the lines, erase unnecessary scaffolding, and enhance the clarity of the form. I focus on making the lines deliberate and precise, emphasizing the plane's shape.</p>

<p>Finally, I add the front of the plane, sketching a <strong>propeller nose</strong>. I find the center of the front face and draw an ellipse to represent the propeller's base. Extending lines outward, I form the pointed nose of the plane.</p>

<p>Throughout the process, I make adjustments as needed, relying on estimation rather than precise measurements. The key is to observe proportions, maintain symmetry, and use the grid to guide the perspective.</p>

<p>Now we've successfully drawn a foreshortened plane in perspective. In the next lesson, we'll tackle a more daring position to further challenge our skills.</p>
