<h2>Why Visual Memory Matters</h2>

<p>Improving your <strong>visual memory</strong> enhances your ability to draw from imagination, draw faster, be more creative, and even helps when drawing from observation. A strong visual memory allows you to recognize patterns, identify important information, and compare reference images with what's in your mind. By training your visual memory, you'll better process and store complex information while drawing.</p>

<h2>Visual Memory Games</h2>

<h3>1. Draw from Memory</h3>

<ul>

<li><strong>Study a reference</strong> for one or two minutes.</li>

<li><strong>Hide the reference</strong> and draw it from memory.</li>

<li>Gradually <strong>decrease the viewing time</strong> as you improve.</li>

<li>After drawing, <strong>check your accuracy</strong> by comparing it to the reference.</li>

<li><strong>Extra challenge</strong>: Try drawing it again to improve.</li>

</ul>

<h3>2. Draw from a Different Angle</h3>

<ul>

<li><strong>Look at an object</strong> and <strong>draw it from a different angle</strong>.</li>

<li>Keep the reference visible; the goal is to <strong>imagine it in a new perspective</strong>.</li>

<li>Enhances your ability to <strong>visualize 3D forms</strong>.</li>

</ul>

<h3>3. Combine Them</h3>

<ul>

<li><strong>Study the reference</strong> for a few minutes.</li>

<li><strong>Hide it</strong> and <strong>draw it from memory and from a different angle</strong>.</li>

<li>For a slightly easier approach:<ul>

<li><strong>Create a study drawing</strong> while looking at the reference.</li>

<li><strong>Set aside both the reference and your drawing</strong>.</li>

<li><strong>Draw it again from memory</strong>, altering the angle.</li>

</ul>

</li>

<li>This method helps you <strong>learn the construction</strong> of forms and <strong>improve recall</strong>.</li>

</ul>

<h3>4. Level Two: Modify Proportions</h3>

<ul>

<li><strong>Use figure references</strong> and <strong>simplify them</strong> into mannequins.</li>

<li><strong>Draw from a different angle, from memory, and change the proportions</strong>.</li>

<li>This challenges you to <strong>redesign</strong> and <strong>create your own figures</strong> using the reference as inspiration.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Bonus Game: Draw from a Moving Subject</h2>

<ul>

<li><strong>Observe a moving subject</strong>, like animals at the zoo.</li>

<li><strong>Watch for a few minutes</strong> to understand basic forms.</li>

<li><strong>Mentally capture a pose</strong> and <strong>draw it from memory</strong>.</li>

<li>Use the subject as a <strong>live reminder</strong> of proportions and forms.</li>

<li>This exercise forces you to <strong>work quickly</strong> and <strong>adapt</strong> to changing views.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Assignments</h2>

<h3>Level One: Drawing from 3D Models</h3>

<ul>

<li><strong>Use provided 3D models</strong> accessible in your browser.</li>

<li><strong>Choose a game</strong> from the first three to practice:<ul>

<li>Draw from memory.</li>

<li>Draw from a different angle.</li>

<li>Combine them.</li>

</ul>

</li>

<li><strong>Focus on practicing perspective</strong> by constructing objects from simple primitives.</li>

<li><strong>Check your work</strong> by adjusting the 3D model to match your drawing angle.</li>

<li>Remember, the goal is to <strong>challenge yourself</strong> and <strong>improve visualization</strong>, not perfection.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Level Two: Drawing from Figure Poses</h3>

<ul>

<li><strong>Work from provided photo references</strong> of figure poses.</li>

<li><strong>Select one of the four games</strong> to apply.</li>

<li><strong>Simplify the poses</strong> into mannequins:<ul>

<li>Use <strong>gestural torso boxes</strong>.</li>

<li>Add <strong>cylinders for limbs and neck</strong>.</li>

<li>Choose a <strong>simple shape for the head</strong> (Loomis head, sphere, or box).</li>

</ul>

</li>

<li>Decide how to <strong>simplify hands and feet</strong>.</li>

<li>Continue playing these memory games beyond the course to <strong>enhance different skills</strong> like gesture, shapes, colors, and shadows.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Keep Practicing and Have Fun</h2>

<p>Embrace these challenges to <strong>strengthen your visual memory</strong>. The more you practice, the better you'll become at visualizing and drawing complex forms. So dive in, experiment with these games, and most importantly, <strong>have fun</strong>!</p>
