<p>Hi everyone, my name is Bryce Ko, and today I'm going to show you how I research an object that I don't know how to draw and maybe don't even have a great photo of. For me, I like to use a <strong>mnemonic approach</strong>, where I liken pieces that I don't really understand to things that I am familiar with because that makes it easier for me to understand what I'm looking at.</p>

<h2>Breaking Down the Bike</h2>

<p>In our reference photo, I have a couple of bikes parked along the side. <strong>Bikes are so hard</strong>. I really don't enjoy drawing bikes, but they look cool and add a lot of personality and atmosphere to a piece. So let's give it our best shot.</p>

<h3>Using Familiar Shapes</h3>

<p>With a bike, just like anything else, I'm going to try to <strong>break it down into shapes I understand</strong> and can replicate later. The front of the bike <strong>looks like the front of a biker helmet</strong> to me. Thinking of it that way, where there's a sharp helmet with horns, helps me remember what it looked like. If I can just get something close, then that's great.</p>

<p>It's like an <strong>alien helmet with antler ears sticking out</strong>. That's a shape I can remember because I've thought of it in terms that I do know. So if I ever wanted to draw a helmet again, I know I'm just drawing a human head shape with those large ears and antler ears, right?</p>

<h3>Continuing the Metaphor</h3>

<p>Continuing that metaphor, I think of the <strong>neck of this character and then the chest</strong>, going down. They put the license plate right up there, which is like the <strong>collarbone</strong>, and that's generally the way I think of it. In a mech of armor, it's jetting out like that, and the lights are like the <strong>pecs on a chest</strong>, but a bit more aggressive, at least on these speedier-looking bikes.</p>

<p>This chest comes to a more flat face, and then I have to start thinking about the <strong>use of this design</strong> and how it's being implemented on the bike. This appears to be the piece of machinery that <strong>connects to the wheel</strong>, obviously. When I'm drawing, I remember that I'm drawing this piece with the intention of a wheel being either laid into it or jetting out from it. In this case, it's conforming to the shape of that wheel.</p>

<h3>Understanding the Structure</h3>

<p>So this inner shape is going back like that. From the top, it looks like this, and that's <strong>underwear</strong>. These are legs. Okay, that's a long crotch, and that's the torso. This is my titan.</p>

<p>This is the next piece that we are trying to understand here. <strong>It is underwear</strong>. We're going to go with the sporty look, and the underwear <strong>houses the wheel</strong>. I'm not going to do anything with it, come on, guys! I can only go so far.</p>

<h3>Detailing the Wheel</h3>

<p>Here's our wheel. Maybe all vehicles have the cylinder connecting to the center of the wheel. You can tell I'm not a car-literate person, but that's okay. <strong>You don't have to be either</strong>. There are a lot of details, but I also know from experience that the inner part of the tire, like the hubcap or whatever, is so different that you don't have to memorize an exact one to get away with it.</p>

<p>You might want to study this one, or whatever one you're looking at, to get some ideas for what relationships or pieces make sense there. Having this extra cylinder with a bunch of extrusions and nail holes or screws, this is like <strong>language</strong>. This is <strong>texture</strong> that I might study and memorize, and then literally copy and paste anywhere I don't know what I should be doing. It will make it look cool, and it might be convincing enough.</p>

<h3>Quick Study of the Wheel</h3>

<p>Let's do a quick study of that. There's an inner... I wish I knew the language for this. It must sound so silly, but different cylinders there that we can imagine are where things get screwed in and tightened for the vehicle. There's an additional one here with more knobs to turn and tighten. It looks like it goes over the wheel a bit.</p>

<p>By zooming in, I'm also getting a sense that there's kind of a back cover to this, which may be the <strong>skirt of our human analogy</strong>. Yes, it covers but a little bit, okay?</p>

<h3>Simplifying Tire Textures</h3>

<p><strong>Tire textures are generally all the same</strong> insofar as, for an illustration, we only really need to memorize the fact that it has a pattern connecting to it and then usually a middle area. I'm not doing a fantastic job here, but this is research in which I'm noting the things to remember to include.</p>

<p>He's got a cool, very complicated pattern here. I don't think it's necessary for me to memorize that for this illustration because <strong>the bike is not the star</strong>. Just getting down the basics is definitely enough.</p>

<h2>Completing the Bike</h2>

<p>So we have the front of our bike, which could be enough for our purposes here.</p>

<h3>Adding the Back End</h3>

<p>Both of these bikes have a really <strong>big butt</strong> here for storage, I assume. So it's just this suitcase thing. It looks like it's connected via some rods here. We don't see enough to make very educated guesses at what it should be, but knowing that the shape ends with somewhat of a larger rounded-off box might be enough.</p>

<p>If I'm drawing it from this angle and think, okay, it just ends in a really big box there, as well as some kickstand-type pieces, what is that? I don't know if that's a wheel or not. I know from my vast knowledge that they usually have <strong>two wheels</strong>.</p>

<p>There's some cool machinery here that is very angular and uses some of the same language as the front but a lot flatter. Then, just assuming the wheel is there, this might be enough for my drawing to be convincing.</p>

<h3>Filling in the Middle Section</h3>

<p>I'm going to copy over what my understanding was here, which is it transitions into some angular flat surface shapes with kickstand pieces touching the floor. Then, I assume there's a wheel much like this front one on the back.</p>

<p>I'm missing this middle section. If I were to literally just connect the dots here and say, okay, it's probably a <strong>seat</strong>. I'm using my imagination and then just connecting what I'm seeing here. I know that this is a separated bump, so this doesn't have to connect exactly. But filling in this middle area with pieces of what I'm seeing to get the rough idea of a bike, that might be enough for what I need.</p>

<p>If I want to <strong>really know what I'm doing</strong>, which I don't know if I do for this purpose, then I can go ahead and study some more. But I think you get the idea of what I mean.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p>So that was a breakdown of how I do research. Just remember, guys, that this is a step you <strong>don't want to skip</strong> because it's building that foundational knowledge that you're going to use to play with when you get to the illustration. It's actually fun to draw from imagination.</p>
