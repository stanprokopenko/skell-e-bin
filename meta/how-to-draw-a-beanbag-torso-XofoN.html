<p>I like to think of the torso as a beanbag because the spine isn’t a single hinge. Each vertebra can articulate against the next, creating a bendy “accordion” effect. I can then simplify the torso into big, simple shapes, like two or three eggs or tubes. Sometimes I add the chest, stomach, or even the spare tire around the waist as extra forms. By mixing and matching shapes, I get a flexible concept that captures the way the torso stretches and pinches.</p>

<h2>Breaking Down the Torso</h2>

<p>When I examine a pose, I look for the <strong>stretch side</strong>, where the rib cage pulls away from the pelvis, and the <strong>pinch side</strong>, where everything compresses. If the model is sitting, the lower torso may flatten on the seat, like a beanbag pushed against the ground. I then plan out the shapes for:

- The <strong>rib cage</strong> and chest area.<br />

- The <strong>belly or waist</strong> region in between.<br />

- The <strong>hips or pelvis</strong> as the base.  </p>

<p>I can represent these shapes as eggs or bullet forms that overlap or tuck into each other.</p>

<h3>Eggs, Tubes, and Boxes</h3>

<p>I might choose three egg shapes stacked to represent the chest, belly, and hips, or I can use tubes or boxes if that makes more sense for the pose. Sometimes I’ll just pick two shapes (rib cage and hips) and then blend the middle. If I need more detail, I can keep splitting forms, adding overlaps to show how each shape presses or stretches.</p>

<h2>Overlaps and Stretch</h2>

<p>The most important part is to show where shapes <strong>overlap</strong>. The weight of the torso might squish one shape, creating a flatter, nipped-off form on the pinch side. On the stretch side, the shapes separate and create bigger spaces. This is where beanbags shine: they show tension where the spine stretches and a squish where the body compresses.</p>

<h2>Combining Beanbags with Drumsticks</h2>

<p>Sometimes, I’ll switch to a <strong>drumstick</strong> approach, which is all about a clear, interlocking insertion. But I can also combine beanbags and drumsticks. For example, I might use a beanbag for the torso and a drumstick for part of the leg attachment. It depends on which shape connection feels most accurate to the pose.</p>

<h3>Deep Perspective</h3>

<p>When I place these shapes in perspective, I imagine the rib cage, waist, and hips as eggs following a grid. I draw them as if they were three-dimensional objects receding in space. The overlaps then help me keep track of proportions. Even if I don’t know every anatomical detail, these simplified volumes give me an accurate roadmap.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p>By <strong>mashing up</strong> different shapes and <strong>overlapping</strong> them in a beanbag style, I can simplify a very complicated structure into two or three basic forms. This method lets me quickly capture the flow of the torso, without getting lost in the details. When in doubt, I step back and reduce it even more, just a couple of lines to show the stretch and pinch. That’s the power of the beanbag approach.</p>
