<p>In this lesson, we explore <strong>Melted Pancakes</strong>, a drawing approach that helps us understand perspective and organic shapes. Originally taught by <strong>Mr. Graber</strong> to seventh graders, this method allows us to create shapes that convey depth and realism in our drawings.</p>

<h2>The Two Methods of Drawing Melted Pancakes</h2>

<h3>Method 1: Using Center Lines and Wrapping</h3>

<p>We begin by drawing an <strong>organic shape</strong>, such as an irregular blob. Then, we:</p>

<ul>

<li>Draw a <strong>center line</strong> that goes across the shape.</li>

<li>Raise a line upward from the center line.</li>

<li>Wrap over the top of the shape by connecting the ends with a curved line.</li>

<li>Continue wrapping lines back over the top, curving them as needed.</li>

</ul>

<p>This creates a simple <strong>lump</strong> that we can draw through, adding dotted lines to show what's on the other side.</p>

<h3>Method 2: Drawing Walls and Mimicking Curves</h3>

<p>Alternatively, we can:</p>

<ul>

<li>Start with the same organic bottom shape.</li>

<li>Draw <strong>walls</strong> on the sides by copying the curves of the bottom shape.</li>

<li>Round the ends and connect the lines to form a three-dimensional shape.</li>

</ul>

<p>We again draw through the shape using dotted lines, allowing us to see its full form.</p>

<h2>Understanding the Horizon Line</h2>

<p>We introduce a <strong>horizon line</strong> to establish perspective. The horizon line represents our eye level. As shapes move relative to the horizon line, their <strong>elliptical angles</strong> change:</p>

<ul>

<li>Shapes below the horizon line show more of their top surfaces.</li>

<li>Shapes at the horizon line are flat, with no visible top or bottom.</li>

<li>Shapes above the horizon line show more of their bottom surfaces.</li>

</ul>

<p>By understanding this, we can accurately depict how shapes appear in space.</p>

<h2>Stacking Shapes and Creating Depth</h2>

<p>We can build upon the basic shapes by <strong>stacking them</strong>:</p>

<ul>

<li>Draw another organic shape above or below the first one.</li>

<li>Ensure that the curves correspond to their position relative to the horizon line.</li>

<li>Draw through the shapes using dotted lines to understand their connections.</li>

</ul>

<p>Stacking shapes helps us create scenes with depth, resembling natural formations like <strong>Bryce Canyon</strong> or the <strong>Grand Canyon</strong>.</p>

<h2>Drawing Through the Shape</h2>

<p>An essential part of this method is to <strong>draw through the shape</strong>:</p>

<ul>

<li>Use dotted lines to show hidden edges and surfaces.</li>

<li>Visualize how the shapes connect on the other side.</li>

<li>Never leave the shape incomplete, always consider its full form.</li>

</ul>

<p>Drawing through shapes enhances our understanding of three-dimensional form and improves our spatial awareness.</p>

<h2>Using Overlap to Convey Depth</h2>

<p><strong>Overlap</strong> is a powerful tool for creating depth:</p>

<ul>

<li>Place shapes in front of each other, partially obscuring the ones behind.</li>

<li>Use overlap intentionally to guide the viewer's eye through the composition.</li>

<li>Overlap helps distinguish between the <strong>foreground</strong>, <strong>midground</strong>, and <strong>background</strong>.</li>

</ul>

<p>By incorporating overlap, our drawings become more dynamic and engaging.</p>

<h2>Slicing Shapes at Angles</h2>

<p>We can add complexity by <strong>slicing shapes at angles</strong>:</p>

<ul>

<li>Draw a large organic shape.</li>

<li>Slice it with a line at an angle, like cutting through a piece of clay.</li>

<li>Erase the unnecessary lines to reveal the new surface.</li>

<li>Apply contour lines to emphasize the angled cuts.</li>

</ul>

<p>Slicing shapes creates variety and introduces different planes, making our compositions more interesting.</p>

<h2>Composition and Scaling</h2>

<p>Understanding <strong>scale</strong> and <strong>composition</strong> enhances our drawings:</p>

<ul>

<li>Use the <strong>transfer of scale</strong> to depict how objects appear smaller as they recede into the distance.</li>

<li>Consider the positioning of shapes to create a balanced composition.</li>

<li>Apply <strong>foreground</strong>, <strong>midground</strong>, and <strong>background</strong> elements to establish depth.</li>

</ul>

<p>By thinking about composition and scale, we make our drawings more realistic and visually appealing.</p>

<h2>Connecting Shapes and Guiding the Eye</h2>

<p>We can <strong>connect shapes</strong> to move the viewer's eye through the picture:</p>

<ul>

<li>Extend lines or curves from one shape to another.</li>

<li>Create pathways that lead the eye across the composition.</li>

<li>Use large shapes in the foreground to frame the scene.</li>

</ul>

<p>Connecting shapes unifies the composition and enhances the overall flow of the image.</p>

<h2>Practice and Mileage</h2>

<p>Improving our drawing skills requires <strong>practice</strong> and <strong>mileage</strong>:</p>

<ul>

<li>Regularly sketch and experiment with these techniques.</li>

<li>Don't be afraid of making mistakes, use them as learning opportunities.</li>

<li>Remember that each drawing helps us get better and more comfortable with the subject matter.</li>

</ul>

<p>By dedicating time to practice, we build confidence and improve our abilities.</p>

<h2>Exercises</h2>

<p>To apply these concepts, we can follow these steps:</p>
