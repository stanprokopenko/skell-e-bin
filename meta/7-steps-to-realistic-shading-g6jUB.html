<h2>Draw the Linear Layin</h2>

<p>Begin with a <strong>linear layin</strong> to map out shapes and establish gesture, perspective, and anatomy. This serves as a guide for where to place your values and colors. Even for a simple sphere, start by sketching a circle to define your space.</p>

<h2>Map Out the Form Shadow</h2>

<p>Identify the <strong>terminator</strong>, where light transitions to shadow. This is the point where the planes start to face away from the light source. Imagine an equator around the sphere facing the light direction, and sketch the core shadow, which usually aligns with the terminator.</p>

<h2>Map Out the Cast Shadow</h2>

<p>Understand that <strong>cast shadows</strong> differ from form shadows. Cast shadows occur when one object blocks light from reaching another surface. They help create relationships between objects and can convey form by following the cross-contour lines of the surface they fall on.</p>

<h2>Separate Light and Shadow</h2>

<p>Fill in the form shadow with a consistent dark value to separate it from the light areas. Use a value dark enough to show clear contrast but not pure black. This initial shadow value represents the lightest shadow values, including <strong>reflected light</strong>. Include the cast shadow in this same shadow mass.</p>

<h2>Refine the Core Shadow and Reflected Light</h2>

<p>Recognize that light bounces off surfaces, creating <strong>reflected light</strong> in the shadows. However, reflected light should always be darker than any halftone in the light areas. To create reflected light, darken the <strong>core shadow</strong>, which is the darkest part of the form shadow near the terminator. The core shadow appears darker because it receives less reflected light.</p>

<h2>Model the Halftones</h2>

<p>Focus on the <strong>halftones</strong>, the planes that receive light at an angle. Determine the position of the <strong>center light</strong>, where the surface faces the light source directly. Halftones transition from the center light toward the shadow, getting darker as the angle steepens. Avoid making the gradation linear, most of the value change occurs near the terminator.</p>

<h2>Design the Highlight</h2>

<p>Add the <strong>highlight</strong> as a finishing touch. Highlights are reflections of the light source and depend on the viewer's position. They are usually the brightest spots and appear sharper on glossy surfaces. Place the highlight closer to the core shadow than the center light. Remember, your forms should feel solid even without the highlights.</p>

<h2>Deepen the Occlusion Shadow</h2>

<p>Enhance the <strong>occlusion shadow</strong>, the darkest part where little or no light reaches. It's often found where objects touch surfaces or are very close together. Darkening the occlusion shadow grounds the object and adds depth. As the cast shadow extends outward, it gradually lightens as more reflected light reaches it.</p>

<h2>Fade the Penumbra</h2>

<p>Notice the <strong>penumbra</strong>, the soft edge of the cast shadow. It's created because light sources have size, causing a gradient at the edge of the cast shadow. Fade the penumbra to realistically render the shadow's edge. Don't just give the cast shadow a hard outline unless the situation calls for it.</p>

<h2>Make Final Adjustments</h2>

<p>Step back and review your drawing. Ensure all elements, lights, shadows, halftones, highlights, and edges, work together harmoniously. Adjust values and transitions as needed to enhance the realism. Focus on the relationships between values, rather than individual spots.</p>

<h2>Assignment</h2>

<p>Now it's your turn to practice. <strong>Shade a sphere</strong> following these steps. Focus on getting the value relationships correct and creating a clear separation between light and shadow. Remember, the key is in the relationships, not individual areas.</p>
