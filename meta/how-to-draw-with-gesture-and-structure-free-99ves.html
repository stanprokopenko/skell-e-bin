<h2>What's in Premium?</h2>

<p>This lesson focuses on two essential concepts in figure drawing: gesture and structure. You’ll see how to establish a long axis curve and then simplify forms into tubes, boxes, and egg shapes for clarity in proportions and flow. We break down each body part—head, torso, arms, and legs—so you can confidently adjust or correct as you go. This approach smoothly transitions into more refined rendering and advanced techniques like filters and iterations.</p>
