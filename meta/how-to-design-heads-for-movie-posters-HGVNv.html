<p>Hi, I'm Chris Legaspi, a professional movie poster artist, author, and instructor. Today, I'll share how I design heads for movie posters. In this industry, every poster must grab your attention, and <strong>design</strong> is the key tool to achieve that.</p>

<h2>The Importance of Design</h2>

<p>As artists, we need to draw faces and characters <strong>very well</strong> and be <strong>very fast</strong>. Design helps us be fast, accurate, and capture that <strong>killer likeness</strong>. Our main responsibilities are to <strong>get the likeness</strong> and <strong>communicate the story and feeling</strong> of the movie.</p>

<h2>Organizing Shapes</h2>

<p>Design is about <strong>organizing shapes</strong>. When designing heads and faces, I focus on three main shapes:</p>

<ol>

<li>

<p><strong>Primary Shapes</strong>: Major shapes like the <strong>outline</strong>, <strong>silhouette</strong>, and <strong>contour</strong>. This includes the <strong>head type</strong>, reflecting the character or actor.</p>

</li>

<li>

<p><strong>Secondary Shapes</strong>: <strong>Planar shapes</strong> such as the <strong>eye sockets</strong>, <strong>nose</strong>, <strong>mouth</strong>, and <strong>hair</strong> relative to the face.</p>

</li>

<li>

<p><strong>Detail Shapes</strong>: Smaller shapes of <strong>light and dark</strong>, especially naturally dark areas like <strong>eyebrows</strong>, <strong>pupils</strong>, and shadows under the <strong>nose</strong> and <strong>lips</strong>.</p>

</li>

</ol>

<h2>Putting It All Together</h2>

<h3>Choosing References</h3>

<p>Start with faces that have <strong>obvious head types</strong>, clear, sharp, rectangular, or round shapes. This eases the learning process.</p>

<h3>Step-by-Step Process</h3>

<ol>

<li>

<p><strong>Major Shape</strong>: Begin with the <strong>outer shape</strong> - the <strong>silhouette</strong> or <strong>contour</strong> - to define the character and 2D space.</p>

</li>

<li>

<p><strong>Head Type</strong>: Determine the general shape of the face, e.g., <strong>rectangular and long</strong>.</p>

</li>

<li>

<p><strong>Secondary Shapes</strong>: Identify <strong>major planes</strong>: side plane, cheek, planes of the eye sockets, nose, and mouth. Note the shape and thickness of these features.</p>

</li>

<li>

<p><strong>Detail Shapes</strong>: Focus on <strong>light and dark shapes</strong>, high-contrast areas like <strong>eyebrows</strong>, <strong>pupils</strong>, shadows under <strong>eyelids</strong>, <strong>nostrils</strong>, and small shadows around features.</p>

</li>

<li>

<p><strong>Finishing</strong>: Fill in shapes with tone, adding halftones and transitions. Clearly define what's <strong>light</strong> and what's <strong>dark</strong> to show form.</p>

</li>

</ol>

<h2>Practice Exercises</h2>

<p>To improve, try these exercises:</p>

<ol>

<li>

<p><strong>Warm-ups</strong>: Sketch head types and shapes. <strong>Exaggerate</strong> them to get warmed up.</p>

</li>

<li>

<p><strong>Study the Contour</strong>: Train your eye to see the <strong>outer shape</strong> or <strong>silhouette</strong>. Draw contours without detail. Keep them small to do many.</p>

</li>

<li>

<p><strong>Poster Vision</strong>: Once comfortable with silhouettes and head types, add <strong>detail shapes</strong>, light and dark areas like brows and shadows under the nose. Keep it simple, using only black and white.</p>
