<h2>Simplifying the Torso</h2>

<p>When drawing the torso, think of the <strong>ribcage and pelvis as one shape</strong>. Start by sketching a single form that represents both structures. In ideal proportions, this shape spans from the top of the second head to the fourth head in your <strong>proportion chart</strong>.</p>

<p>Use <strong>symmetry lines</strong> to help with the structure. The <strong>pit of the neck</strong> serves as a useful center point for the front view. Draw a line for the <strong>shoulder line</strong> and one for the <strong>pelvic tilt</strong> to indicate the orientation.</p>

<p>From the back, focus on the <strong>spine</strong> as your center. Mark the <strong>seventh cervical vertebra</strong> and trace the spine down to frame your torso. Use these lines to understand the <strong>tilt and turn</strong> of the torso.</p>

<h3>Gestures and Movement</h3>

<p>Experiment with tilting, pinching, and stretching the torso shape to convey movement. Adjust the <strong>shoulder line</strong> and <strong>pelvic tilt</strong> to show different gestures. Use the <strong>center line</strong> to indicate rotation, shifting it off-center suggests the torso is turning.</p>

<h3>Modifying for Character Types</h3>

<p>Customize the torso shape to reflect different characters. For a hero, you might use an <strong>hourglass shape</strong> for the torso. A brute character could have a broader upper body with a narrower pelvis. Play with proportions and shapes to emphasize character traits.</p>

<h2>Simplifying the Legs</h2>

<p>Represent the legs using <strong>basic shapes</strong>. In the front view, think of the leg as a <strong>"B" shape</strong>:</p>

<ul>

<li>From the hip, draw a <strong>big curve</strong> outward for the outer thigh.</li>

<li>Pinch inward around the knee.</li>

<li>Curve outward again for the calf, narrowing down to the foot.</li>

</ul>

<p>In profile or three-quarter views, use an <strong>"S" shape</strong> to capture the leg's natural curves. The <strong>center line</strong> shifts to one side, showing rotation.</p>

<h3>Gestures and Movement</h3>

<p>When the leg bends, it often resembles a <strong>triangle</strong> or <strong>arrow shape</strong>. Use these shapes to depict flexed positions. Remember to consider how the leg connects to the pelvis, create overlaps or diagonal connections to show this relationship.</p>

<h3>Modifying for Character Types</h3>

<p>Adjust leg shapes to match your character. For a female figure, you might enhance the curves for a more voluptuous look. For a brute character, you could exaggerate the size of the thighs or calves. Modify the basic shapes to suit the body type.</p>

<h2>Simplifying the Arms</h2>

<p>For arms, use <strong>"S" shapes</strong> for extended positions and <strong>triangles</strong> for bent positions. From the back, think of the arm as an <strong>axe with a handle</strong>:</p>

<ul>

<li>The <strong>shoulder blade</strong> forms the axe head.</li>

<li>The <strong>upper arm</strong> is the handle.</li>

</ul>

<p>Connect the arms to the torso by starting at key points, like the shoulder line. Use overlaps and flowing lines to integrate the arms smoothly.</p>

<h3>Gestures and Movement</h3>

<p>Extend the arm by following an <strong>"S" curve</strong> that flows into the hand. For bent arms, use a <strong>triangle</strong> or <strong>arrow shape</strong>. These shapes help convey common arm positions and movements.</p>

<h3>Modifying for Character Types</h3>

<p>Adjust the arm shapes based on your character. Make arms bulkier for a muscular figure or thinner for a slender character. The shapes can be distorted to reflect mass and type.</p>

<h2>Adding Perspective with Wrapping Lines</h2>

<p>Use <strong>wrapping lines</strong> to give your shapes a sense of space and volume. These lines follow the contours of the forms and help indicate perspective. Even simple wraps can provide spatial recognition without complicating your drawing.</p>

<h2>Putting It All Together</h2>

<p>By simplifying the <strong>torso</strong>, <strong>legs</strong>, and <strong>arms</strong> into basic shapes, you can quickly lay in the figure's proportions and gestures. Experiment with tilting, rotating, and modifying these shapes to convey movement and character. Use wrapping lines to add depth, and focus on the flow and connection between parts. With practice, this approach can enhance your figure drawings and help you capture the essence of different characters.</p>
