<h2>Pushing Extremes in Foreshortening</h2>

<p>In some of these examples, I want to push the extreme use of foreshortened aspects of the lines and their push. For instance, when drawing a head, it might look close to the norm we have been discussing. But by seeing the rib cage shift away and the pelvis shift back, we create more in and out movement. In this case, I focus on <strong>shortening these lines</strong> to the degree that I want them to go away more quickly, and then I emphasize the wrap. The pelvis does the opposite, opposite in the wrap but the same principle in terms of making the line shorter.</p>

<p>For the arm, the length might be just that long. In terms of following through for gesture and getting that perspective, the lower arm may only be that long. When these start to feel a little bit more challenging or you're getting into the weeds of difficult aspects of posing, keep in mind the goal. There's a reason that you're working to do this, because you want to put Kratos killing a new god in a really cool position with his elbow coming directly at the camera. This is challenging to learn right now, but the reward of having learned it is that you'll be capable of showing so much more range in terms of not just the figure feeling rhythmic top-down, but towards and away from the camera.</p>

<h2>Maintaining Rhythm and Gesture</h2>

<p>There's still the rhythm. The animated, active, fun, lyrical movement hasn't left, it's just gotten knotted. I'm trying to work slowly and shorten these lines, but at no point is my rhythm going away. I haven't lost that, it's still very much foregrounded for all the reasons that we started. That's something to just make sure you keep always cognizant of. Just little reminders, I do it all the time.</p>

<h2>Asymmetry in 3D Space</h2>

<p>Sometimes, instead of just being parallel, parts of the figure come closer. So now we're starting to move the figure toward the camera or the leg, and then another part goes back. The same principle applies: get that same length, match the femur above, but then start to push that. It's a little bit different from the previous examples but involves more space and more foreshortening.</p>

<h3>Dealing with Straight-On Poses</h3>

<p>One of the most common questions I get is, "How do I do it when it's straight on?" Well, there are lots of options:</p>

<ul>

<li>Draw it as is.</li>

<li>Push asymmetry in the back and forth - the 3D asymmetry.</li>

<li>Change it. What's wrong with changing it? Why not turn it a bit or try to create some movement if you feel like it's lacking?</li>

</ul>

<p>Maybe you play with an asymmetry of tilts in the shoulders. The shoulders have their own unique expressive quality. On your gestures, you could include a tilt line for the shoulders. Try experimenting with that, it's really fun.</p>

<h2>Drawing from the Inside Out</h2>

<p>When I'm drawing these lines, my intention is never to close off shapes. All of my lines are always intended to be somewhat on the inside because I anticipate building to the contour. When I was learning this as a student, my challenge to myself was, <strong>"You can't draw the contour unless you know what it is."</strong> ** The outside isn't just the shape, it's an extension of everything you know on the inside.</p>

<p>Whenever I'm doing these lines, I'm anticipating my build to end somewhere out there. I can slowly creep up on it because it's hard, and sometimes I need that forgiving aspect to a drawing. Not everybody does, but I definitely do.</p>

<h2>Using Ellipses to Show Depth</h2>

<p>In foreshortened limbs, I'm relying quite a bit on the technical aspect of the drawing to get the forward and back in space. What might be helpful is to start getting comfortable drawing ellipses. All the foundation exercises would be probably awesome for that. Practice ellipses and get comfortable doing them. Sometimes, ellipse exercises involve gradually opening them or angling your plane and building ellipses in. I'm relying on that to show wraps and depth.</p>

<h2>Employing Line Weight for Emphasis</h2>

<p>As you get more comfortable, start to treat your gestures as compositions. <strong>Line weight could be a way to direct the eye somewhere.</strong> For example, you could tell the viewer about the importance of a leg by pushing some darker lines. Start to treat these now as compositions or exercises in compositions. Then you're really starting to think of them as plans for what you might develop.</p>

<h2>Balancing the Figure and Showing Weight</h2>

<p>Think of how your poses are maintained, how weight works. If you have a mass that is leaning one way, without something to support it, it is going to fall over. Sometimes that's a fun way to think about how your poses are maintained. Maybe the figure is suspended in terms of weight, between two points. Understanding this can help you solve poses in which the weight distribution is challenging.</p>

<h2>Changing Poses to Add Interest</h2>

<p>Your options could be to draw the pose as is, push asymmetry, or change it. If the pose feels static or uninteresting, why not change it? Maybe turn it a bit or try to create some movement if you feel like it's lacking. Perhaps you can play with an asymmetry of tilts in the shoulders or hips. Maybe you can invent a different position based on a couple of parts.</p>

<p>The history of painting is largely painters going to the museum, looking at existing compositions, and then riffing off of those figures and compositions. Those painters weren't accused of plagiarism. They're taking and playing with conventions.</p>

<h2>Handling Symmetrical and Straight-On Poses</h2>

<p>For symmetrical poses or straight-on views, remember that the spine would always be doing what the spine does, which is, to a certain extent, counterbalance your three core masses so that you can move. If you feel like there's not enough turn or if it's symmetrical, then really push the perspective asymmetry. Push that one part comes forward. It's not the best, but it's good enough to get you moving onto the next step.</p>

<h3>The Importance of the Gesture</h3>

<p>People get stuck with this front and back idea because they start to adopt the thought that the gesture is the end of the drawing. It's just notational, it's just for you to get started, to develop. If this were the end of the drawing, that would be weird. That's too much pressure. There's a whole list of steps that would come after this, where I would take this from my loose lay-in to a finished drawing. So, it's just what you need to understand that position.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p>I hope this discussion and draw-through of our basic poses helps give you a sense of how to take what we know or what we started out with, and aim it at some poses that aren't exactly friendly from the standpoint of their space or foreshortening. I tried to systematically go through issues in each pose, whether it's the seated pose or the forward bend, and then introduce slightly more complicated issues of perspective push forward or back in terms of limbs in space.</p>

<p>I probably always end with symmetry, back and front, just so that we make people comfortable with that as a view. Remember, when the drawing is notationally done for you, it's done. There's no gesture police or anybody that's going to come say, "You need to do a little bit more here," or "You really blew it on that shoulder," or "Doesn't look like the pose." When you feel like it's good, it's good. You've solved your forward lean, you have a sense of how you would build this forward.</p>

<p>Gesture is notational so that you have all this information to give to things that you would like to draw. Keep practicing, keep pushing those extremes in foreshortening, and keep the rhythm alive in your work.</p>
