<p>Let's look at a variety of ways that early 21st-century artists work and get a lesson or three from them.</p>

<h2>Wes Wheeler's Approach to 3D Art</h2>

<p><strong>Wes Wheeler</strong> is a 3D artist who draws before he models and then draws back over the models to make them look drawn again. You may think this is cheating. It is. It cheats time and it serves the viewer, so it's cheating where everyone wins.</p>

<p>Notice what he has in common with artists who do this without the computer: <strong>He works out multiple options before committing to one</strong>. Wisdom.</p>

<h3>The Role of 3D Modeling in Learning Perspective</h3>

<p>Now, let me talk about this 3D model business. <strong>Building 3D models does not take knowledge of perspective, but it does take knowledge of a 3D program</strong>. The program uses perspective, and we're here to understand how.</p>

<p>You will use 3D programs if you go into the image-making industry. Part of this course is learning to think like a 3D program and at least learning to sketch with 3D awareness using the computer as we choose, like Wes does.</p>

<h2>Polina Ristova: Blending Traditional and Digital Methods</h2>

<p><strong>Polina Ristova</strong> designed Dracula's carriage by looking at funeral cars, drawing lots of little thumbnails, then drawing these orthos, which I'll teach you about in a coming episode. Like Wes, she went right into building it in Maya, making her own custom reference. Then she drew a new version on bond paper.</p>

<p>But when she studied at Art Center, she drew this entirely by hand on paper the old way, no computer, which is how I recommend you to begin. It's not a case against digital, and we need to be clear on what we mean by digital.</p>

<p>Polina did these demos for her students digitally, but with a 2D program, Photoshop, to show students how the theory works.</p>

<h3>The Difference Between Traditional and Digital Tools</h3>

<p><strong>The difference between traditional pencils and digital pencils is not that big</strong>. It's like the difference between walking and running. But the difference between pencil drawing and 3D modeling is the difference between walking and space travel.</p>

<p>Humans landed on the moon when I was nine years old. I saw it on TV. But I did not give up walking or drawing by hand.</p>

<p>Polina put it this way: <strong>"We use 3D programs to get to our result faster, not as an excuse not to learn the basics."</strong> Hear, hear.</p>

<h2>Vance Kovacs: Exploring Options with Digital Tools</h2>

<p><strong>Vance Kovacs</strong> paints concept art for movies. Vance took perspective from me in the early 1990s before the days of digital. Then he pioneered a career in digital.</p>

<p>When I tried to pin him down on how he works, he said <strong>every job is different</strong>. A job can start with discussion, research, sculpting, or shopping. But eventually, every job goes through the computer, and he often starts with rough sketches to work out composition and basic perspective choices like point of view.</p>

<p>A lot of his process is <strong>exploring options</strong>, not settling for the first try. Digital lets you track your stages in case you decide to go back.</p>

<p>Vance learned perspective back in the 20th century. Now he generates lots of images quickly for his living, so he uses whatever he needs, including digital tools, to get the job done. But much of it is based on traditional drawing and painting.</p>

<p>Well, you are here to get much more than prospective students could get back in the 20th century. Good timing on your behalf. That's Vance Kovacs.</p>

<h2>Israel Sanchez: Traditional and Whimsical Perspectives</h2>

<p>Let me show you another former student who works many different ways. <strong>Israel Sanchez</strong> took classes with me in the late nineties and has gone on to a varied career of illustration, children's books, advertising, comics, and art directing TV animation.</p>

<p>Like all the artists I've shown you so far, Israel works in stages more than what we see here, but this makes the point, and there is another reason I want to show you his work.</p>

<p>We see in Israel's work <strong>two very different approaches to perspective</strong>:</p>

<ul>

<li>One is <strong>traditional perspective</strong> that nobody notices because it looks right.</li>

<li>The other is <strong>whimsical perspective</strong> to make something that looks childlike.</li>

</ul>

<p><strong>Artists who know perspective can defy perspective when they decide an image looks better without it.</strong> That's what's happening here.</p>

<p>Before he became a professional, he did this piece titled "With a Word I Can't Say." I love this drawing. Look at that scooter. <strong>Grown-up skill, kid energy.</strong></p>

<p>Israel Sanchez uses perspective to make a cartoon come to life.</p>

<h3>Balancing Primitive and Sophisticated Drawing</h3>

<p>If you want your picture to look playful and childlike, you may use primitive drawing. If you want it to look convincing, you'll probably use sophisticated drawing.</p>

<p>So what's the best way to work? It depends on what we're trying to do. <strong>We decide how to work.</strong></p>

<p>But notice that Israel, Vance, Polina, and Wes work in a way common to most professionals. <strong>They work in stages to solve one problem at a time, and they are not held back by lack of skill.</strong></p>

<h2>Dan Fraga: Mastery Without Planning</h2>

<p>Speaking of skill, let's look at one more professional who takes it to the other extreme. <strong>No stages at all.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Dan Fraga</strong> drew this without any planning in real time for my students. This is a sped-up version, but the full 45-minute version was totally worth sitting through.</p>

<p>Dan has been drawing for a long time as a planning professional in comic books, but this is his <strong>off-road approach</strong>. Dangerous for beginners.</p>

<p>Follow him if you dare at Couch Doodles.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p>Let's conclude this magnificent display of skill with a reminder that we are here to learn perspective. <strong>Our first purpose is not to create masterpieces, but to reach mastery so we can create masterpieces later.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Skills first.</strong></p>
