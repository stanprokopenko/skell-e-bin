<h2>Understanding Value in Art</h2>

<p>To make your drawings look three-dimensional and create the illusion of form, you need to add <strong>values</strong> to your drawings. A <strong>value</strong> is simply how light or dark something is. Unlike lines, which are abstractions, values represent the light as it affects form in reality.</p>

<h2>Value and Color</h2>

<p>In reality, we see light as an arrangement of colors, which are made up of <strong>hue</strong>, <strong>chroma</strong>, and <strong>value</strong>:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Hue</strong>: The family of colors, like red, yellow, or blue.</li>

<li><strong>Chroma</strong>: How pure or gray a color is.</li>

<li><strong>Value</strong>: The lightness or darkness of a color, from white to black.</li>

</ul>

<p>For artists, the most important aspect of color is <strong>value</strong>. Focusing on value helps you capture the light and form of your subject.</p>

<h2>The Value Scale</h2>

<p>Imagine a scale from zero to ten, where zero is the darkest black and ten is the brightest white. This <strong>value scale</strong> helps you measure and communicate light and dark in your drawings.</p>

<p>In practice, artists often break down the infinite gradation between black and white into about ten steps. This makes it easier to work with, and describe specific values. You don't always have to use all ten values, sometimes you might work with a limited range to achieve different effects in your art.</p>

<h2>Values in Drawing</h2>

<p>Think of a drawing like building a house:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Lines</strong> are like the framework.</li>

<li><strong>Values</strong> are like the walls that fill in the spaces, creating solidity.</li>

<li><strong>Values</strong> create the illusion of form, depth, and volume.</li>

</ul>

<p>As a beginner, it's wise to practice drawing without color at first. By focusing on value, you can concentrate on understanding light and form before introducing other elements like texture and color.</p>

<h2>Sources of Value</h2>

<p>Four factors determine the values you see:</p>

<ol>

<li><strong>Local Value</strong>: The inherent lightness or darkness of an object, regardless of lighting.</li>

<li><strong>Light on Form</strong>: How light affects an object based on its form and the angles of its planes.</li>

<li><strong>Surface Material</strong> (more advanced)</li>

<li><strong>Atmosphere</strong> (more advanced)</li>

</ol>

<h3>Local Value and Light on Form</h3>

<p>Focus on local value and light on form to understand how values work together. For example, a red apple and a yellow apple in the same light will have different values due to their local colors. The light side of the red apple is darker than that of the yellow apple, and the shadows also differ.</p>

<h2>Practice with Values</h2>

<p>Training your eyes to see subtle shifts in value is crucial. Start by working with values to represent light and shadow effectively. Once you're comfortable, you can expand your range and introduce color for more emotional impact.</p>
