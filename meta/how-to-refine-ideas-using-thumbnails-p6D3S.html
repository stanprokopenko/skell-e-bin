<h2>Exploring a New Idea</h2>

<p>Now that I've wrapped up the first thumbnail, I live by the saying that <strong>no idea is a good idea if it's the only one you have</strong>. So I'm going to move through here and do a second thumbnail to see where that can take us. This time, I want to explore the idea of the Fantastic Four <strong>working on something together</strong>.</p>

<p>We previously looked at the family fun side of things, with them taking some downtime and enjoying themselves. But now we're going to get <strong>back to work</strong>. My idea is that they're all collaborating on a machine that Reed is building.</p>

<h2>Incorporating a Retro Flying Saucer</h2>

<p>I've always been a big fan of the <strong>hovercraft or flying saucer</strong> type of sci-fi trope. So that's what I'm going to go for. Reed's building one, getting it working and putting it all together, and everyone's giving him a hand.</p>

<p>I want the flying saucer to have a <strong>retro sci-fi</strong> feel, maybe looking like a <strong>World War II-era flying saucer</strong>. I just really get a kick out of that. I'm going to place the flying saucer <strong>up here</strong>, making sure it's not tangent with the title, possibly passing <strong>behind the title</strong> because I have some ideas for that. I'm definitely incorporating the title more into this piece.</p>

<h2>Sketching Ben as the Lift</h2>

<p>I'm starting off with <strong>Ben</strong> because I see him as being more central, occupying a lot of space. I'm thinking that maybe Ben will act as the <strong>lift</strong>, he's raising the craft up off the ground. I'm starting to get a kick out of this, he's so strong that he's <strong>holding up the ship with one arm</strong>.</p>

<p>Then I'm envisioning he's got a <strong>coffee cup</strong> in his other hand. He's just casual about being the strongest dude around.</p>

<h2>Placing the Other Characters</h2>

<p>Now I'm going to sort of place everything else around this. I always start too <strong>claustrophobic</strong>, so I almost always have to shrink things down. That's okay, that's the nice thing about digital. When I used to work traditionally, my frames would just keep getting bigger and bigger, but with digital, I can adjust easily.</p>

<h3>Reed Richards at Work</h3>

<p>This is going to be <strong>Reed</strong>, and he's up here using his <strong>stretchy powers</strong> to work on both the top and the bottom simultaneously. Maybe he's got one hand working on the top, and his other arm coming down here. I like the weird contradiction, so maybe he's holding just an <strong>old-school wrench</strong>.</p>

<h3>Sue Storm's Assistance</h3>

<p>Sue has Reed's <strong>toolbox</strong>, and she's <strong>elevating it up</strong> to him. I have to figure out some way to place her in the image because we're running out of space here. Still keeping it loose right now.</p>

<h3>Adjusting for Tangents</h3>

<p>I'm running into some tangents down here, so I need to adjust. If I want this, I'm going to have to move that hand up. But if I move that hand up, it starts running into the head, so then I have to move the head over.</p>

<p>This is thumbnails, so that's okay. Avoiding tangencies and getting good overlap is a fine line to walk, especially when you've got so many things overlapping.</p>

<h2>The Importance of Thumbnails</h2>

<p>That's why you do <strong>thumbnails</strong>. You might have an intent, you might have a plan in mind, but as the famous saying goes, <strong>no strategy survives engagement with the enemy</strong>. Thumbnails help you work through these challenges.</p>

<p>If I'm looking for a quick turnaround, I'll often tell clients they're getting my <strong>figure coming out of the dark shtick</strong>, which eliminates a lot of design problems. But when you have the time, it's important to work through the complexities.</p>

<h2>Adding Johnny Storm to the Scene</h2>

<p>As I said, I think <strong>Johnny</strong> is going to be providing <strong>refreshment support</strong>. He's coming in here and going full Rockwell, really pantomiming that walk. He's leaning back, heel first, and he's got a tray of refreshments.</p>

<p>Maybe he's even heating up the tray with his <strong>flame powers</strong>, and it's tea, hot cocoa, or something along those lines. Over here, he's handing one of those refreshments to Ben, who is delicately taking it with his <strong>tea fingers</strong>. I like that, I think that's going in a really good direction.</p>

<h2>Adjusting Scale and Placement</h2>

<p>At this point, I've got a pretty good idea of whether it's working or not. I want to make sure that Johnny's in <strong>scale</strong>. He's on about the same plane as Sue is, so maybe he'd be a little bit bigger, but roughly about the same size.</p>

<p>I'm happy here. The big thing that I'm having to avoid with this is, again, those pesky <strong>tangents</strong>. Still maybe feeling a little bit claustrophobic, so I adjust accordingly.</p>

<h2>Adding Values and Design Elements</h2>

<p>Now I have my <strong>value scheme</strong> here, but I think I'm going to simplify it to a <strong>true three-value</strong> scheme. I'm going to place that <strong>Fantastic Four logo</strong> in between Reed and the spaceship. It mimics that circular motif, which is really nice.</p>

<p>I'll create a layer behind my drawing layer, and lock all of this in as a big mask. From a design standpoint, just almost as an abstraction, this has got some pleasing things happening, really cool little negative shapes that are just appealing.</p>

<h3>Embracing Happy Accidents</h3>

<p>It's hard to explain why that is, and maybe not everyone would agree. Some people might say it's busy, but I think it's that right balance. Again, <strong>harmony and unity and diversity</strong> in a piece, that's one of the things that is important to me, something that I'm always looking for.</p>

<p>If everything is a solid, uniform construction, it feels very solid but also a little boring. But you start punching some holes and stuff, and it starts becoming more interesting. You punch too many holes, and it just becomes a mess.</p>

<p>It's like designing a tree canopy, you want it to hold together enough that it looks like a tree shape, but you don't want it to end up looking like a head of broccoli.</p>

<h2>The Value of Planning</h2>

<p>Again, that's why you do thumbnails. You can plan that stuff and hope for the best, but until you actually see it down on the screen or on the page, you just don't know.</p>

<p>If you approach it like many of us did when we were in high school, where you just sort of get out a piece of paper and start drawing, you might come up with something cool, but it's going to have a lot of problems. They almost always did, right? We all remember being frustrated with that stuff and going, why didn't this come out the way that I wanted? It's because <strong>you didn't have a plan</strong>.</p>

<p>Even if you want it to appear unplanned, <strong>you need to have a plan</strong>. And even when you have a plan, you need to be open to <strong>happy accidents</strong>. Sometimes those end up being better than what you did plan.</p>

<h2>Adding Color to the Composition</h2>

<p>Maybe what we can do here, just to kind of cap this off real quick, is go in and do a quick <strong>color comp</strong>. This can be real quick and dirty because my color comps usually are.</p>

<h3>Developing the Color Scheme</h3>

<p>I'm going to use a <strong>color layer</strong>, and we'll just come in here with a real heavy <strong>blue base</strong>. I see this being not really monochromatic, in fact, everything's going to have a blue tinge to it. Even the oranges that I end up popping in there are probably going to end up being more slightly dingy than the blue.</p>

<p>Obviously, their outfits are blue, so that's pretty straightforward.</p>

<h3>Adding Complementary Colors</h3>

<p>Now I'll go back to my color layer, find the right <strong>orange</strong> that I want. We'll keep it on a separate layer, so we can adjust that. That's got a good feel to it, we've got a nice <strong>complementary color scheme</strong>.</p>

<p>The values break up well. That's a good thumbnail that I'd be totally comfortable sending in to an editor or artist.</p>

<h2>Preparing for the Next Phase</h2>

<p>Our next phase will be to take one of these two sketches, I'm leaning towards this one, and we'll take that and I'll take Ben and bring him up to more of a finish. Then we'll finish up with the oil painting.</p>

<h3>Gathering References</h3>

<p>At this point, this is when I would actually go in and <strong>shoot some reference</strong>, gather my scrap reference. I mentioned that with that ship, I would want that to have a <strong>World War II bomber aesthetic</strong>, so I'd go and get a bunch of that type of reference.</p>

<p>Find some reference for the rocky skin of Ben, hire a model, shoot some reference, photograph the <strong>coffee cups</strong>, really get down so that anything that I need, I've got. I don't want to get stuck halfway through a painting going, "I don't know what a coffee cup looks like." You always think you do, that seems like a silly thing, but having that reference right in front of you and seeing how that porcelain takes the light is really, really useful.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p>So, we've developed our second thumbnail, explored different composition ideas, adjusted for tangents and scale, added values, and even done a quick color comp. I'm really digging how it's turned out.</p>

<p>Next, we'll continue on in Procreate, take this sketch up to more of a finish, and then move on to the <strong>oil painting</strong>.</p>
