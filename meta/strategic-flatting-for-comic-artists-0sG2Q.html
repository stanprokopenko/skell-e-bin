<p>Alright, let's dive into flatting. I want to encapsulate my approach across any pages. This isn't art style specific or story specific, it's just a way to talk about <strong>problem-solving</strong> when you approach a page or an issue.</p>

<p>When you're given a script, it's filled with a lot of words and usually has comic art with a lot of things going on. Comic stories typically take place within one issue, containing about five or so scenes. Each of these scenes presents particular problems for you to solve.</p>

<p><strong>Working with intention</strong> is key. If you just go with the flow, coloring one panel after another, you might set yourself up for failure and have to redo things later. Even if you don't need to redo anything, you might be leaving something on the table and missing out on the most impact from a page turn or a reveal panel.</p>

<h2>Approaching a Page</h2>

<p>I look for places where <strong>story beats</strong> are happening, where there's a big impact visually throughout a scene. Pinpoint those so you can work towards them and work around them.</p>

<p>For example, throughout a conversation, the tension might be rising. If you look at the artwork in black and white, it's the same drawing over and over, two heads, medium shot, characters talking. Maybe the facial expressions change some, but broadly speaking, it is the same drawing across the page.</p>

<p>However, when you read the script, the meaning behind what they're saying is changing. That's an opportunity to <strong>express the change in mood</strong> through color. If you've read the script and looked at the art ahead of time, you can make big decisions across the whole page or scene. You can look for places to shift the colors and alter the mood.</p>

<h2>Flatting the First Panel</h2>

<p>For this demo, we're going to work on the first panel, the big celestial frozen in ice. I'm looking for <strong>big, easy shapes</strong> that I can knock out. Rectangles are super easy, not a lot of curves to follow, so I can just go straight across.</p>

<h3>Selecting Panels</h3>

<p>In this case, I'm selecting panels two and three by using the lasso tool, and then I'm selecting the inverse to get the whole background panel. I fill it with a light blue.</p>

<p>I check for any gaps in the line art, filling them with gray to cover places where the line art isn't clean. This ensures that the selection isn't messy when I use the wand tool.</p>

<h3>Using the Wand Tool</h3>

<p>I go to my wand tool and click <strong>Sample All Layers</strong>. This samples both my line art layer and the layer I'm working on. I make sure <strong>Contiguous</strong> is checked on because I don't want it grabbing a crazy amount of stuff.</p>

<p>You can see from the marching ants showing my selection that I've got the sky, but it's made a little mess around the mountain due to some bits in the inks. I expand the selection a couple of pixels to get a better result.</p>

<h2>Working Background to Foreground</h2>

<p>I'm working <strong>background to foreground</strong> in this case. After doing the sky, I move on to the mountains in the background, and then I'll start working on the frozen celestial.</p>

<h3>Flatting the Mountains</h3>

<p>For the mountain just on this side of his head, the artist has put in some rendering and tones. The wand method might not work as well here.</p>

<p>I take my lasso and work my way around his shoulder. Then I use the wand tool, hold down <strong>Alt</strong> or <strong>Option</strong> to minus it out, and then I've got the mountain. I use <strong>fill 100% foreground color</strong> which I've set to an action, so I can fill it quickly.</p>

<h3>Using Fill Percentages</h3>

<p>I've set up actions to fill at different percentages, like <strong>40% fill</strong>. Instead of 100%, 40% looks like this. This is a trick I found useful when flatting, to quickly fill at lower opacities. I can assign these actions to mouse buttons or keyboard shortcuts, which speeds up the process.</p>

<h2>Flatting Techniques</h2>

<h3>Dividing Planes</h3>

<p>For the mountain ranges, I divide them into two planes. I use 40% fill to create separation between the planes, which helps with <strong>atmospheric perspective</strong>.</p>

<h3>Using the Wand and Line Art</h3>

<p>I use the wand and the line art to my advantage. I sample all layers and use the wand to select areas, then expand the selection to get under the lines. This saves time and keeps the flats clean.</p>

<h2>Flatting the Ice</h2>

<p>Next, I'm going to flat the ice. There are a lot of straight lines and not as many curves, so I can use the lasso tool efficiently.</p>

<h3>Selecting Around Existing Flats</h3>

<p>Since I've already flatted the sky and mountains, I can use them to my advantage. I can select over them and then minus them out, so I don't have to worry about tracing this outer line again.</p>

<h3>Simplifying Details</h3>

<p>I focus on the <strong>major planes</strong> of the ice, the top and the sides. I don't need every crack and facet to be a different color, because it would complicate things later. I want to make selections that will be useful in the coloring process, allowing for easy adjustments.</p>

<h3>Using the Polygonal Lasso Tool</h3>

<p>I prefer using the <strong>Polygonal Lasso Tool</strong> because when I lift my stylus from the screen, it doesn't close my selection. It also lets me make quick straight lines, which is helpful for the straight edges of the ice.</p>

<h2>Organizing Colors</h2>

<p>I keep two colors ready in my foreground and background colors, swapping between them with the <strong>X</strong> key. This allows me to quickly fill areas with different colors.</p>

<h3>Flatting the Foreground Ice</h3>

<p>I sometimes break my background-to-foreground rule if I see an easy area to tackle, like a piece of foreground ice that's quick to accomplish.</p>

<h2>Flatting the Celestial</h2>

<p>After flatting the ice, I move on to the celestial. I might leave him gray for now and do all his eyes and details, then put in his main color later. I'm careful to keep my flats <strong>neat and clean</strong>.</p>

<h3>Separating Planes</h3>

<p>I consider making his arm a slightly different color from his face and torso to <strong>create depth</strong>. However, I don't want to overdo it by making each joint a different color.</p>

<h3>Using Tools Efficiently</h3>

<p>I use the lasso tool for intricate selections and take advantage of the <strong>Shift</strong> key to add to a selection. I also use the <strong>Alt</strong> or <strong>Option</strong> key to turn my pencil tool into an eyedropper for quick color selection.</p>

<h2>Combining Tools</h2>

<p>Sometimes, I combine tools to save time. For example, if an area has messy crosshatching, I might fill gaps in the line art on my flats layer to create a clean selection area for the wand tool.</p>

<h2>Tips for Efficiency</h2>

<ul>

<li>

<p><strong>Use Actions</strong>: Set up actions for common tasks like filling at certain percentages to speed up your workflow.</p>

</li>

<li>

<p><strong>Assign Shortcuts</strong>: Assign actions to mouse buttons, keyboard shortcuts, or stylus buttons for quick access.</p>

</li>

<li>

<p><strong>Work from Background to Foreground</strong>: This helps in organizing the image and makes flatting more efficient.</p>

</li>

<li>

<p><strong>Simplify Selections</strong>: Don't overcomplicate your flats by adding unnecessary detail. Focus on major planes and areas that will be useful in the coloring process.</p>

</li>

<li>

<p><strong>Use the Polygonal Lasso Tool</strong>: It offers advantages like not closing the selection when you lift the stylus and allowing for quick straight lines.</p>

</li>

<li>

<p><strong>Keep Flats Neat</strong>: While speed is important, maintaining clean flats is crucial. Messy flats can cause issues later in the coloring process.</p>

</li>

</ul>

<h2>Common Pitfalls</h2>

<ul>

<li>

<p><strong>Spending Too Much Time</strong>: On a typical page, if you're spending more than 45 minutes flatting, you're probably spending too much time. Efficiency comes with practice and developing your own system.</p>

</li>

<li>

<p><strong>Overcomplicating Flats</strong>: Adding too much detail in your flats can slow you down and complicate the coloring process.</p>

</li>

<li>

<p><strong>Ignoring Important Areas</strong>: Don't miss out on opportunities to enhance the image by not considering depth and separation of planes.</p>

</li>

</ul>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p>Flatting is about <strong>defining the space</strong> and organizing the image from big to small. Start by finding the <strong>focal point</strong> of each panel and think about how to highlight it. By working efficiently and intentionally, you can save time and set yourself up for success in the coloring stage.</p>

<p>Remember, the techniques I've shared are how I do it, but they're not the only way. It's all about mixing and matching methods to find what works best for you. The goal is to make the coloring process smoother and more efficient.</p>
