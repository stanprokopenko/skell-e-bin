<p>Welcome to our critique on the plan projection assignment. We explored how to create plan projections of various objects and discovered some shared challenges. I want to recognize the hard work and dedication everyone put in. Plan projections can be intense, but they’re an important gateway into understanding perspective on a deeper level.</p>

<h2>Fixing the Video Errors</h2>

<p>I need to address the fact that there were four errors in the lesson videos, three of which involved tracking heights. I tried my best to eliminate mistakes, but I realize these issues caused confusion for many of you. I apologize for the frustration. This material demands a lot of concentration, and I acknowledge that my promise of “perspective without brain damage” didn’t always come true. Thank you for your patience as we worked to resolve these errors.</p>

<h2>Approaches and Student Examples</h2>

<p>Many of you tackled this assignment step by step and shared useful insights. I especially want to highlight the benefit of starting simply, then moving on to more complex shapes. Some of you took on intricate forms right away, like vehicles, pencil sharpeners, and boxes with open lids, which added extra difficulty.</p>

<h3>Step by Step</h3>

<p>“Step” demonstrated that any corner can be used to determine height if you transfer that height to the picture plane. Once you pick a corner, it dictates the height for every other corner. If that’s confusing, you can look at Step’s slides for clarity. Remember, if it feels overwhelming, simplify the form.</p>

<h3>Simple vs. Complex Forms</h3>

<p>Some of you picked objects with wheels, curves, or heavy tilts and got caught in a riptide of details. Others started small, one step at a time. Both approaches are valid, but if you’re struggling, consider breaking shapes into right angles first. Add curves only when you feel comfortable with your foundational projections.</p>

<h3>The Diagonal Trick</h3>

<p>Dan (the animator) showed us the speed and efficiency of using a diagonal line to transfer measurements from one view to another. Another student pointed out you can flip the diagonal in the opposite direction if you’re using a different side view. It’s an elegant shortcut for accurate measurement.</p>

<h3>Collaboration and Peer Help</h3>

<p>A few of you, such as Seat a rabing, ran into trouble with incompatible orthos. Thanks to Anthony Hernandez and others, those issues got resolved. This was a great example of healthy peer support, everyone pitching in with advice when needed.</p>

<h2>Notable Submissions</h2>

<p>I saw many standout works:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>AMU</strong> shared a clear illustration and admitted that the process made their brain hurt.  </li>

<li><strong>Mon Barker</strong> struggled to find interesting objects without curves but succeeded admirably anyway.  </li>

<li><strong>Maggie B</strong> tackled a church, then revised mistakes to align the vanishing points.  </li>

<li><strong>O Not</strong> showed a before-and-after comparison, highlighting how important it is for vanishing points to conform to the object.  </li>

<li><strong>Sandra</strong> borrowed ideas from Anthony and produced an extremely readable one-point projection example.  </li>

<li><strong>Brandon</strong> pushed the limits with a complicated piece. The biggest takeaway is the 60-degree field of vision guideline, so your object fits comfortably without heavy distortion.  </li>

<li><strong>Randy</strong> spent three to four hours on a small project, proving it can be time-intensive even for simple-seeming drawings.  </li>

<li><strong>Rupert</strong> devoted about eight hours to projecting a pencil sharpener in multiple positions, which was an impressive feat.</li>

<li><strong>Stka</strong> spent two full days on their piece, finding it addictive and engaging despite the mental strain.</li>

</ul>

<p>Some of you discovered that you enjoy the meticulous nature of plan projections, and that’s wonderful. Others, like Van Gogh and Frida Kahlo, never used such precise methods, and they produced timeless art. Knowing how to do this is an option, not a requirement.</p>

<h2>Putting It All Into Perspective</h2>

<p>We’re nearing the conclusion of Part One, which focused on the science of perspective. You’re now able to decide if you want to pursue more master-level specifics or if you’d rather keep things looser. Like cooking without full-blown chemistry, you can draw good art without rigid plan projections.</p>

<p>We’ll soon explore more creative approaches to perspective, including wide-angle viewpoints and what we can learn from photography. If plan projections discouraged you, take heart, there’s a big shift coming. If they excited you, you’ll have even more fun with the next lessons.</p>

<h2>Looking Ahead</h2>

<p>Next, I’ll demonstrate two more plan projections where the picture plane is very close. I encourage you to watch them visually, perhaps with the sound off. You already know enough to follow the logic on your own. We’ll then move on to broadening our perspective skills in a more intuitive way.</p>

<p>Our final lessons in Part One will pull insights from photography: a medium that can be simultaneously easier and harder for perspective work. The camera does a lot automatically, but it also locks us into certain distortions. We’ll learn from those distortions and apply that understanding to our drawings.</p>

<p>I hope you feel ready to keep exploring perspective, whether you dig deep into the technical side or prefer a simpler, more intuitive approach. It’s all about finding what suits your vision and style.</p>
