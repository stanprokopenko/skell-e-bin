<p>Welcome to this guided demo on how to sculpt a life-size hand from life. In this part one, I'll show you how to go from the armature to the initial stages of the sculpting process. We'll be using eight gauge aluminum wire and clay.</p>

<h2>Preparing the Armature</h2>

<p>Choosing the right wire thickness is crucial. I'm using eight gauge aluminum wire, which is a good thickness. If you have thinner wire, I recommend doubling up and twisting them together. This thickens the wires and gives the clay something to grab onto.</p>

<p>Measure out the length from three-quarters down the forearm up to your hand. Twist the wires together, making little X shapes. You can also braid four wires together, switching off two and two with the ends of the wires. Once braided, stick a fifth wire in between and wrap it tightly around.</p>

<h2>Arranging the Wires</h2>

<p>Shape the wires to resemble a hand, aligning them with your own fingers. Use your hand as a reference to ensure proper alignment. Mark where you need to cut off the excess wire with pliers or wire cutters. Shorten the wires to match the proportions of your hand. The goal is to have a life-size armature.</p>

<h2>Finding the Joints</h2>

<p>Start with the thumb joint. Use the middle finger to find knuckle positions: half the distance of the middle finger is the first knuckle, half of the remaining distance is the second knuckle, and half of that is the third knuckle. Bend the wire to mark these joints.</p>

<h2>Securing the Armature</h2>

<p>Attach the armature to a base using a half-inch metal floor flange and a metal pipe. Secure it with metal hose clamps. Ensure the armature is tightly secured and not moving around.</p>

<h2>Adding Newspaper and Tape</h2>

<p>Fill areas with newspaper to save on clay. Wrap the paper with masking tape. You can also use aluminum foil, but I prefer masking tape as it doesn't stick to the clay as much. Adjust the armature before adding clay to ensure the pose is exactly what you want.</p>

<h2>Applying the First Layer of Clay</h2>

<p>Use thin, large pancake pieces of clay and press them onto the surface. Smooth out the clay. Constantly check your hand reference. This clay is Chavant Medium NSP, but any type of clay can work.</p>

<h2>Building Up the Fingers</h2>

<p>Add a thin layer of clay to cover the wire, giving you a base to build secondary forms on. Focus on primary forms and anatomy. Add lines of clay to represent tendons and knuckles. Sculpt thin and build up the mass slowly and thoughtfully.</p>

<h2>Developing the Silhouette</h2>

<p>Create walls of clay to represent the side and front views of the fingers. Build up the thumb and fingers, ensuring accurate proportions and angles. Think about the silhouette from different angles and build walls of clay to represent these views.</p>

<h2>Adding Anatomical Details</h2>

<p>Indicate the ulna and tendons. Build up fat pads and muscles. Constantly check your hand reference. Pay attention to how the forms wrap around the fingers and connect to the side profiles.</p>

<h2>Final Adjustments</h2>

<p>Round off forms thoughtfully, considering how they transition from one angle to another. Connect silhouettes accurately. Ensure primary forms are correct before adding details. Think about the underlying bone structure and how it affects the surface forms.</p>
