<p>In painting, <strong>planes</strong> are the flat areas on a head that help create a <strong>solid and structural light effect</strong>. Understanding planes is crucial for adding depth and form to your work. During a demo on edges, I realized that incorporating planes could enhance the lesson by showing how they relate to halftones.</p>

<h2>Edges and Halftones</h2>

<p>Initially, I focused on <strong>edges</strong> and their limitations. Edges alone can't provide the extra dimension of form that <strong>halftones</strong> can. By adding halftones, planes become more apparent, allowing for a transition from light to halftone and creating depth.</p>

<h2>Demonstration of Value Changes</h2>

<p>I demonstrated how <strong>value changes</strong> reveal form through the <strong>lightest light, darkest dark, and halftones</strong>. Using a limited palette of pre-mixed halftones, I explored how planes work in relation to these values. Pre-mixed paint, though initially a hassle, becomes invaluable later.</p>

<h2>Mixing and Applying Halftones</h2>

<p>I created intermediate halftones by mixing dark halftones with lighter ones to form three different planes on a head. I focused on applying halftones to small planes under the eye, using shapes to avoid randomness.</p>

<h2>Brush Size and Shape Design</h2>

<p>Using the right <strong>brush size</strong> is essential to feel the form and create <strong>geometric, well-designed shapes</strong>. This approach helps in maintaining control and precision in your painting.</p>

<h2>Challenges with Complex Subjects</h2>

<p>Painting subjects with <strong>wrinkly skin</strong> presents a challenge due to the numerous halftones involved. It can be difficult to paint with just one value and two edges. Despite the complexity, working with such forms is rewarding.</p>

<h2>Enhancing Form with Halftones</h2>

<p>Adding halftones to an edges-only approach enhances the form, allowing for more detailed rendering. I demonstrated how to draw planes on the forehead and side of the head, emphasizing the textbook nature of these changes.</p>

<h2>Techniques for Capturing Skin and Planes</h2>

<p>To better capture the subject's skin and planes, I considered adding <strong>darker halftones</strong>. Applying thick paint with strokes creates harder edges, which may require additional edge work. I used shadow colors to add values without blending, focusing on rendering rather than blending.</p>

<h2>Enhancing Depth and Form</h2>

<p>I created a new step of value for lighter planes, enhancing the form's depth. Reestablishing shadow shapes and adding vibrating color further enhanced the illusion of form. I added glow to the light pool on the forehead, transitioning from halftones to lighter planes.</p>

<h2>Advanced Concepts and Techniques</h2>

<p>I introduced the concept of <strong>crest lights</strong>, where two planes meet, creating a ridge-like effect. Consistency with pre-mixed halftones is key to maintaining balance and avoiding going too dark. I considered adding gray to areas needing it, using pre-mixed values to maintain consistency.</p>

<h2>Focus on Light and Halftones</h2>

<p>I focused on halftones and light, avoiding shadows, as the story of the form is in the light. The subject's sparse eyebrows blended with halftones, creating lost edges. Describing my process while working quickly was challenging, often leading to unrelated babbling.</p>

<h2>Rendering and Creative Freedom</h2>

<p>Rendering is important, and it's crucial to have fun with the process. Using limited tools allows for a focus on form. As an artist accustomed to a full palette, I found freedom in using limited colors, avoiding distractions from unnecessary colors.</p>

<p><strong>Values and edges</strong> work together beautifully, allowing for creative freedom when combined with nice shapes. This exercise was a fun exploration of form and values, demonstrating the power of limited tools in painting.</p>
