<p>Values are awesome! If you want your drawings to look <strong>three-dimensional</strong> and create the <strong>illusion of form</strong>, you need to start adding values to your line drawings. Lines are great and get us far, but learning how to effectively use values can transform your art. Later, when we combine them with edges, it will feel like magic!</p>

<h2>Understanding Value</h2>

<p>When we talk about <strong>value</strong> in art, we're not referring to its 'worth' or how much money it costs. A value is simply how <strong>light or dark</strong> something is. If we take a photo and make it grayscale, you can see that the skin is lighter than the lips. Even though the color of the lips and the shadows are quite different, their <strong>values</strong> are much more similar, they're both kind of dark.</p>

<h3>Lines vs. Reality</h3>

<p>We've learned a lot about lines, but I hate to break it to you, **lines aren't real! ** We don't see lines. As artists, we use lines as placeholders for the edges of shapes. Lines are a very useful tool for communicating ideas, but they are not what we actually see. They're an abstraction of what we see.</p>

<p>In reality, we see <strong>light as it affects forms</strong>. We see that light as an arrangement of <strong>colors</strong>. Shapes fill in with colors.</p>

<h3>The Components of Color</h3>

<p>Color is made up of <strong>hue</strong>, <strong>chroma</strong>, and <strong>value</strong>:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Hue</strong> is the family of colors it belongs to: yellow, red, blue, and so on.</li>

<li><strong>Chroma</strong> describes how pure or gray the color is. You can lower the chroma on a blue, and it's still blue but more gray, lower in chroma.</li>

<li><strong>Value</strong> describes how light or dark a color is, from white to black.</li>

</ul>

<p>We can make any color lighter or darker by adjusting its value.</p>

<h3>The Importance of Value</h3>

<p>The relationship between these three properties can get complicated, and that's beyond this course. The most important part of color is <strong>value</strong>. It's so important that artists often categorize it separately.</p>

<h2>Values in Drawing</h2>

<p>Let's imagine that a drawing is like a building. Each individual <strong>steel beam</strong> is like a <strong>line</strong>. Put those lines together to make shapes, and you get the steel framework of the building. <strong>Values are like the walls</strong>. They fill in the spaces between the framework, making it solid. Values create the <strong>illusion of form, depth, and volume</strong>. Beyond that, you have things like texture and color, which are like the decorations in the rooms, wallpaper, furniture. They're details that add to how your art feels.</p>

<p>All these elements are important. You take any one of them out, and you don't really have a building you would want to live in. But the walls, the floor, the roof, those are really important.</p>

<h3>Practicing with Values</h3>

<p>As a beginner, it's wise to practice drawing <strong>without color</strong>. Just practice using value to focus on light and form. Once you're comfortable with values, then you can introduce color to add more emotional impact. I know it's really tempting to jump to color, but if you want the time you spend practicing to have the biggest impact, <strong>start with values</strong>.</p>

<h2>The Value Scale</h2>

<p>Now that we understand what value is, let's talk about how we can organize it in a way that's practical for drawing. Imagine a scale from <strong>0 to 10</strong>, where <strong>0</strong> is the darkest black and <strong>10</strong> is the brightest white.</p>

<p>This can seem a bit counterintuitive if you think of value as pigment. When we draw, we start with white paper and add darker values with the pencil. But the system we'll be using in this course is the <strong>Munsell system</strong>. It's a traditional way of organizing color and value. Instead of measuring pigment, we're measuring <strong>light</strong>. When we're drawing, it's more practical to think about the subject we're drawing and how the light affects that subject. A value of <strong>10</strong> means that area is getting the most light, while a value of <strong>0</strong> means it's in complete shadow, and we can't see anything.</p>

<h3>Breaking Down the Value Scale</h3>

<p>In reality, the value scale is a smooth gradient with an <strong>infinite number of values</strong> between black and white. But trying to work with infinity is not very practical for drawing and organizing values. That's why artists typically break it down into <strong>steps of values</strong>, usually about <strong>10</strong>. This is more manageable and makes it easier to communicate. If I say "value number 3," you can imagine where that is on the scale.</p>

<p>Maybe you noticed that 0 to 10 is actually <strong>11 total values</strong> in the Munsell value scale. Some people adjust it to 10 and flip the order, but these numbers are just systems. The most important thing to understand is that there is a gradation from white to black, and you can split that into as many steps as you want.</p>

<h3>Using Limited Value Scales</h3>

<p>You don't always have to use all 10 values in every drawing. Sometimes, you might choose to work with a <strong>limited value scale</strong>. Maybe you decide to use <strong>5 values</strong>, just enough to represent the main elements of light and shadow.</p>

<p>You can also play around with different <strong>value ranges</strong> within the scale. Maybe your drawing only uses values from <strong>3 to 8</strong>, with no deep shadows or bright highlights. Or you could go for a moody drawing using only darker values from <strong>0 to 5</strong>. We'll learn more about value ranges in another lesson, and we'll practice with projects.</p>

<p>Our goal is to <strong>train your eye</strong> to see these subtle shifts in value and then translate them into something you can work with on paper.</p>

<h2>Determining Values</h2>

<p>There are <strong>four things</strong> that determine the values we see:</p>

<ol>

<li><strong>Light on form</strong></li>

<li><strong>Local value</strong></li>

<li><strong>Surface material</strong></li>

<li><strong>Atmosphere</strong></li>

</ol>

<p>For beginners, I highly recommend focusing mostly on those <strong>first two</strong>: <strong>light on form</strong> and <strong>local value</strong>. The second two are a little bit more advanced, and you should come back to them later.</p>

<h3>Light on Form and Local Value</h3>

<p><strong>Local value</strong> is the <strong>inherent lightness or darkness</strong> of the thing, regardless of the light you shine on it. The value of my hair is darker than the value of my skin, that's local value. The local value of something is not always consistent. An apple can have a lot of variety in its local value, and a general gradation from light to dark.</p>

<p>Even though my hair is darker than my skin, the value of the <strong>shadow on my skin</strong> is darker than the <strong>highlights on my hair</strong>, that's <strong>light on form</strong>.</p>

<p>When you shine a light on something, it makes it brighter, the value goes up because there's more light. But the value doesn't go up evenly on the entire object. It gets distributed based on the form and where the planes are facing. The part of the object that faces towards the light gets affected the most. As these planes start to turn away, they get affected by the light less, and so they get darker.</p>

<h3>Combining Light on Form and Local Value</h3>

<p>Local value and light on form act together. Both of these apples are hit by the same light, but the light side of the red apple is darker than the yellow apple. The same goes for the shadow sides.</p>

<p>I hope you're starting to see the <strong>value of values</strong>! There is a lot more to learn, but first, I'll give you a simple warm-up exercise and project in the next two videos to get your hands dirty. See you in the next one.</p>
