<h2>Understanding Facial Construction</h2>

<p>When drawing facial features, it's crucial to understand the underlying structure and how different elements interact. We begin by considering the <strong>placement of facial features</strong>, particularly the nose. The tip of the nose is often positioned higher than expected, possibly even further up than one might initially think.</p>

<p><strong>Proportions of facial features</strong> remain consistent, but they build off the face structure. This means that while the relative sizes of features stay the same, their exact placement depends on the overall shape and angle of the face.</p>

<p>Understanding <strong>plane changes</strong> is essential for accurately representing light and shadow. We need to be aware of how different surfaces of the face interact with light, creating areas of highlight, mid-tone, and shadow.</p>

<p><strong>Form intersection</strong> between features is another critical aspect. We must pay attention to how different parts of the face connect and overlap. This helps create a sense of depth and dimensionality in our drawings.</p>

<p><strong>Consistency in perspective</strong> is crucial when drawing facial features. While perspective isn't always necessary (notan and other styles are valid), we're aiming for a secured sense of perspective here. Wobbling or warping in the drawing can occur when there isn't a comparable intersection agreement between forms.</p>

<p><strong>Surface choreography</strong> in drawing translates to value considerations in rendering. The way we construct and connect different planes of the face will directly impact how we apply light and shadow later on.</p>

<h2>Eye Construction</h2>

<h3>Three-Quarter Top View</h3>

<p>When constructing eyes in a three-quarter top view, we use a technique called <strong>one cut, parallel lines</strong>. This involves making a single cut to define the eye socket, then adding parallel lines to further describe its shape.</p>

<p>We also employ a <strong>three-plane approach</strong> for eye sockets. This method helps us understand and represent the complex curvature of the eye area by breaking it down into three main planes.</p>

<h3>Under View</h3>

<p>For the under view of the eyes, we again use the <strong>three-plane approach</strong> for eye sockets. However, the planes are oriented differently to account for the change in perspective.</p>

<p>We also introduce a <strong>flaring technique</strong> for the eye socket cutback in three-quarter view. This technique helps create a more natural and dynamic shape for the eye socket.</p>

<h3>General Techniques</h3>

<p>A useful technique for representing the eye socket is the <strong>spiral method</strong>. This involves drawing a spiral shape to capture the curved nature of the socket.</p>

<p>To create depth in the eye area, we can add a <strong>small plane underneath the eyelids</strong>. This subtle detail can significantly enhance the realism of our eye drawings.</p>

<h2>Nose Construction</h2>

<h3>Three-Quarter Top View</h3>

<p>In a downward-facing pose, we use a <strong>keystone construction</strong> for the nose. This involves identifying the keystone of the nose and connecting it to the tip, creating the top plane of the nose.</p>

<p>It's important to note that in this view, the <strong>nose tip is placed below the base</strong>. This can be counterintuitive but is crucial for accurate representation.</p>

<h3>Under View</h3>

<p>When constructing the nose from an under view, we focus on three main elements: the <strong>base, width, and tip placement</strong>. We begin by establishing the base of the nose, then determine its width, and finally place the tip.</p>

<h3>General Techniques</h3>

<p>Regardless of the view, we always need to <strong>connect the nose to the face</strong>. This involves securing the nose on the front of the face, being careful to avoid creating a triangular shape by tapering the nose upwards.</p>

<p>We should also consider <strong>cartilage and base width variations</strong>. Nose cartilage and base width can vary, allowing for diverse nose shapes.</p>

<p>In profiles, noses are often represented using <strong>overlapping triangles</strong>. Even slight elliptical decisions can suggest the side, bottom, and front/top of the nose.</p>

<h2>Mouth and Teeth Construction</h2>

<p>For the mouth and teeth, we use the <strong>denture sphere concept</strong>. This involves imagining a sphere that represents the overall shape of the mouth area.</p>

<p>We may need to <strong>adjust the center line</strong> for teeth and the denture sphere to ensure proper alignment.</p>

<p><strong>Lip proportions</strong> should follow the roundness of the denture sphere. This helps create a natural and harmonious relationship between the lips and the overall mouth structure.</p>

<h2>Chin Construction</h2>

<p>We construct the chin using a <strong>horizontal egg shape</strong> technique. This simple shape can be modified as needed to capture different chin types.</p>

<p>It's worth noting the <strong>differences between male and female chins</strong>. Men's chins often feature a divot and a stair-step profile, while women's are typically smoother.</p>

<h2>Cheek and Temple Representation</h2>

<p>Cheeks and temples are represented using <strong>side planes and discs</strong>. This approach helps capture the subtle contours of these areas.</p>

<p>The <strong>T-zone of the cheek</strong> is an important structural element to consider. This refers to the area where the cheek meets the nose and eye area.</p>

<p>We should also be aware of the <strong>relationship between cheekbone height and aesthetics</strong>. The height and prominence of the cheekbones can significantly impact the overall look of the face.</p>

<h2>Advanced Concepts</h2>

<p>As we become more comfortable with basic facial construction, we can explore more advanced techniques:</p>

<ul>

<li>The <strong>mirroring technique</strong> for symmetrical forms can be useful for ensuring balance in our drawings.</li>

<li>We can start <strong>combining techniques from different schools of thought</strong> to develop our own unique approach.</li>

<li>There's always potential for <strong>further exploration of anatomy, muscles, and stylization</strong> to enhance our facial drawings.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Head Construction Process</h2>

<p>When constructing a head, we typically follow a series of steps:</p>

<ol>

<li><strong>Establish proportions and key landmarks</strong></li>

<li>Determine the <strong>ear position relative to other facial features</strong></li>

<li>Use <strong>triangular shapes</strong> to depict various facial structures</li>

<li>Employ <strong>ball shapes as placeholders</strong> for more detailed observations of lighting and form</li>

</ol>

<p>Remember, these techniques are flexible and can be adapted to suit different styles and preferences. The key is to understand the underlying principles and apply them in a way that works for your artistic vision.</p>
