<p><strong>Brush Selection and Technique</strong></p>

<p>When starting a portrait, I focus on selecting a brush that suits the area I'm working on. This is crucial for painting from the inside out, a method that emphasizes precision and early problem correction. For drawing shadows, I switch to a more precise brush, like an older number two, which offers better accuracy than a charcoal stick. This approach allows me to simplify the image by squinting and focusing on the darks, ensuring that both eyes are in unison as I work on them simultaneously.</p>

<p><strong>Color Mixing and Harmony</strong></p>

<p>The subject's exceptionally blue eyes are a focal point, so I mix white and black to create a strong blue. I might add cobalt blue later for vibrancy, but initially, I avoid it to maintain harmony in the skin tones. Instead, I use basic colors like ketchup and mustard for the skin, resisting the temptation to make everything overly bright. This helps in maintaining a balanced and harmonious color palette throughout the painting.</p>

<p><strong>Value and Tone Management</strong></p>

<p>Managing values and tones is essential to avoid overly bright areas. I opt for average tones and adjust the average skin color to create the white of the eye value, cleaning up any charcoal tones. Establishing key values and areas early on guides the rest of the painting, ensuring consistency and avoiding overpainting. This method helps in capturing the subtle contrasts in values, which are challenging but rewarding.</p>

<p><strong>Observation and Decision-Making</strong></p>

<p>Observation plays a critical role in my decision-making process, especially when dealing with subtle shadows on fair skin. I focus on capturing these subtle contrasts, using pre-mixed values to maintain consistency. This approach allows me to make informed decisions based on what I observe, rather than relying on formulaic methods.</p>

<p><strong>Capturing Subtle Contrasts</strong></p>

<p>Working on both eyes simultaneously ensures they are in unison, and squinting helps simplify the image to focus on the darks. Capturing the subtle grays in the skin adds realism to the portrait. This attention to detail is crucial for achieving a lifelike representation.</p>

<p><strong>Adding Warmth and Highlights</strong></p>

<p>To add warmth, I apply a bit of blush to the cheeks, avoiding formulaic approaches. I ensure the nose doesn't appear too red, as it can imply a cold or other conditions. Using halftones and average lights, I draw shapes around the lips, avoiding over-modeling. Highlights are added to the lips to define their shape and value, enhancing the overall realism of the portrait.</p>

<p><strong>Emphasizing Precision and Boldness</strong></p>

<p>Using a brush for precision is sometimes more effective than charcoal, allowing for bold brushwork and precise drawing. Painting from the inside out reflects my current style, which emphasizes both precision and boldness. This method not only helps in catching and correcting problems early but also allows for a more dynamic and expressive painting process.</p>
