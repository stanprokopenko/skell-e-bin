<p>One of my personal favorite projects was creating the cover for <strong>Iron Fist 4</strong>. This piece came together well, and it's an idea I had been mulling over for a long time. Ever since they established the lineage of Iron Fist, that it wasn't just one character, Danny Rand, but a heritage of warriors, I wanted to create an illustration showcasing that lineage.</p>

<h2>The Concept of the Iron Fist Lineage</h2>

<p>I envisioned an illustration that displayed the various Iron Fists throughout history, respecting and highlighting that heritage. When they introduced a new Iron Fist in the most recent series, with Danny taking on a mentor role, it was the perfect opportunity to bring this idea to life.</p>

<p>I wanted to take the <strong>Iron Fist logo</strong> and design and thread it through the different Iron Fists, moving from the new character, back to Danny, and further back through time. This would visually represent him threading his way through the timeline, making the new Iron Fist the star while showing that he is who he is because of those who came before him. Literally and figuratively, they are in his background.</p>

<h2>Pitching the Idea to Marvel</h2>

<p>As a comic fan and artist, I follow industry news closely. When I read about the new Iron Fist series, I got excited and wanted to contribute my love for the character. I reached out to my editors at Marvel, expressing my interest in doing a cover. They were receptive and asked me to send sketches.</p>

<p>I offered to create an illustration focusing on the lineage and history of Iron Fist, essentially an Iron Fist family tree tied together by the Iron Fist energy. They loved the idea, and requested sketches. I worked up three or four different sketches, featuring my favorite iterations of Iron Fist.</p>

<p>I usually send my sketches numbered by preference. This concept was my top choice, and fortunately, it was theirs too. After getting approval from higher-ups, I was eager to start, even though I had another project to finish first. I felt like a schoolboy, grinning and excited to begin.</p>

<h2>Creating the Artwork</h2>

<h3>Using Models and Reference</h3>

<p>For the new Iron Fist, I used one of my students as the model. He was perfect and did an outstanding job. I modeled for three of the other Iron Fists myself and found reference material for the remaining two. I relied on reference, especially for the folds in the outfits, as it's challenging to invent convincing folds from imagination.</p>

<h3>Exploring Costume Designs</h3>

<p>It was fun exploring the various costume designs. Each Iron Fist had the same general elements in their costumes, but with unique twists. There was the World War I militant version, the Southeast Asian-inspired version, the traditional kung fu style, and the modern design with shoulder pads, buckles, straps, and belts, common in contemporary superhero designs.</p>

<h3>Color Choices</h3>

<p>I wanted to show the contrast of warms and cools in the piece. I used a warmer green for the costumes, cooler than the yellows and oranges in the background. The <strong>Iron Fist energy</strong> is represented with glowing yellow-orange power, contrasting with the green.</p>

<p>For some reason, I've always liked orange and green together. Even though they're not technically complementary colors, they have an interesting harmony that I enjoy. It creates a neat resonance that I find appealing.</p>

<h2>Personal Reflections</h2>

<h3>Excitement About the Project</h3>

<p>As I worked on the piece, I sent progress shots to my editors and a few Iron Fist fans I know. Their excitement fueled me even more. Sometimes, there's a project that you've thought about for years, and finally getting to work on it is incredibly energizing.</p>

<p>Someone once doubted that artists spend years mastering their craft just to make a picture. The truth is, we spend <strong>20, 30, 40 years mastering our craft so that we can paint something like Iron Fist</strong>. The whole reason I started doing this was because of comics.</p>

<p>This idea had been rolling around in my head for at least 20 years. Finally, after years of working towards that goal, I got to paint it. It was a lot of fun, and I'm honored to have brought some of my love for the character to others.</p>

<h3>Connection to the Legacy of Iron Fist</h3>

<p>I tried to bring a <strong>Hong Kong Bruce Lee movie poster feel</strong> to the piece, incorporating a montage element without homaging any specific poster. Warm colors are often used in those posters, and it was enjoyable to stretch that montage muscle. At the time, I hadn't done much of it, having focused more on literal scenes.</p>

<p>This piece launched my aesthetic in a new direction, going more towards design-heavy elements and not being so literal. Many of my art heroes from the Silver Age of illustration did very literal scenes, illustrating stories by showing exactly what was happening. Recently, I've been looking at artists like James Bama and Drew Struzan, who incorporated more montage and design elements, and started incorporating that into my work.</p>

<p>I wanted to convey that <strong>Iron Fist isn't just a character, but an ideal</strong>. Each of these characters contributed to that ideal, building towards it or trying to embody it. It's what's now known as a legacy hero, it's not about any one character but about an ideal you're striving for.</p>

<p>I can relate to that because it's something that drives me as an artist as well. This legacy of illustration is something I greatly admire, and I'm trying to contribute to it myself. Maybe, to some small degree, I can be that to the next generation, hoping that it never dies out.</p>

<h3>Artistic Influences</h3>

<p>These generations of heroes did what they did to honor what came before them, and inspire what comes after. I wanted that to come across in the image. These are the things going through my head when I'm creating, trying to dig for something deeper than just a cool picture.</p>

<p>I aim to bring out my own perception, identity, and relationship to the stories that excite me, not just when I was young, but even now. I try to share that excitement with others. It's never just a drawing or a painting. If it were, I'd like all the cool stuff, but some things strike me harder than others. I try to understand why that is, and share that with people.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p>Working on the cover for <strong>Iron Fist 4</strong> was a profound and fulfilling experience. It allowed me to realize a long-held vision and contribute to the legacy of a character I deeply admire. Through this piece, I wanted to honor the lineage of Iron Fist and explore themes of heritage, idealism, and the passing of the torch.</p>

<p>Creating this artwork reaffirmed my passion for illustration and storytelling. It's projects like these that remind me why I began this journey, to share my love for these characters and ideals with others and perhaps inspire the next generation to do the same.</p>
