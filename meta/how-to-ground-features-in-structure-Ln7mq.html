<h2>Developing and Modifying Planes</h2>

<p>To create realistic and structured drawings, start by <strong>developing the big ideas and features for planes</strong>. Investigate how to modify these planes by <strong>adding or subtracting form</strong>. Think of wrapping and molding an egg around the structure to get a sense of the overall shape. Customize your drawing with smaller form modifications to add detail and nuance.</p>

<h2>Proportions and Placement of Features</h2>

<p><strong>Double-check proportions</strong>, not just the tilt or setup of your drawing. Reproportioning can significantly improve features like the nose and eyes. Review the <strong>halves and thirds</strong> of the face for better placement of features. Sometimes, you may need to <strong>pull features apart</strong> to give them more breathing room.</p>

<h2>Perspective and Consistency</h2>

<p>Ensure <strong>consistency in perspective lines</strong>. Avoid bending the head subtly, as this can distort your drawing. Keep the <strong>centerline straight</strong> to match the tilt. Consistency in wrapping lines is crucial for maintaining perspective. Make sure to <strong>match wrapping lines for each feature</strong>.</p>

<h2>Light, Shadow, and Tone</h2>

<p>Avoid overkill by using <strong>light, shadow, or painting</strong> to add depth. Move to tone after a thorough investigation with line. Add <strong>shading on top of your lines</strong> and notice how cast shadows drop across different planes and their changes.</p>

<h2>Drawing Specific Features</h2>

<ul>

<li><strong>Nostrils</strong>: They have a bottom plane, tuck up, and have dimension.</li>

<li><strong>Eyes</strong>: They need a place to live, housed inside the socket. Develop secondary structures like the eyelid.</li>

<li><strong>Nose</strong>: The wing of the nose or nostril helps space features. Think about the keystone and sculpt into it.</li>

<li><strong>Lips</strong>: Ensure they match the overall perspective. Avoid curving back the bottom part of the face.</li>

<li><strong>Chin and Jaw</strong>: Apply the same adjustments to these areas as you do to the rest of the face.</li>

<li><strong>Front Plane</strong>: Consider this when moving to the side. Sidelines should reference the front plane.</li>

<li><strong>Ears</strong>: Ensure they feel grafted to the surface.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Common Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them</h2>

<p>Address common stumbling blocks in portrait drawing by ensuring setup information is consistent for well-drawn features. Soften areas and focus on the profile for better readability. <strong>Push overlaps</strong> to avoid flat and graphic appearances. Manage forms to avoid flattening out and push some areas for clearer overlaps. </p>

<p>Ground features in head construction and maintain perspective. <strong>Triple-check big fundamentals</strong> like leaning down and forward. Drop the nose if needed to maintain perspective. Each line is an opportunity to rethink edge. Focus on the plane of the brow and double-check how lines relate to each other. Ensure all features reference the same perspective line.</p>

<p>Consider how the eye overlaps and wraps. Eyes looking up should meet on a plane indicative of the bottom socket area. The eye can move independently of the structure, but ensure it still references the overall structure. Adjust lines to maintain structural agreement. Lips should align unless there's an expression changing direction. The bottom portion of the face should maintain plane consistency.</p>

<h2>Next Steps</h2>

<p>Add light and shadow to develop planes. Understand how line relates to tone and structure. Develop both skills hand in hand. Continue studying and refining your work to achieve mastery in portrait drawing.</p>
