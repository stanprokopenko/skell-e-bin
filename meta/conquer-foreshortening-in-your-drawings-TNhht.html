<h2>Pushing the Extreme in Foreshortening</h2>

<p>In some of these examples, I want to push more into the extreme use of foreshortened aspects of the lines and their dynamics. For instance, take a head that looks pretty close to what we've been discussing as the norm. It might look similar to one we've done before, except here I'm really seeing the rib cage shift away and the pelvis shift back. So now we have more in-and-out movement.</p>

<p>In this case, I focus on shortening these lines to the degree that I want them to recede more quickly. Then, I follow that up by emphasizing the wrap, and then the pelvis opposite, the wrap is opposite but the principle is the same in terms of making the line shorter.</p>

<h2>Shortening Lines and Emphasizing Wraps</h2>

<p>For the arm, the length might be just that long due to foreshortening. In terms of following through with gesture and getting that perspective, I look at the lower arm, it might only be that long. When these start to feel a bit more challenging, or you're getting into the weeds of difficult aspects of posing, keep in mind the goal.</p>

<p>There's a reason you're working to do this, because you want to put a character in a really cool position with an elbow coming directly at the camera. This is challenging to learn right now, but the reward of having learned it is that you'll be capable of showing so much more range. Not just the figure feeling rhythmic top-down, but also moving toward and away from the camera.</p>

<h2>Maintaining Rhythm in Complex Poses</h2>

<p>The rhythm, the animated, active, fun, lyrical movement, hasn't left. It's just gotten more complex. I'm trying to work slowly, and I'm shortening these lines, but at no point is my rhythm going away. I haven't lost that, it's still very much foregrounded, for all the reasons that we started.</p>

<p>That's something to always keep in mind, little reminders. I do it all the time. Then, instead of just being parallel, a form comes closer. So now we're starting to move the figure toward the camera or the leg, and then another part goes back.</p>

<h2>Using Foreshortening to Create Depth</h2>

<p>The same principle applies, get that same length, match the femur above, but then start to push that. So it's a little bit different from one pose to the challenge I've included below. Similar, but with more space and more foreshortening. Here, the challenge was just how to fold the gesture.</p>

<p>This is probably one of the most common questions: "How do I do it when it's straight on?" Well, there are lots of options.</p>

<h2>Options for Straight-On Poses</h2>

<p>Your options could be:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Draw it as is.</strong></li>

<li>**Push asymmetry in the back and forth - the 3D asymmetry. **</li>

<li><strong>Change it.</strong> What's wrong with changing it? Why not turn it a bit or try to create some movement if you feel like it's there?</li>

</ul>

<p>That might be something we try to do here. I realize that it's straight up and down. If I'm absolutely committed to that structuring, I would still say that there's some pinch and stretch, but maybe the spine's directly in the middle.</p>

<h2>Asymmetry in Space</h2>

<p>Then, I would try to show the forward-backward projection of form, that the rib cage goes away in space and the pelvis comes toward you in space. That's asymmetry, but in space, and that's good because our body wouldn't stay upright if there wasn't an asymmetrical perspective balance.</p>

<p>If we were designed so that our rib cage just came forward and our pelvis kept coming forward, that'd be weird, right? We would've landed on our backs long ago and maybe evolved differently. So, there is the same asymmetrical balance of space.</p>

<h2>Experimenting with Shoulder Tilts</h2>

<p>Maybe you play with an asymmetry of tilts in the shoulders. The shoulders have their own unique expressive quality. Maybe on your gestures, you could include a tilt line like that for shoulders. Try experimenting with that. I think it's really fun.</p>

<p>Here's the stretch, here's your lumbar, here's that pelvis. I kind of got at the same problem over there, but the only difference is my intention is never to close off shapes when I'm doing this.</p>

<h2>Focusing on Internal Lines</h2>

<p>You might ask, "Aren't you just drawing the outsides?" No, not intentionally. All of my lines are always intended to be somewhat on the inside because I anticipate building to the contour.</p>

<p>When I was learning this as a student, my challenge to myself was you can't draw the contour if you don't know what it is. The outside isn't just the shape, it's an extension of everything you know on the inside.</p>

<p>So, whenever I'm doing these lines, I'm anticipating my build to end somewhere out there. I can slowly approach it because it's hard, and sometimes I need that forgiving aspect to a drawing. Not everybody does, but I definitely do.</p>

<h2>Using Wraps and Pelvis Orientation</h2>

<p>Here's some wraps for that, and then we can say our pelvis. I always like to exaggerate this. I'm always skeptical of people that tilt the pelvis from this angle, too far forward. That's asking a lot of your lumbar spine to change direction, instead of the spine going like this, if you tilt your pelvis forward, you're saying the lumbar spine is going that way, which is uncomfortable.</p>

<p>Now, I don't see legs, right? So I get a little bit of a leg. What would that be? Maybe a gesture line like that, and then I wrap. I'm not foreshortening by stacking shape, I've just given you a hint of a gesture and then pushed a wrapping line.</p>

<h2>Relying on Ellipses and Wraps</h2>

<p>On this side, I get my lower leg, so that's coming back here. Here's my foot shape, but let's try to find that asymmetry of the foot, and then another one here. And then on the arms, scapula shape, shoulder, same principle.</p>

<p>When a limb is foreshortened, there's no more foreshortening than that leg there, it's that long. Where normally our arm would be that long. That would be the basic proportional relationship, elbow equals bottom of rib cage.</p>

<p>So here, this goes forward. Use your rubber bands. And then that goes up, a cool move behind the hair or head. And then on this side, maybe we can find some nice design elements.</p>

<h2>Thinking About Design Elements</h2>

<p>Let's start to think about design more. Let's take the back of that thoracic and just bring it up. That looks kind of nice, it goes slightly away, and maybe this comes across and over.</p>

<p>All the while, think about, "Oh cool, I learned in short how to pose out this really cool position. I think I have an idea for a character that I want to put in a position like that," or something so that it's never just an isolated exercise in a vacuum.</p>

<p>Gesture is notational so that you have all this information to give to things that you would like to draw.</p>

<h2>Dealing with Reclining Poses</h2>

<p>Let's try this one. It's not closed in as a pose, but it exhibits some of the same aspects of difficulty the other ones did. Here's my head.</p>

<p>In reclining poses, I see strange things happening. The idea of foreshortening, the solve for it, as I've been saying, is that you make the line shorter. But what I mostly see people do is make things longer, the opposite. I tend to see people, instead of bringing it in a little bit, doing this, this, this, and it gets progressively longer in the body parts.</p>

<p>I'm not sure why, but I can relate to it because I have done it myself. So, it's just something to be aware of, that really, you're looking to do the opposite of that.</p>

<h2>Applying Foreshortening in Reclining Poses</h2>

<p>So here's my lumbar and my pelvis. The thing that I am without in this is that continued expectation for having a goal in the bottom being the weight-bearing leg.</p>

<p>What becomes difficult here is weight-bearing pelvis or weight-bearing seat. But think of it as just like a structure. I have a mass that's here, and it's kind of leaning that way, and then without something to support it out here, it's going to fall over.</p>

<p>Sometimes that's a fun way to think about how your poses are maintained, how weight works.</p>

<h2>Using Ellipses for Forward and Back in Space</h2>

<p>So there's the ground here, and then we have, oh, so this is going to be challenging. But you know, sometimes you have that thought when you're drawing, like, "Oh no, the leg's coming right out at me." That's all right, we know how to handle that.</p>

<p>Just shorten the line, push the wraps, and you could use your knee there as a template for what you want. Then this leg goes back, same thing, just shorten that line and then push your wraps back.</p>

<p>What might be helpful is to start to get comfortable drawing ellipses. All the foundation exercises and the foundation drawing course would be probably awesome for that, or just practicing ellipses and getting comfortable doing them.</p>

<h2>Practicing Ellipses and Planes</h2>

<p>Sometimes, ellipse exercises, you could try gradually opening them, or if you really struggle with ellipses, you could try starting with a plane and then angling your plane and building ellipses in.</p>

<p>I'm relying quite a bit on that technical aspect of the drawing to get the forward and back in space. So here would be this leg, and that comes out a bit, and that, but that knee lines up more or less with the bottom of this knee.</p>

<p>So here's me using a relational measurement to try to make an understanding of that, and then the lower leg just kind of does what we would expect.</p>

<h2>Using Line Weight and Composition</h2>

<p>This arm, which I said was important for getting that weight, so maybe I build the rhythm off that stretch into the shoulder. And now, let's try to incorporate more line weight.</p>

<p>We could tell the viewer about the importance of this leg, and we could push some darker lines. Start to treat these now, as you get more comfortable, start to treat them as compositions.</p>

<p>Line weight could be a way to direct the eye somewhere. And if they become more compositions or exercises in compositions, then you're really starting to think of them as plans for what you might develop.</p>

<h2>Emphasizing Important Areas with Line Weight</h2>

<p>So up and then back. All this gets stretched, and then maybe we darken this line. So that gives my viewer the understanding that what's important here, just based on where I've exercised some artistic energy, is here and here.</p>

<p>Then this pose is suspended in terms of weight between those two, so maybe that's done.</p>

<h2>Handling Crouched or Foreshortened Poses</h2>

<p>Let's try this one. For these hard kind of crouched or foreshortened poses, difficulties in this one could be:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>The overlapping of the arms in front of the body.</strong></li>

<li><strong>The positioning and perspective of the legs.</strong></li>

<li><strong>The way that the weight is dispersed through the seat and then into the hips and legs.</strong></li>

</ul>

<p>It's always head to kind of primary area of weight.</p>

<h2>Building Rhythm and Direction</h2>

<p>This leg goes back, or does it? Maybe slightly forward. So thinking of the wraps, this comes forward, so a little bit shorter in line. Here's the wrap on that, and then back, there's my foot.</p>

<p>Same thing in terms of line weight. Maybe now we bring a little bit more attention here just to pop these out in space. I don't feel like it's necessary to come in and resolve shape, but I like how this comes up and cradles the bottom of the head.</p>

<p>That hand has a great S-curve to it. It tracks on the roll or the tilt of that head. My shoulder on this side drops, this comes slightly forward and up.</p>

<h2>Embracing Challenges in Posing</h2>

<p>But in this, maybe in more of a design sense, I'm thinking about joining rhythm. How does this arm flow into this arm, flow into that head, kind of create continued interest in the portrait.</p>

<p>What would I do here? I'd probably just give up. Sometimes you have that thought when you're drawing, like, "Oh no, this is tough." But here's the same principle of that forward balance that we spent a little time discussing, forward balance, forward projection of the body into that lean.</p>

<p>We've dealt with this from the side and a little bit on the crouching in that top row, but here I want to show it in space. So we're in that extreme foreshortening.</p>

<h2>Solving Forward Lean with Foreshortening</h2>

<p>So the S-curve. Then we do the thoracic lumbar, shorten the lines. Here's my pelvis. I think you already have a good idea how to approach this, you're just moving it toward us.</p>

<p>And then a femur, lower leg, up on the foot. There's my head. Now, where's that back leg? Back leg is here, and then let's push it this way.</p>

<p>Maybe I could start to push some of that invention.</p>

<h2>Incorporating Invention in Poses</h2>

<p>Invention just being, it doesn't have to originate as a brand new idea from your head, but maybe you can invent a different position based on a couple parts.</p>

<p>The history of painting is largely painters going to the museum, looking at existing compositions, and then riffing off of those figures and compositions. Those painters throughout history weren't accused of plagiarism, they were taking and playing with conventions.</p>

<p>So maybe something like that kind of broadens our pose out a little bit. Maybe I'm exploring something that might feel a little bit more stable.</p>

<h2>Thinking About Weight and Balance</h2>

<p>Maybe I'm trying to do the opposite, where this feels like it has less stability. And then let's include that arm, so shoulder.</p>

<p>I think what I like here is maybe I'll just create a longer S-curve so it feels like it builds into that nice design of the leg coming forward. I like the shared sense of rhythm and direction.</p>

<p>I don't like the quality of overlap, so maybe I'll move that a little bit forward. You have to push the head out some, and then I like how this comes back. I like that this arm is doing the same thing as this arm, but up.</p>

<p>I think that makes a fun directional line up and down through the kind of the more static area of the torso there.</p>

<h2>Combining Gestures and Designs</h2>

<p>You could try to, if you want, wrap that up just by pushing your space. But when the drawing is notationally done for you, it's done.</p>

<p>There's no gesture police or anybody that's going to come say, "You need to do a little bit more here, you really blew it on that shoulder," or "It doesn't look like the pose."</p>

<p>When you feel like it's good, it's good. I solved my forward lean, I have a sense of how I would build this forward.</p>

<h2>Approaching Symmetrical and Straight-On Views</h2>

<p>For these two, I think their challenge exists in the fact that they're more symmetrical. And it's surprising, right? You would think that the more dynamic poses are the harder ones. People never really struggle with those, in my experience, it's always the subtle ones.</p>

<p>So, how would I deal with this? Now, let's be more generous with the interpretation because on the last one we did kind of box it out to be very severe.</p>

<p>Maybe I'll do my side-to-side pinch. I see there's a shifting of weight. So here's my spine rhythms, my setup, same thing though. If you feel like there's not enough turn, or if it's symmetrical, then really push this. Push that this comes forward.</p>

<h2>Understanding Gesture as a Starting Point</h2>

<p>It's not the best, but it's good enough to get you moving and onto the next step. I think people get stuck with this front and back idea because they start to adopt the thought that the gesture is the end of the drawing.</p>

<p>It's just notational, right? It's just for you to get started, to develop. So if this were the end of the drawing, that would be weird, one. But two, that's too much pressure.</p>

<p>There's a whole list of steps that would come after this where I would take this from my loose lay-in to a finished drawing.</p>

<h2>Applying Foreshortening and Wraps Once More</h2>

<p>So, it's just what you need to understand that position. And so that goes back, shorter line, push the wrap.</p>

<p>You can compare it to this one where each arm would be of equal length, back and behind.</p>

<p>Then, foreshortening for the legs, so maybe shorter. And then on this side, it kind of comes back in this way, and we can push our wraps this way, and then maybe get a little bit back here.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p>I hope this discussion and draw-through of our basic poses helps give you a sense of how to take what we know or what we started out with and aim it at some poses that aren't exactly friendly, from the standpoint of their space or foreshortening.</p>

<p>I tried to systematically go through issues in each, whether it's the seated pose, the forward bend, and then introduce slightly more complicated issues of perspective push forward or back in terms of limbs and space, and then end with these.</p>

<p>I'll probably always end again with symmetry, back and front, just so that we make people comfortable with that as a view.</p>
