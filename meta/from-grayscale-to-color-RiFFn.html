<h2>Laying the Groundwork</h2>

<p>I started off in <strong>black and white</strong> to establish clear values before introducing color. I used <strong>flats</strong> to block in the basic shapes and then pushed the volume using a combination of <strong>Multiply</strong> layers, <strong>Screen</strong> layers, and normal painting. With these values in place, I’m ready to add color on top.</p>

<h2>First Pass with Color Mode</h2>

<p>I like to use <strong>Color</strong> layer mode as a first pass. I create a new layer, set it to Color, pick a general skin tone and fill the figure. This is just a base, nothing is final. I can adjust the color at any time using a hue and saturation slider, for example, pressing Control + U. The goal here is to find a starting point,</p>

<p>• I might also isolate areas, like the eyes or teeth, on their own Color layers to refine them. For instance, I’ll pick a lighter, desaturated color for the eyes and dial back the saturation if it feels too intense.</p>

<h2>Adding Variation and Depth</h2>

<h3>Subtle Color Shifts</h3>

<p>Once I have a flat color base, I create more layers to introduce color variation in places like ears, cheeks, or anywhere that needs a different tone. Sometimes I stick to <strong>Color</strong> mode, but I also love <strong>Multiply</strong> for shading. Multiply will darken color while preserving the values underneath. This is where I often use an <strong>airbrush</strong> for subtle transitions, especially around the ears or under the eyes:</p>

<p>• I adjust layer opacity to control how strong the color looks.<br />

• If it becomes too saturated or bright, I can lower the opacity to dial it back.</p>

<h3>Iteration and Layer Management</h3>

<p>I often duplicate my entire group of layers, merge them, and keep an “archive” version of my progress. That way I can push forward without fear of losing earlier stages. Most of the time, though, I don’t revert to them, I just like the option.</p>

<h2>Refining Forms and Cleaning Shapes</h2>

<p>At this point, I go back with my normal painting tools (or sometimes the <strong>Filthy</strong> plugin with its delete option) and tidy edges. I’ll often rotate the canvas to match my natural arm movement when I need to make clean lines with the <strong>Lasso</strong> tool. Flipping the canvas upside down helps me see abstract shapes, which keeps me from getting stuck in the idea that I’m drawing a face or a nose. I can look for inconsistencies in shapes more easily this way.</p>

<h3>Layer Modes for Highlights and Shadows</h3>

<p>I use <strong>Screen</strong> mode for lighter areas and <strong>Multiply</strong> for darker tones. Both modes let me experiment by choosing different colors for my shadows and lights:</p>

<p>• <strong>Multiply:</strong> Darkens colors, great for shadows.<br />

• <strong>Screen:</strong> Lightens colors, perfect for highlights.  </p>

<p>I also erase if shadows go too dark or if parts of the highlights feel blown out. And since I’m on separate layers, I can always reduce opacity to back off on intensity.</p>

<h2>Building Texture and Details</h2>

<h3>Hair and Stubble</h3>

<p>To suggest stubble, I pick slightly different colors and use Multiply or Color mode to tint the skin in smaller patches. Then, I erase or paint back in a bit at the edges to hint at individual hairs. If it looks too stuck on, I soften or tweak the edges until it blends more naturally.</p>

<h3>Teeth and Mouth</h3>

<p>I make the inside of the mouth darker with Multiply layers, which helps push it back in space. Front teeth get more light, back teeth get less. I like to keep them from looking too bright or flat. If I need extra color punch, I’ll cut a shape onto a new layer, switch to Multiply, and increase saturation for that area. If it gets too intense, I knock it back.</p>

<h2>Subsurface Glows and Special Effects</h2>

<p>I sometimes mimic <strong>subsurface scattering</strong> by using <strong>Color Dodge</strong> or <strong>Screen</strong> around thin parts of the skin, like ears or fingertips. On a new layer, I choose a color close to the skin tone, then gently brush where light could pass through flesh. After that, I lower the layer’s opacity until it feels natural.</p>

<h2>Additional Rim Light</h2>

<p>To finish, I like adding a contrasting <strong>rim light</strong>. If my main tones are warm, I’ll choose a <strong>cool</strong> color (like blue) for the rim. I set a layer to Screen and paint a thin highlight on one edge. I might add another thin, almost white accent on the very edge in areas that would be overexposed by a bright light source.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p>From laying down the initial black and white values to layering color, it’s a lot of <strong>iteration</strong>, testing a color, adjusting it, merging layers, refining shapes, and repeating. I can keep going, refining details and shapes, but this workflow already gives me a <strong>solid, dimensional</strong> result. It’s all about experimenting and exploring different layer modes until I’m happy with the look.</p>
