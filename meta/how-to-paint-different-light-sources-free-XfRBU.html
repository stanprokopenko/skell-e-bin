<h2>What's in Premium?</h2>

<p>In this premium lesson, you'll learn how different <strong>light sources</strong> influence the mood and realism of your paintings. We'll cover the characteristics of <strong>point light sources</strong> like light bulbs, where light intensity decreases with distance due to <strong>light falloff</strong>. You'll understand how <strong>distant light sources</strong> like the sun provide consistent lighting with parallel rays and negligible falloff.</p>

<p>We'll explore the differences between <strong>hard light</strong> and <strong>soft light</strong>, examining how direct sunlight creates sharp-edged shadows, while <strong>scattered light</strong> from clouds softens shadows and transitions. The lesson explains the role of <strong>occlusion shadows</strong>, those soft, dark areas where light can't reach, which are essential for grounding objects in your scenes.</p>

<p>You'll discover how combining multiple light sources—such as <strong>direct light</strong>, <strong>scattered skylight</strong>, and <strong>reflected light</strong>—adds complexity and realism to your artwork. We'll discuss how <strong>reflected light</strong> from surfaces illuminates shadowed areas and enhances the overall lighting, both outdoors and indoors.</p>

<p>By the end of the lesson, you'll know how to consider the <strong>brightness</strong>, <strong>distance</strong>, <strong>direction</strong>, and <strong>hardness or softness</strong> of light sources, as well as the impact of <strong>reflected light</strong> and <strong>occlusion shadows</strong>. This understanding will help you depict lighting more accurately, enhancing the mood and realism in your paintings.</p>
