<p>It’s time to make some environments. You have a solid understanding of basic perspective and you’ve seen how Daniel Warren Johnson takes those core skills and transforms them into creative environments. Now it’s your turn to make your own!</p>

<h2>Interior Environments</h2>

<p>Create an interior space owned by a Marvel hero. Think about what you can do to give this space personality and a lived-in feel. Choose one of the following options:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Tony Stark’s high-tech workspace</strong> where he can test his latest Iron Man armor prototype.</li>

<li><strong>Scarlet Witch’s study room</strong> where she meditates and researches the occult.</li>

<li><strong>Matt Murdock’s law office</strong> in New York City.</li>

</ul>

<p>Include the hero associated with this room to help set the scene and so we understand the scale of the environment. Remember to:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Think on the character</strong>: Consider their personality and how it influences the space.</li>

<li><strong>Make a map</strong>: Plot the space out before choosing the shot for your final illustration.</li>

<li><strong>Choose the shot</strong>: Decide on the best angle and composition for your final piece.</li>

<li><strong>Scope the small details</strong>: Add elements that make the space feel lived-in and authentic.</li>

<li><strong>Have research handy</strong>: Use references to ensure accuracy and depth in your design.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Exterior Environments</h2>

<p>Draw one of the exteriors of a Marvel Universe location listed below. Make sure you draw the environment at a different angle from any references you see here or online. If you’re just copying another artist’s interpretation, you won’t be practicing all the skills you need for this assignment.</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Avengers Mansion</strong></li>

<li><strong>Doctor Strange’s Sanctum Sanctorum</strong></li>

<li><strong>The Baxter Building</strong>, headquarters of the Fantastic Four</li>

<li><strong>The Daily Bugle</strong></li>

</ul>

<h2>Full Scale Environments</h2>

<p>Draw the exterior of one of these locations from the Marvel Universe. This will be a more zoomed-out view than our previous focus on just the building:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Atlantis</strong>, the underwater kingdom.</li>

<li><strong>Golden City</strong>, the capital of Wakanda.</li>

<li><strong>Krakoa</strong>, a living island for mutants.</li>

<li><strong>Castle Doom</strong> in Latveria.</li>

</ul>

<p>Remember to think carefully about the <strong>shape, size, and readability</strong> of all these environments. Work out the composition in at least three different thumbnails before you choose your shot. If the image works at the size of a postage stamp, it will work when you move to the full-size panel. Keep Daniel’s perspective tips in mind before you start, because that will make or break your drawings.</p>
