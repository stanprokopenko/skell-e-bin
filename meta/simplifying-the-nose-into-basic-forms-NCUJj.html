<p>In this chapter, I'll be going over the nose. First, we'll break it down into its most simple forms and planes so we can more easily internalize those shapes. This will give us a shorthand technique to quickly represent the nose in our gesture drawings.</p>

<p>Then we'll break down the basic anatomy of the nose to better understand its forms, volumes, and how they relate to one another. This will help us see the planes of the nose and shade them.</p>

<p>At the very end, we'll do a couple of value sketches of the nose in black and white to focus on the planes and know how to represent the core shadows, cast shadows, and dark accents that we commonly see in the nose. We'll also do one or two color studies to quickly go over the importance of <strong>subsurface scattering</strong> and using high levels of <strong>saturation</strong> in areas of <strong>occlusion</strong>, such as in the nostrils when rendering the nose in color. This will help us avoid deadening the look of the model we're representing.</p>

<h2>Reference Material</h2>

<p>Before we dive in, I wanted to give you a quick overview of the reference material I've collected.</p>

<p>These images are from <strong>Bodies in Motion</strong>, which is a great resource for anyone looking for high-resolution, quality images that are well lit. They have a huge stockpile of quick animations of different dynamic movements, from walk cycles, running cycles, karate, martial arts, parkour, you name it, it's on there. What's awesome is you can freeze the frames, you can study different stages of a movement. You can really zoom in just about as much as you want and keep a high level of quality and resolution in the image, so you can go and study the details if you want.</p>

<p>They also have a huge stockpile of 3D scans like what you see here. I really like this feature where they add the topological lines so you can really study the planes and understand the volumes of what you're looking at. You can also, in some of the models, move around the lighting to different places. If you wanted to do a top-down lighting, three-quarter lighting, or more of an underlit scenario, you can do that. So yeah, it's a great resource.</p>

<p>We'll be using this to study different nose types. Here you can see I moved it to the front view, and this is a page of all the same nose types as the perspective on the page before. Then here's more of a top-down and then a profile view. I've also collected some close-ups of actual noses of different types for us to study. As you can see, I tried to vary up the perspective and also the nose type as well.</p>

<h2>Simplifying the Nose into Basic Forms</h2>

<h3>Reducing the Nose to a Box Shape</h3>

<p>In this first section, we're going to focus on reducing the complex planes of the nose into a simple box, a three-dimensional box shape. I want to show you how to do that, before we dive into an exercise that we'll do together. Hopefully, you'll follow along, and we're going to use this reference page that I've included in the upper left corner.</p>

<p>We'll do a series of these exercises, where we just reduce the nose to this box shape. This will help you see through the form and hopefully conceptualize the forms three dimensionally in your mind. Really, that's the key to creating convincing volumetric figure drawings, when you can actually visualize things three-dimensionally in your own mind before you draw it.</p>

<h4>Steps to Simplify the Nose into a Box</h4>

<p>First, I'll show you where the vertices or points of this box start and end so it's easier for you to follow along.</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>First point</strong>: Start where the inner part of the tear duct meets up with the side of the nose.</li>

<li>Pull a line down to the side of the nostril, the wing of the nose.</li>

<li><strong>Base point</strong>: That point at the base will be where this edge starts, the edge of the nostril.</li>

<li><strong>Top point</strong>: This point here will be where the nasal bone meets up with the glabella, which is that keystone shape between the eyebrows.</li>

<li>Use that to find the other point to indicate the top plane of the nose.</li>

<li>See this edge here where it shows that transition from the top line to the side plane? We're going to use that to find that line of the box coming down, and then the same on the other side.</li>

<li>Simplify the edges of the nostrils and the tip of the nose. Have them flow into each other into this streamlined, flattened S-curve.</li>

<li>Indicate the bottom plane of the nose. The nostril has some thickness to it, and it actually hooks back towards the <strong>septum</strong>, which is this area here. The septum feeds into the <strong>philtrum</strong>, which is this shape here.</li>

<li>Connect those lines together to find the bottom plane of the nose.</li>

<li>Draw through the form to make more of a three-dimensional box.</li>

</ul>

<p>And there we have it, that is the simplified box gesture of the nose shape.</p>

<h3>Exercise: Practicing Box Shapes with Different Nose Types</h3>

<p>Now, onto the exercise I was talking about. We're going to use these images and do the same approach where we just reduce the nose to a box shape. The box shape is going to vary quite a bit from image to image since these are different nose types. We have narrow noses, wide noses, upturned noses, and downturn noses. So we definitely want to pay attention to the differences as we simplify them down to these boxes.</p>

<p>We'll start with this one since we already did this image, and I'm going to draw alongside the reference image so it's easier for you to follow along.</p>

<ul>

<li>Start with the point where the tear duct meets up with the nasal bone on the side.</li>

<li>Pull that straight down to where the side of the nostril is.</li>

<li>Find that edge where we're flowing the edge of the nostril and the tip of the nose together into that flattened S-curve.</li>

<li>Include the glabella.</li>

<li>Draw through to make it feel more like a three-dimensional box.</li>

<li>Indicate the bottom plane of the nose.</li>

</ul>

<p>You can fill that in with a little bit of shadow. If you want, you can give that a bit more thickness because typically it feels more like a core shadow that that edge produces. Maybe darken the bottom plane just so you have that separation of shapes.</p>

<p>Remember, it's always going to be tempting with this exercise to start adding more detail, which we very easily can. But really, we're just focusing on this top plane, the side planes, this shape of the glabella, and then the bottom plane of the nose, and that's it. This is a good exercise to help you learn the basic structure and planes of the nose.</p>

<p>Repeat this process with the other nose types in your reference images. Pay attention to how the box shape changes with different perspectives and nose types.</p>

<h2>Breaking Down the Anatomy of the Nose</h2>

<p>In this section, we're going to break things down even further, finding more of the secondary and tertiary planes of the nose, still trying to keep things somewhat abstract. I thought this was a great reference image for that exercise.</p>

<h3>Understanding the Key Anatomical Structures</h3>

<p>Let's break down the forms and anatomy that we're looking at.</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Glabella</strong>: The keystone shape between the eyebrows. We'll label it the glabella, and that'll help us find the other point to indicate the top plane of the nose.</li>

<li><strong>Nasal Bone</strong>: Forms about half of the two-thirds portion of the top plane of the nose. The nasal bone feeds into the glabella. It comes down off to the side and feeds into the <strong>maxilla</strong>, which is also part of the skull. The nasal bone helps form the top plane of the nose and a portion of the side plane.</li>

<li><strong>Maxilla</strong>: Feeds into the zygomatic cheekbone. The maxilla helps form the side planes of the nose.</li>

<li><strong>Lacrimal Caruncle</strong>: The most inner part of the tear duct.</li>

<li><strong>Lateral Cartilage</strong>: This top portion transitions into the lateral cartilage, which feeds down into the bulb of the nose.</li>

<li><strong>Bulb of the Nose</strong>: The bulbous part of the nose made of the <strong>greater alar cartilage</strong>. It consists of two parts, two sides that conjoin in the middle right there.</li>

<li><strong>Alar Fat</strong>: The wings of the nose, the nostrils, are actually made of fat called alar fat. They attach to the lateral sides of the greater alar cartilage, and their lateral edge feeds into the lateral edge of the bulb of the nose. The base of the wing kind of has this nice hook on the backside. The bottom edge of the nostril has thickness, and it hooks back in, pointing back towards the septum of the nose.</li>

<li><strong>Septum</strong>: The middle of the nose between the nostrils. The septum comes all the way down and will also have a kind of hook shape that goes back in and feeds into the philtrum.</li>

<li><strong>Philtrum</strong>: The furrow that's in between the two halves of the upper lip.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Drawing the Nose with Anatomical Awareness</h3>

<p>Now we'll try to draw that off to the side and break the planes down, simplifying them still.</p>

<p>Start by drawing the basic structure we learned in the previous section, but break it down more.</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Nasal Bone</strong>: Helps form the top part of the top plane and a portion of the side plane.</li>

<li><strong>Lateral Cartilage</strong>: Feeds into the bulb of the nose.</li>

<li><strong>Bulb of the Nose</strong>: Consists of the greater alar cartilage.</li>

<li><strong>Alar Fat (Wings of the Nose)</strong>: Has thickness on its bottom planes that hook back in towards the septum.</li>

<li><strong>Septum</strong>: Feeds into the philtrum.</li>

</ul>

<p>By understanding these anatomical parts and how they relate to each other, you'll be able to render the nose more realistically.</p>

<h2>Rendering the Nose</h2>

<h3>Value Sketches in Black and White</h3>

<p>Now we're going to do a few more gestures of different perspectives of the nose. We'll focus on black and white renderings to emphasize the planes and lighting.</p>

<p>When rendering, pay attention to:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Core Shadows</strong>: The darker areas where light doesn't reach directly.</li>

<li><strong>Cast Shadows</strong>: The shadows cast by the nose onto other parts of the face.</li>

<li><strong>Dark Accents</strong>: Areas of occlusion where very little light reaches, such as inside the nostrils.</li>

</ul>

<p>Try to apply what we've learned about the anatomy and planes to inform your rendering.</p>

<h3>Color Studies and Subsurface Scattering</h3>

<p>Finally, we'll do a full color rendering. We'll take our time to flesh out the drawing and get everything more structurally sound before diving into the painting.</p>

<p>When working in color, remember the importance of <strong>subsurface scattering</strong>, the phenomenon where light penetrates the skin, scatters, and exits at a different location. This effect is especially noticeable in areas like the nostrils, where the skin is thinner. Using high levels of saturation in these areas can help avoid a deadened look.</p>

<p>Pay attention to:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Local Colors</strong>: The intrinsic colors of the skin, eyes, hair, etc.</li>

<li><strong>Lighting Effects</strong>: How light and shadow affect the colors.</li>

<li><strong>Highlights and Shadows</strong>: Use cooler highlights and warmer shadows to add depth.</li>

</ul>

<p>Take your time blending and adding details to create a realistic and vibrant rendering of the nose.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p>That concludes the nose chapter of the head painting series. We've covered how to simplify the nose into basic forms, understand its anatomy, and render it effectively in both black and white and color.</p>

<p>In the next chapter, we'll dive into the eyes. We're going to take a deep dive into how to draw the eyes and how to approach them gesturally, how to approach their basic construction, and their anatomy, similar to what we did here but perhaps more in depth. We'll cover male and female eyes and different ethnicities to cover the entire gamut.</p>

<p>If you enjoyed this chapter, you'll definitely enjoy the chapter on the eyes.</p>
