<h2>Observing the Shoulder Line</h2>

<p>When I tackle a pose with an arm raised, I look at how the <strong>shoulder line</strong> connects across the figure. In many cases, it runs from an <strong>outside corner</strong> (where the arm is on the outside) to an <strong>inside corner</strong> (closer to the neck). Even if the arm goes up, I can still imagine a line across the shoulders that helps me place the pit of the neck, the collarbones, and the deltoids.</p>

<p>I note that the <strong>pit of the neck</strong> often sits a bit lower in space than the shoulder line. This helps me avoid placing the neck too high or too low while mapping out the torso.</p>

<h2>Understanding the Shoulder Girdle</h2>

<p>I like to recall the <strong>shoulder girdle</strong>: the collarbones, deltoids, and chest all connect as one unit. Wherever the shoulders go, the chest tends to follow in some capacity. If the arms roll forward or outward, I see more or less of the shoulders. This also affects how far the chest or breast tissue reaches out toward the shoulder.</p>

<ul>

<li>If the deltoid sits on the outside, the chest stretches toward it.</li>

<li>The chest often “gives out” about halfway and doesn’t necessarily reach the outer edge of the deltoid.</li>

<li>Think of the <strong>deltoid</strong> as a side muscle. The more I see the side of the body, the more of the deltoid is visible.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Following the S-Curve from Rib Cage to Arm</h2>

<p>I rely on an <strong>S-curve</strong> to spot where the chest transitions off the rib cage and onto the arm:

- Starting on the <strong>rib cage</strong>, the chest curves away.

- Then it follows onto the <strong>deltoid</strong>, creating a flowing transition.

- This flow can create cast shadows and overlaps, like the chest casting a shadow on the bicep or tricep.</p>

<p>I make sure to capture these overlaps and transitions in my initial sketch by tracing those subtle curves. This helps me see how the chest “hooks over” the arm, especially when the arm is lifted.</p>

<h2>Chest and Deltoid Relationship</h2>

<p>Wherever the <strong>shoulders</strong> are, the <strong>chest</strong> seeks them out. That might be the breast shape or the pec line, either way, it tracks toward the deltoid.</p>

<ul>

<li>If the shoulder is raised and out to the side, the chest curves in that direction.</li>

<li>If the arm is more toward the front, the chest reaches forward but may not extend all the way.</li>

</ul>

<p>By observing how the chest “chases” the shoulder, I can place the chest’s outer edge accurately. Sometimes I’ll only see half that distance, rather than a full stretch.</p>

<h2>Practical Construction Steps</h2>

<p>I often simplify the torso into a <strong>tube</strong> or <strong>egg</strong> shape. Then I refine it:

1. Sketch a rough torso shape, indicating where the <strong>rib cage</strong> might bulge or narrow.<br />

2. Place the <strong>shoulder line</strong> and mark where the neck might sit.<br />

3. Add the <strong>deltoid</strong> as a simple bulge where the arm attaches, deciding how much of it faces the viewer.<br />

4. Let the <strong>chest</strong> or <strong>breast line</strong> follow toward the deltoid, being mindful of that S-curve transition.<br />

5. Draw the arm as a tube that extends from the shoulder, adjusting for gesture or personal style.  </p>

<p>I keep adjusting until the torso and the raised arm feel connected. This means double-checking overlaps, like where the chest might cast shadows on the upper arm. I also watch the <strong>negative shapes</strong> around the neck, collarbones, and shoulders, making sure they look natural and consistent.  </p>

<p>That’s my approach to constructing the shoulder and chest region when the arm is raised. Remember, it’s a process of combining simple forms, paying attention to where the shoulders go, and letting the chest follow suit. With practice and attention to these points, I can create a natural, dynamic attachment for the arm in any pose.</p>
