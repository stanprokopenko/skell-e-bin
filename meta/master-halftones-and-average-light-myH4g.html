<p>In my painting process, I often find the need to add <strong>fresh air</strong> to my work. This involves using mediums, which I used to call turpentine but now refer to as "turf." It's important to be cautious with these mediums as they can get messy and affect the purity of the paint. I still have enough unscented paint to start with, but I've used up the average shadow.</p>

<h2>Mixing and Applying Colors</h2>

<p>I'm considering using a <strong>dark halftone</strong> mixed for another painting to add to this one. For the next stage, I'll be transitioning from average light to dark halftone to blend into the shadow. Demonstrating the same technique multiple times helps solidify the process. This time, I'm changing my approach slightly to show different methods.</p>

<h2>Adjusting Techniques</h2>

<p>I'll start by adding <strong>dark halftone</strong> near the shadow and fill the rest with average light color. This approach helps me progress quicker. I'm using halftone thinly to allow for later adjustments with warmer cheek colors. The side of the face closer to the light will have less halftone. I'll apply halftone along the side of the nose where the shadow is. This technique helps with mixing shadow and light for better edges.</p>

<h2>Lighting and Shadow Techniques</h2>

<p>Now, I'll use the <strong>average light</strong> we mixed, applying it thinly to avoid paint buildup. This method allows for more flexibility in adjusting the painting later. The painting will have more paint at the end compared to the beginning. I'm filling in areas with flesh and light, leaving room for variations in form and color. I won't add grays around the chin like in a previous painting with a bearded model.</p>

<h2>Painting Specific Areas</h2>

<p>I've worked with models for years, especially painting pioneer children. I often had to coordinate with parents about their children's haircuts for paintings. I no longer paint children as frequently and enjoy the break. I'm covering areas with average light and will assess the next steps. The upper lid is in shadow, and the eye further from the light is lower in value. I'll tone down the eye to match the lighting. I'll fill in areas under the eye to avoid a tired look and adjust the neck's brightness. The neck is mostly halftone compared to the face. I'll add halftone to the shadow areas to maintain consistency.</p>

<h2>Adjusting Facial Features</h2>

<p>I've covered the average light and will add halftones for depth. I need to add light to the hat and hair, focusing on warm brown tones. I'll use yellow ocher and black to adjust the hair's color. I'm designing the hair with blocky, geometric shapes for interest. The Asaro head lesson on planes influences my approach to hair.</p>

<h2>Designing Hair and Hat</h2>

<p>I'll quickly indicate the robe to avoid spending too much time on it. I want the painting to look cared for, even if not fully detailed yet. The floppy brush isn't ideal, but it works for now. I'll focus on creating nice shapes in the hair and hat. Good design involves emphasizing geometric shapes and strengthening them. The hat's light part is lighter near the light source, following the egg principle. I'll adjust the hat's color using the shadow average and add white and yellow ocher.</p>

<h2>Creating Strong Shapes</h2>

<p>I'm aiming for <strong>bold, beautiful shapes</strong> rather than vague ones. I'll demonstrate creating nice shapes by emphasizing geometric forms. Strong shapes enhance the painting's design and visual appeal. I'm designing the hair with nice shapes, using my finger to adjust as needed.</p>

<p>In this painting process, the focus is on creating nice shapes and strong design. By emphasizing geometric forms and adjusting colors and halftones, the goal is to enhance the painting's visual appeal.</p>
