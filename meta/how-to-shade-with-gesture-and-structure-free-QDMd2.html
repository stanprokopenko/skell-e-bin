<h2>What's in Premium?</h2>

<p>In the premium lesson on the <strong>Tonal Approach to Gesture and Structure in Shading</strong>, you'll learn how to capture both the <strong>gesture</strong> and <strong>structure</strong> of the figure using tonal techniques. We'll cover how to use materials like <strong>Cont√© pencils</strong>, <strong>charcoal</strong>, and blending tools like a <strong>stump</strong> to create fluid and dynamic forms. You'll discover how to simplify shapes with <strong>curves</strong> and <strong>corners</strong>, apply effective <strong>shading techniques</strong>, and render smooth <strong>gradations</strong> to enhance the three-dimensional effect in your drawings. We also discuss embracing mistakes to develop your personal <strong>style</strong> and keeping your work connected through thoughtful mark-making.</p>
