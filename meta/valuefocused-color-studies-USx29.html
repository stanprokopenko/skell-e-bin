<h2>Why I Do Quick Color Studies</h2>

<p>I like to start by creating <strong>abstract color thumbnails</strong> using a simple black and white reference photo. I do it on one layer, focusing on broad <strong>color relationships</strong> rather than detail. These little exercises help me figure out which colors work together while keeping a loose, intuitive flow. My goal isn’t to replicate the photo. I’m more interested in playing with color harmonies, pushing warm and cool combinations, and letting happy accidents inspire new ideas.</p>

<p>I keep these studies small and <strong>limit my time</strong> on each one to avoid overthinking. I love keeping it playful because it opens me up to surprises and eliminates pressure. If you’re trying this, remember it’s not about painting the scene literally. It’s about exploring colors and values in a free-flowing, experimental way.</p>

<h2>Quick Thumbnails and Palette Experiments</h2>

<p>For each tiny thumbnail, I choose a <strong>central strategy</strong>, maybe a complementary scheme (like green and red) or an analogous palette (like blues and purples). I rely on the original photo’s value structure to guide my light, mid, and dark areas. That keeps the study readable, no matter how wild the colors get.</p>

<ol>

<li>I block in big shapes with bold color choices.  </li>

<li>I watch the overall structure: Where do the darkest accents go? Which areas are lightest?  </li>

<li>I keep consistency in my color temperature. For example, if the light areas start leaning cool, I keep them cool and let the shadows go warmer (or vice versa).</li>

</ol>

<p>I also pay attention to where I place my most saturated colors, and I save <strong>bright accents</strong> for spots that need extra emphasis. If I see something feeling too literal, like painting an actual boat detail, I remind myself it’s just an abstract shape and shift the color or value to keep it free.</p>

<h2>Value to Color Exercise</h2>

<p>One of the best ways I’ve found to strengthen my color choices is this <strong>value-to-color exercise</strong>:</p>

<ol>

<li>Draw a simple set of value swatches, from light to mid to dark.</li>

<li>Pick two colors (e.g., purple and yellow).  </li>

<li>Practice matching each of the value swatches by mixing different levels of saturation, shifting the hue slightly, and checking if the color is the same lightness or darkness as your reference swatch.</li>

</ol>

<p>This helps train your eye to see that multiple colors, cool, warm, saturated, or muted, can share the <strong>same value</strong>. That’s how we create subtle vibrational shifts between temperatures within a single zone of light or shadow. With practice, you can do this mentally, without constantly converting everything to black and white.</p>

<h2>Toning the Canvas</h2>

<p>When setting up my painting, I don’t like to start on a white canvas. I usually <strong>tone it with a warm color</strong> because I find it lifts the entire painting later on, and it creates pleasant color vibrations peeking through the brushstrokes. But cool-toned grounds can be refreshing too, there’s no hard rule here. I encourage experimenting with different base colors, as this helps you see how they influence your final image.</p>

<p>Small, timed color studies are a great way to <strong>explore different palettes</strong> quickly. I’d rather paint several thumbnails that capture many ideas than get bogged down in one detailed piece right away. The repetition builds intuition and comfort with color. Before you know it, you’ll be able to look at any photo or scene and simplify its values in your head, freeing you to push color boldly without losing structure.</p>

<p>I hope these exercises inspire you to break away from literal color copying, and find your own expressive palettes. Have fun, play with complementary schemes, pick random analogous mixes, or invent new combinations. When your values are in place and you’re confident with temperature shifts, you will discover endless possibilities for dynamic, memorable paintings.</p>
