<h2>What Are Cross Contours and Why Are They Important?</h2>

<p>If you've ever struggled to draw things that feel three-dimensional, <strong>cross contours</strong> could be a game changer for you. They're super helpful for constructing forms, shading details, and improving your ability to visualize your drawings in 3D.</p>

<p>We know that boxes are made of planes, but what if the thing you want to draw is organic or more complicated than a box? The good news is that you can apply this concept of planes onto any form. Imagine a wireframe wrapping around the form. The goal is to imagine the form and then draw a few key cross contours that help communicate that form.</p>

<h2>Imagining Cross Contours</h2>

<p>It takes time to train your mind to switch from thinking about contours (the outlines) to thinking about cross contours (the forms). If the idea of imagining an entire 3D wireframe sounds intimidating, that's okay. Start by imagining one cross contour line at a time. Pick a spot and imagine an ant trail. If a colony of ants marched across this form, what would that trail look like?</p>

<p>For example, let's draw a sausage. The contour outline doesn't tell us much about the 3D qualities of this sausage. The little knots on the end help, but we assume that the sausage is cylindrical only by context—you already know what a sausage looks like. But if you're drawing something a bit more complicated or new to the viewer, you want to describe the 3D qualities of the form. By adding an ellipse as a cross contour, you create the illusion that this sausage has thickness and is rounded like a cylinder.</p>

<p>But what if it's a banana? You need to show the hard edges. Without them, it doesn't look like a banana—more like a croissant or a potato. How you describe the form on the inside can be really important, and becomes even more important when you're drawing something more complicated than a banana, like a face or a torso.</p>

<h2>Spacing of Cross Contour Lines</h2>

<h3>How Far Apart Should You Draw Them?</h3>

<p>Typically, you might draw one to three cross contour lines per chunk of a form. It depends on the size on the page and how much the form changes throughout. The purpose of the cross contour line is to describe the form at that slice.</p>

<p>On a section of the forearm, you might do two cross contour lines:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>At the wrist</strong>, which is more boxy and bony, so the top and side are flatter with sharper corners like a box.</li>

<li><strong>Towards the meaty area</strong>, which is more rounded like a cylinder.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Indicating Foreshortening with Spacing</h3>

<p>The spacing relationships can actually indicate some <strong>foreshortening</strong>. Imagine a roly-poly (pill bug) from a side view—the little segments are pretty evenly spaced out. But if you look at it from a different point of view, the measurements get smaller towards the areas that are foreshortened.</p>

<p>When you're trying to show foreshortening, you can use the spacing of cross contour lines to inform the viewer that a part of the form is going away from us. The planes that tilt away have closer spacing because they're foreshortened.</p>

<h2>Curviness of Cross Contour Lines</h2>

<h3>Deciding How Curvy to Make Them</h3>

<p>The shape you use for the cross contour describes the form. Not every ellipse is the same. Some curves are very round, and some are a bit flatter. How do you decide how curvy to make it?</p>

<p>There are two things to keep in mind:</p>

<ol>

<li><strong>The Shape of the Form:</strong> Is it flat or round?</li>

<li><strong>The Orientation of the Form:</strong> How is it positioned relative to your viewpoint?</li>

</ol>

<h4>Fish Example</h4>

<p>Let's say you're drawing a fish that's facing slightly towards you. If you draw an ellipse that's kind of flat, you're describing a pretty flat fish. If you draw a more rounded ellipse or even add a little corner, you're indicating that the fish is fatter in the middle part.</p>

<h4>Orientation Effect</h4>

<p>If you draw the same round, fatter fish straight on, looking directly at you, the cross contour line itself is very wide—almost a circle. If you draw it from a perfect side view, the cross contour lines are straight lines down because you don't see the curves. Everything in between goes from a straight line to a very rounded part, depending on how much you're looking at it straight on versus from the side.</p>

<h4>Macaroni Example</h4>

<p>Consider a shape like a macaroni noodle. Depending on the orientation:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Looking from one end</strong>, the middle part is closer to you, so you curve the lines accordingly. The cross contours at the ends are perfect circles because they're facing directly at you.</li>

<li><strong>Looking from the opposite end</strong>, the middle part is farther away, so the curves change direction. Again, the cross contours at the ends are perfect circles.</li>

</ul>

<p>The curviness and direction of the cross contour lines change based on the form's orientation.</p>

<h2>Don't Be Lazy with the Ends</h2>

<p>A critical tip: <strong>Don't be lazy with the ends.</strong> Remember that these lines have to wrap all the way around. The ends usually have the most curve because they're going up and then suddenly turning within a small distance.</p>

<p>Avoid flattening the ends, which can mistakenly imply that the form has sharp edges or is flat. Instead, make sure the cross contour lines wrap around, fully describing the form's curvature.</p>

<h2>Using Cross Contours Along Different Axes</h2>

<p>So far, we've discussed contours around the length of a form, but <strong>you can have contours around all three axes</strong>. You can show cross contour lines along any of the three axes—or all three if you want to be really detailed.</p>

<p>Imagine an ant marching along different paths on the form:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Around the form's circumference</strong></li>

<li><strong>Along its length</strong></li>

<li><strong>Over its top and bottom</strong></li>

</ul>

<p>By visualizing these paths, you can create a very three-dimensional wireframe around the form.</p>

<h2>Center Lines</h2>

<h3>The Importance of Center Lines</h3>

<p>Some forms have an obvious <strong>center line</strong>, like right down the middle of the face or running down the torso. Center lines are a good trick and are easy to understand. They can be very useful for attaching other forms or features and for indicating the orientation of the form.</p>

<h3>Applying Center Lines in Practice</h3>

<p>Think of a head looking up and to the left. The center line would curve around the form, and you might see a bit of the bottom of the head. This wrapping center line already implies the direction the person is looking.</p>

<p>You can further support this with a line wrapping around the top, like a rubber band around the sides, which can indicate the brow ridge or the level of the eyes. These lines make it way easier for you to place the features like the nose, eyes, and mouth accurately.</p>

<h2>Twisting Forms</h2>

<p>Center lines are useful, but they can become more complex when forms are twisting. When a form twists, the center line isn't as simple as a C-curve anymore—it can become an S-curve.</p>

<p>For example, if you're drawing a torso twisting:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>At the top</strong>, the center line might be curving one way.</li>

<li><strong>At the bottom</strong>, it curves the opposite way.</li>

</ul>

<p>Understanding how to draw center lines on twisting forms is essential, especially for capturing dynamic poses.</p>

<h2>Levels of Simplicity</h2>

<p>Cross contour lines can represent a simplified version of the form, and they usually do. They don't have to follow all the hills and ditches of the details. For example, on a face, you rarely go over the nose and the lips—just a curve for that simplified version of the head.</p>

<p><strong>How much to simplify?</strong> That's up to you as the artist. Strike a balance between keeping it simple but not losing any important details. Remember what happens when you oversimplify a banana—it loses its defining features.</p>

<p>Also, consider the purpose of your drawing:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Quick sketches or initial stages</strong> can be oversimplified because that's the point.</li>

<li><strong>Detailed drawings</strong> require more attention to the specific forms within the major form.</li>

</ul>

<p>Even as you add smaller forms, always consider the major form that those details conform to. The cross contours of the muscles still need to feel like they're wrapping around, say, a cylindrical arm. A common mistake is to forget about the major form and flatten it with the details.</p>

<h2>Shading with Cross Contour Lines</h2>

<p>Having a good understanding of cross contour lines comes in handy when shading. When you do detailed shading, try pulling your strokes <strong>across the form</strong>. So the shading isn't just about the tones, but also about how you can use your shading lines to describe the 3D form.</p>

<p>When done effectively, these cross contour-based shading lines can create an amazingly powerful illusion of depth.</p>
