<p>Welcome to my studio. We're going to embark on a journey together, <strong>painting without a brain</strong>. The idea is to approach painting in a way that unlearns old habits and breaks down the process into manageable stages. By following these stages methodically, you'll find that painting isn't as hard as you might think.</p>

<h2>Learning to Paint in Stages</h2>

<p>When I was in art school, I had to unlearn many things that got in the way of my progress. My teacher broke things down into stages. You learn one stage, then the next, and eventually you use them all together. Trying to juggle everything at once can be intimidating. By following each stage carefully, you'll find the process much easier to understand and do.</p>

<p>I aim to make this very easy for you to follow along. I'll tame my hands and not move forward too quickly.</p>

<h2>Working on the Dark Halftones</h2>

<p>Right now, you want to plane out the head a little more. Take steps further into the <strong>darks with value</strong>. Add a little <strong>black</strong> and <strong>alizarin crimson</strong> to your dark halftone, keeping it warm.</p>

<p>In the areas where you'll play around with edges, get them in right now to get a head start. One key area is the shape around the <strong>hairline</strong>. Put some dark halftone right at this area so when you start working with edges, there's a cleaner color to play with.</p>

<p>Push the limit on how dark this can go before it's considered part of the shadow, but still call it <strong>dark halftone</strong>. Mix a little more of the normal dark halftone into it. This area is definitely a darker plane as it goes into the shadow more.</p>

<p>Start establishing that it's a combination of <strong>beard growth</strong> and shade there, and just the light itself falling away. The <strong>jowls</strong> are causing a much deeper halftone, but not part of the shadow.</p>

<p>Add a slightly lighter shadow on the <strong>lips</strong> because they're starting to catch some light, so it's not pure black lips here. Go ahead and interject a little more <strong>warmth</strong> into them.</p>

<p>Any of the little things you thought maybe were not working were because we were being a little too general, making everything fall under the heading of one light. When you go back now and start adding just a few more touches of variation, it's very easy to get closer to what you thought it was going to look like.</p>

<p>It's always good to have those averages, like the dark that we made, so when you go back you can see a little more accuracy to some of these dark shapes too.</p>

<p>Add a little black and red again to the dark halftone for the <strong>chin</strong> because you have a chin that's got a lot of <strong>stubble</strong> causing halftones to get darker. Also add a little more just black for the grayness of the hair against the skin to give a sense of stubble because it isn't just fleshy. You can start doing that now with just values.</p>

<p>Notice that the <strong>mustache</strong> is starting to appear, so you cannot ignore it now. Just put it in with that little bit of a grayer dark halftone, and pretty soon it starts getting more and more like what you're seeing.</p>

<h3>Using the Mirror</h3>

<p>Take a look in the mirror. You're getting there. It will be easy to create more subtlety as you go.</p>

<h2>Understanding Edges</h2>

<p>Now, let's talk about <strong>edges</strong>. There are four kinds of edges:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Hard edges</strong></li>

<li><strong>Firm edges</strong></li>

<li><strong>Soft edges</strong></li>

<li><strong>Lost edges</strong></li>

</ul>

<p>Edges are crucial in painting because they help describe the form. Here's where these edges usually appear on the human head.</p>

<p><strong>Hard edges</strong></p>

<p>Hard edges are usually <strong>cast shadows</strong>, like the shadow under the nose or the shadow the head casts on the neck. A hard edge can also occur where a light area is silhouetted against a dark background or vice versa.</p>

<p><strong>Firm edges</strong></p>

<p>Firm edges are found where two forms meet and have a definite change in plane, like where the bone of the skull shows through at the <strong>cranium</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Soft edges</strong></p>

<p>Soft edges appear on rounded forms, like the <strong>cheekbone</strong> or the bulbous end of the <strong>nose</strong>. These edges imply that the thing you're painting is very rounded.</p>

<p><strong>Lost edges</strong></p>

<p>Lost edges are wonderful because you get to <strong>hide form</strong> within them. This occurs where the background is the exact same value as what's going on in the foreground, so they just blend together. It's a real rest for the eye.</p>

<p><strong>Using Edges to Describe Form</strong></p>

<p>You can tell what's going on with the anatomy just by edges alone. There's a musical quality to varying edges: hard and soft, playing around, creating interest. It's amazing how much you can tell a story about form just using edges.</p>

<h2>Using Your Finger to Soften Edges</h2>

<p>Now that we've talked about edges, let's start using them to our advantage. Sometimes the best tool for edges, other than a brush, is actually using <strong>your finger</strong>.</p>

<p>Look at your reference and notice areas like the model's cheekbone that have a nice soft edge. To get a clean edge, it's best to do <strong>one swipe</strong> if you can. Don't pet the thing to death, which would make a dirty color out of everything.</p>

<p>Do a nice blend with your finger here and there. Wipe your finger each time on your rag, which should be in your lap. You can't do this if you let the painting dry overnight and it's too dry at this point. That's why you have to do this now, even if it's late at night.</p>

<p>When you do this, don't think to yourself, "Oh, every single one of these little edges I'm doing is going to be the final touch, never to be modified again." This is about getting in there and seeing what works. If it doesn't, just go in with your brush.</p>

<p>Use your finger like you're still drawing with <strong>charcoal</strong>. Like you would with actual charcoal. You can do the same thing with <strong>pastel</strong>, it's a really fun portrait medium for doing heads. There's a certain point with pastel where you might think, "Oh, it's not very good at edges," and all of a sudden, with a finger in just like five minutes, it can pop alive.</p>

<p>Whatever doesn't work, go back in with a <strong>brush</strong>, put down some more paint, and re-establish your drawing again, anything that you may have lost with your finger. The finger can't do it all, but it can do a lot.</p>

<p>If you don't have that paint you first put down with those halftones and stuff, this is what the madness ends up having some method to.</p>

<p>There are some areas where you see lost edges, like here. Because the model has growth on his beard and the value behind him is similar, it actually kind of blends in with the background.</p>

<p>You've gone in there, softened some things that help you, and now you can get some of those planes. As you can see, you're drawing with your finger.</p>

<h2>Re-establishing Drawing and Adding Color</h2>

<p>Now go in and re-establish some of the drawing that got off with your finger. You kind of wanted it to get a little out of control in terms of edges so you can really assess what you can do to improve it.</p>

<p>If you look closely, you'll see that it's still fairly monochromatic in just the flesh tone. You were just working within the same color, only darker and lighter. You're not going to leave it there.</p>

<p>I'll take you to the next stage soon, where that can suddenly change immediately. When you just add a few variations of <strong>color</strong>, it'll just <strong>pop</strong>.</p>
