<p>In this lesson, I want to push more into the extreme cases of foreshortening and how to handle them in our figure drawings. We'll explore the use of <strong>shortened lines</strong> and how to <strong>emphasize wraps</strong> to convey depth and perspective. Even in challenging poses, it's crucial to maintain the <strong>rhythm</strong> and <strong>lyrical movement</strong> of the figure.</p>

<h2>Shortening Lines and Using Wraps</h2>

<p>When dealing with foreshortened poses, I focus on <strong>shortening the lines</strong> to make parts of the body appear to recede in space. For example, if the rib cage shifts away and the pelvis pushes back, we have more in-and-out movement. By shortening these lines and emphasizing the <strong>wraps</strong>, we can effectively represent this depth.</p>

<p>For a foreshortened arm, the length might only be a fraction of what we'd expect. The lower arm, for instance, might be much shorter due to the perspective. By shortening the lines and considering the <strong>perspective wraps</strong>, we can achieve a more realistic depiction.</p>

<h2>Building from the Inside Out</h2>

<p>My intention is <strong>never to close off shapes</strong> when I'm drawing. I focus on the <strong>inside lines</strong>, and I anticipate building out to the contour. When I was learning, I challenged myself, <strong>you can't draw the contour unless you know what it is</strong>. The outside isn't just a shape, it is an extension of everything you know on the inside.</p>

<p>So, whenever I'm drawing these lines, I'm anticipating that my build will end somewhere out there. I can <strong>slowly creep up</strong> on the contour because it's challenging, and sometimes I need that forgiving aspect in a drawing.</p>

<h2>Maintaining Rhythm in Foreshortened Poses</h2>

<p>Even when dealing with challenging, foreshortened poses, it's crucial to <strong>maintain the rhythm</strong> of the figure. The animated, active, fun, lyrical movement hasn't left, it's just gotten knotted. I'm working slowly and shortening these lines, but at no point is my rhythm going away. It's still very much foregrounded, and it's important to keep that in mind.</p>

<h2>Strategies for Straight-On and Symmetrical Poses</h2>

<p>One of the most common questions is: <strong>How do I handle straight-on poses?</strong> Well, there are lots of options. You can:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Draw it as is</strong></li>

<li><strong>Push asymmetry</strong> in the back and forth, creating 3D asymmetry</li>

<li><strong>Change it</strong> by turning it a bit or creating some movement</li>

</ul>

<p>If you're committed to the straight-on structure, focus on showing the <strong>forward and backward projection of form</strong>. The rib cage might go away in space while the pelvis comes toward you. This creates asymmetry in space, which is good because our bodies rely on <strong>asymmetrical balance</strong> to stay upright.</p>

<p>You can also <strong>play with asymmetry in the tilts of the shoulders</strong>. Including a tilt line for the shoulders in your gestures can add expressive quality and make the pose more interesting. Try experimenting with that, I think it's really fun.</p>

<h2>Avoiding Common Mistakes in Foreshortened Poses</h2>

<p>When dealing with reclining poses or extreme foreshortening, I often see people making lines <strong>longer</strong> instead of shorter, which is the opposite of what we need. Be aware that you should be <strong>shortening the lines</strong> to represent foreshortening effectively. Instead of extending limbs, make them appear to come toward or away from us by making the lines shorter and using wraps.</p>

<h2>Understanding Weight and Balance</h2>

<p>In poses where weight distribution is complex, think of the body as a structure that needs support to maintain balance. For example, if you have a mass leaning in one direction without something to support it, it's going to fall over. Sometimes it's helpful to consider how weight works in your poses and how the figure maintains its balance.</p>

<p>Consider the <strong>weight-bearing parts</strong> of the body, like the pelvis or the feet. Understanding where the weight is distributed will help you create more believable and dynamic poses.</p>

<h2>Using Ellipses and Technical Drawing Skills</h2>

<p>Getting comfortable drawing <strong>ellipses</strong> can be incredibly helpful when dealing with foreshortening. Practicing ellipses and incorporating them into your wraps helps convey depth and form. You might:</p>

<ul>

<li>Start with a plane, angle it, and build ellipses in.</li>

<li>Practice drawing ellipses that gradually open up.</li>

<li>Use foundational exercises to improve your ellipse drawing skills.</li>

</ul>

<p>I'm relying quite a bit on this technical aspect of drawing to get the figure <strong>forward and back in space</strong>.</p>

<h2>Incorporating Line Weight and Design Elements</h2>

<p>As you get more comfortable, start treating your drawings as <strong>compositions</strong>. Use <strong>line weight</strong> to direct the viewer's eye and emphasize important areas. By pushing darker lines in certain places, you can convey what's important and guide the viewer through the drawing.</p>

<p>Think about <strong>design elements</strong> and how different parts of the figure flow together. Consider how one arm might flow into another and how that creates a rhythm and continued interest in the piece. Incorporating these elements makes your drawing not just a study but a potential plan for a developed work.</p>

<h2>Encouraging Invention and Personal Exploration</h2>

<p>Don't be afraid to <strong>invent</strong> and adjust poses to suit your design needs. Invention doesn't have to originate entirely from your head, you can invent a different position based on elements from various references. The history of painting is full of artists who have taken existing compositions, and <strong>riffed off</strong> those figures and compositions. Painters like Cezanne or Manet weren't accused of plagiarism, they were taking and playing with conventions.</p>

<p>By exploring and adjusting, you might come up with a pose that feels more stable or dynamic, depending on your intent. This exploration ensures that your work isn't just an isolated exercise in a vacuum but has practical applications in your art.</p>

<h2>Understanding the Purpose of Gesture Drawing</h2>

<p>Remember, <strong>gesture drawing is not the final drawing</strong>. It's a <strong>notational tool</strong> to get you started and to develop your ideas. People often get stuck because they think the gesture is the end of the drawing, but that's too much pressure. There's a whole list of steps that come after this, where you take your loose lay-in and develop it into a finished drawing.</p>

<p>When the drawing is notationally done for you, it's done. There's no "gesture police" who'll say you need to do more. When you feel like it's good, it is good. The goal is to understand the position and build from there.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p>I hope this discussion and draw-through of these basic poses help give you a sense of how to take what we've learned and apply it to poses that aren't exactly friendly in terms of their space or foreshortening. I've tried to systematically go through various issues, from seated poses to forward bends, and introduce more complicated aspects of perspective.</p>

<p>Even symmetrical or straight-on views can be interesting if you apply these principles. Keep practicing, push asymmetry, adjust poses, and use these techniques to enhance your figure drawings. Remember, maintaining rhythm and understanding foreshortening will greatly expand your ability to depict a wide range of dynamic figures.</p>
