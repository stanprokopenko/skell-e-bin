<h2>What's in Premium?</h2>

<p>In this lesson, we dive into studying gesture by analyzing works from master artists like Michelangelo and contemporary comics artists such as Rob Liefeld. You'll learn how to observe and apply gesture lines—including the cervical and thoracic curves—to understand posing, body language, and storytelling. We explore adjusting gesture drawings to capture foreshortening and dynamic action common in comics. The lesson guides you through inventing gestures from imagination, drawing poses from different angles, and personalizing your approach to build confidence in creating expressive figures.</p>
