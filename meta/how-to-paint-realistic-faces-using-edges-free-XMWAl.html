<h2>What's in Premium?</h2>

<p>In the premium lesson, you'll learn about the four types of edges in art: hard, firm, soft, and lost. Each type is explained with practical examples, such as how hard edges are used in cast shadows and soft edges in rounded areas. You'll also discover how to apply these edges in your artwork to create depth and interest, using a head lit from above as a case study. This lesson will enhance your understanding of visual storytelling through effective edge use.</p>
