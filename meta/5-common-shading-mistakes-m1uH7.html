<p>Hey everyone, let's dive into shading spheres and address some common mistakes I've noticed in your work. Overall, you did fantastic, but there are a few recurring issues we can work on together.</p>

<h2>Incorrect Placement of the Terminator</h2>

<p>One common mistake is the <strong>incorrect placement of the terminator</strong>, the line where the light transitions to shadow. I've seen the terminator placed too far into the light side, and this makes the lit area too small.</p>

<p><strong>How to Fix It:</strong></p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Find the Equator:</strong> Imagine the sphere's equator, where the terminator should typically be when the light source is distant.</li>

<li><strong>Draw a Proper Ellipse:</strong> Ensure the terminator cuts the sphere into two equal halves with a smooth ellipse.</li>

<li><strong>Consider Light Source Distance:</strong> Remember, if the light source is far away, the light rays are nearly parallel, and the terminator is near the center. If the light source is close, the terminator shifts but indicates a specific light setup.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Incorrect Shape of the Terminator Ellipse</h2>

<p>Sometimes, the terminator isn't shaped correctly, it might not curve properly or resemble an ellipse.</p>

<p><strong>How to Fix It:</strong></p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Practice Ellipses:</strong> Ensure your terminator is a true ellipse that wraps around the sphere.</li>

<li><strong>Check Symmetry:</strong> Both sides of the terminator should be symmetrical, dividing the sphere evenly.</li>

<li><strong>Visualize the Sphere's Surface:</strong> Imagine wrapping a band around the sphere to help place the ellipse accurately.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Reflective Light Too Light</h2>

<p>Another issue is making the <strong>reflected light too bright</strong>, matching or exceeding the halftones on the light side. This flattens the form and can make the sphere look metallic.</p>

<p><strong>How to Fix It:</strong></p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Subdue the Reflected Light:</strong> Keep the reflected light darker than any area on the light side.</li>

<li><strong>Maintain Value Hierarchy:</strong> Ensure the shadow areas remain darker than the light areas.</li>

<li><strong>Reference Value Studies:</strong> Revisit value charts to understand proper value relationships.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Incorrect Value Transitions (Halftones)</h2>

<p>Many of you have a <strong>gradation that's too linear</strong> from the core shadow to the light, or the transition happens too quickly, making the sphere look flat or faceted.</p>

<p><strong>How to Fix It:</strong></p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Apply Lambert's Cosine Law:</strong> The transition to light should happen more quickly near the core shadow, with the light halftones occupying more space.</li>

<li><strong>Adjust Your Gradients:</strong> Concentrate darker halftones closer to the terminator and transition smoothly into lighter halftones.</li>

<li><strong>Avoid Uniform Transitions:</strong> The shift from dark to light shouldn't be even across the surface.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Spotty Halftones and Dirty Appearance</h2>

<p>Some spheres have <strong>spotty halftones</strong>, with inconsistent patches of light and dark that don't align with the form, making it look dirty or irregular.</p>

<p><strong>How to Fix It:</strong></p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Smooth Out the Halftones:</strong> Aim for gradual and consistent transitions in your shading.</li>

<li><strong>Keep Values Consistent:</strong> Ensure lighter areas are where the light hits most directly, and there's no unnecessary variation.</li>

<li><strong>Clean Up Unwanted Marks:</strong> Eliminate random dark spots or smudges that can disrupt the illusion of smooth form.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Incorrect Shape of the Cast Shadow</h2>

<p>The <strong>cast shadow</strong> is often drawn with the wrong shape, sometimes it's too narrow, too wide, or resembles a teardrop instead of an ellipse.</p>

<p><strong>How to Fix It:</strong></p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Draw the Cast Shadow as an Ellipse:</strong> Since the sphere is on a flat surface, the cast shadow should be a perfect ellipse.</li>

<li><strong>Maintain Consistent Proportions:</strong> Ensure the cast shadow isn't disproportionately thick or thin at any point.</li>

<li><strong>Consider the Surface:</strong> If the shadow is cast on a curved surface, the shape changes, but for flat surfaces, stick to an ellipse.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Final Tips</h2>

<ul>

<li><strong>Identify Your Mistakes:</strong> Review your drawings to see which of these mistakes you might have made.</li>

<li><strong>Practice Deliberately:</strong> Focus on correcting these specific areas to improve your shading skills.</li>

<li><strong>Understand the Science of Light:</strong> Remember that shading is about how light interacts with form.</li>

<li><strong>Start with the Basics:</strong> Master shading basic forms before adding complexity to your work.</li>

</ul>
