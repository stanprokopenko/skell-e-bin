<h2>Understanding Gesture and Structure</h2>

<p>Simplify your figure drawings by thinking of <strong>gesture</strong> as curves and <strong>structure</strong> as corners.</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Gesture</strong>: Focus on the long-axis curves that convey the fluid energy of the pose.</li>

<li><strong>Structure</strong>: Use corners to represent the mass, volume, and position of forms in space.</li>

</ul>

<p>By reducing the problem to curves and corners, you can intuitively balance gesture and structure.</p>

<h2>Applying Curves and Corners</h2>

<p>Start by drawing the <strong>long-axis curves</strong> to capture the gesture of each body part.</p>

<ul>

<li>Connect forms using smooth, flowing curves.</li>

<li><strong>Overshoot lines</strong> and <strong>crisscross</strong> them to create corners where forms connect or separate.</li>

</ul>

<p>Use corners to build structure:</p>

<ul>

<li>Corners add clarity to the position and perspective of forms.</li>

<li>They show where body parts align or break away from each other.</li>

</ul>

<h2>The Importance of Connective Strategies</h2>

<p>Mastery comes from your ability to <strong>connect</strong> separate parts into a cohesive whole.</p>

<ul>

<li>Think of your drawing as a melody, not just individual notes.</li>

<li>The <strong>connective strategy</strong> brings life and flow to your work.</li>

</ul>

<p>When adding new parts, look for multiple ways to connect them:</p>

<ul>

<li>Draw the gesture line through interruptions.</li>

<li>Imagine the forms you can't see and connect them mentally.</li>

</ul>

<p>By double-checking and triple-checking connections, you'll build confidence in your drawing's accuracy.</p>

<h2>Practicing with Gesture and Structure</h2>

<p>Focus on <strong>one problem at a time</strong>.</p>

<ul>

<li>Don't judge yourself by everything at once.</li>

<li>Allow yourself to make mistakes and learn from them.</li>

</ul>

<p><strong>Chunking down</strong> helps you improve:</p>

<ul>

<li>Work on specific areas or concepts individually.</li>

<li>Practice drawing vignettes to hone particular skills.</li>

</ul>

<p>Remember, even professionals make mistakes. Forgive yourself and keep practicing.</p>

<h2>Applying the Concepts in Rendering</h2>

<p>Use the same thinking in your rendering process.</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Core shadows</strong> act as the corners of your forms.</li>

<li><strong>Gradations</strong> move over the form, conveying volume.</li>

</ul>

<p>Follow a simple process:</p>

<ol>

<li>Draw the <strong>two sides</strong> of the form.</li>

<li>Define the <strong>shape of the shadow</strong> on the form.</li>

<li><strong>Fill in</strong> the shadow with value, ensuring it separates from the light.</li>

</ol>

<p>Blend the edges to round the corners, transitioning smoothly from light to shadow.</p>

<h2>Simplify and Build Gradually</h2>

<p>When in doubt, <strong>simplify</strong>.</p>

<ul>

<li>Start with the biggest possible forms.</li>

<li>Add secondary forms only when necessary.</li>

</ul>

<p>Avoid overwhelming your drawing with details too soon.</p>

<ul>

<li>Ensure small features don't overpower the big forms.</li>

<li><strong>Vary</strong> the little things to keep your drawing organic and natural.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Embrace Mistakes and Find Your Style</h2>

<p>Mistakes can lead to new opportunities.</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Redefine</strong> what "right" is for you.</li>

<li>Allow your style to develop through exploration.</li>

</ul>

<p>Multiple lines and corrections can add energy to your drawing.</p>

<ul>

<li>Let the audience find the right line among several.</li>

<li>Use your "mistakes" to convey movement and action.</li>

</ul>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p>By focusing on <strong>curves and corners</strong>, you can master the balance between gesture and structure. Practice connecting forms, simplifying problems, and applying consistent thinking throughout your drawing and rendering processes. Remember to be patient with yourself, embrace mistakes, and let your unique style emerge.</p>
