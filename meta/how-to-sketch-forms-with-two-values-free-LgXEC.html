<h2>What's in Premium?</h2>

<p>In the full lesson, you'll see how to use a two-value approach to quickly establish light and shadow. We outline major shadow shapes, fill them with a dark value, and let the lighter areas remain clear. This method is built on the 80-20 rule: mastering a few key steps that produce most of the results. Youâ€™ll also learn how careful attention to value sets a strong foundation for color, temperature, and intensity.</p>
