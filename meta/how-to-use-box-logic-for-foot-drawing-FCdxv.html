<h2>Why the Back View Is Challenging</h2>

<p>I find the back view of the foot to be one of the toughest angles to capture. We need to consider the <strong>high arch on the inside</strong> (big toe side), the <strong>wider base on the outside</strong> (little toe side), and how everything overlaps as it recedes from us. </p>

<h2>Overlaps</h2>

<p>Overlaps help me show which parts are closer or farther in space. I make the <strong>heel</strong> the foremost shape, then <strong>ankle</strong> and <strong>calf</strong>, then the rest of the foot and toes. Each shape overlaps the next, like a <strong>stack</strong> moving away from the viewer.</p>

<h2>Box Logic</h2>

<p>I rely on <strong>box logic</strong> to avoid flattening the foot. The clearer I make my corners and planes, the easier it is to see what faces me versus what angles away. Boxiness lets me establish a solid structure that I can refine or round off later. It also helps me compare <strong>tops, bottoms, sides, and fronts</strong> of each part.</p>

<h2>Breaking the Foot into Three Pieces</h2>

<p>I break the foot into <strong>three main wedges</strong>:

1. The <strong>arch wedge</strong> (the midfoot).<br />

2. The <strong>heel wedge</strong> (the back portion).<br />

3. The <strong>toes</strong> (the front).  </p>

<p>From the back, the <strong>heel wedge</strong> is key. It’s often a slightly boxy or bulbous shape that supports the <strong>Achilles tendon</strong> and connects up to the <strong>ankle</strong>. </p>

<h2>Shaping the Heel</h2>

<p>When sketching the heel, I sometimes imagine a <strong>teardrop or a rounded oven-like shape</strong> with a little <strong>chimney</strong> for the Achilles tendon. Whether I keep it squarer or more rounded, I emphasize that it’s a <strong>flat, weight-bearing base</strong> that meets the ground. Then I decide how wide or narrow to make it compared to the ankle. </p>

<h2>Connecting Calf to Heel</h2>

<p>The <strong>calf and ankle</strong> can be simplified into a <strong>tapering tube</strong> or a <strong>teardrop</strong> shape. I often leave these parts “floating” as I block in the larger shapes. Then I gradually connect the <strong>Achilles tendon</strong> down into the <strong>calcaneus bone (heel)</strong>. This approach helps me keep track of layers and avoid confusion with overlapping forms.</p>

<h2>Putting It All Together</h2>

<p>Once I establish the heel, I figure out how the foot widens toward the <strong>toes</strong>. Like the <strong>chin versus the jaw</strong> on a face, the rear of the foot is narrower than the front. That extra width on the little toe side flares out for <strong>stability</strong>. Even with a slight outward angle of the feet, I can see some of the <strong>inside</strong> and the <strong>outside</strong> planes of the foot.</p>

<p>I also remind myself not to rush. The foot has many <strong>planes</strong> and <strong>knobby protrusions</strong>, and each should read clearly. I keep my lines light at first, so I can adjust proportions or perspective.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p>This back view tests my ability to manage overlaps, compare planes, and keep the structure clear. I break it into <strong>three main wedges</strong> and use <strong>box logic</strong> to find each plane. Next time, I’ll focus on the <strong>toes</strong> and how they connect to the rest of the foot.</p>
