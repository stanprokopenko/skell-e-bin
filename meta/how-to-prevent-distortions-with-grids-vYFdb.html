<p>Welcome to our review of your work for the lesson on <strong>using grids to help with line directions</strong> while focusing on proportions from your orthos. Let's take a look at your submissions and provide some feedback.</p>

<h2>Observations on Line Directions and Grids</h2>

<p>I didn't expect to give much help with line directions since the grids themselves should assist you. However, some of you got creative with line directions, which led to interesting results.</p>

<h3>Hans's Work</h3>

<p>Hans, you mentioned feeling that a grid restricts you. It does, that's the point. Your freehand grid is nice, but your car appears in a wide-angle perspective that is a bit disorienting, almost as if it is driving on the wall. William Montalvo pointed out that you might have used the grid backward. The closest corner should be identified, and line directions should aim toward vanishing points, not away from them. Get in the habit of asking which part is close and which is distant, including up and down.</p>

<h3>Catherine's Work</h3>

<p>Catherine, you had a similar issue. The close corner should lead to a vanishing point in the appropriate direction. Turning the grid around would help solve this problem.</p>

<h3>Rachel Dawn Owens's Work</h3>

<p>Rachel, you had a friendly grid to guide you, which helped in your execution.</p>

<h3>Hans (Continued)</h3>

<p>Hans, despite the sideways grid and drawing, your work is good. However, you'll likely avoid this mistake in the future unless you're deliberately creating psychedelic art. Remember to identify the close corner and understand that lines should go away towards vanishing points.</p>

<h2>Daring to Foreshorten</h2>

<h3>Jovi's Wire Cutters</h3>

<p>Jovi, you dared to put your wire cutters in a foreshortened position, which is commendable. The body looks expressive, almost reminiscent of Expressionism or Mannerism like Tintoretto. Compressing things on the z-axis is challenging because it goes against what we know, but you put energy into it, and I admire that.</p>

<h3>Jacob's Cannon</h3>

<p>Jacob, your cannon is well-drawn, and your orthos look good. However, when you placed it in a foreshortened view, the barrel looks weird. This happens because the knowledge of the barrel's length creates a disconnect when it's foreshortened. It looks particularly odd when the object appears far away, but your box indicates we're close due to the rapid diminishing of the lines. If the barrel is level in the ortho, it should aim toward the same vanishing point and get bigger as it gets closer.</p>

<h2>Proportions and Foreshortening Challenges</h2>

<h3>Lynn's Violin</h3>

<p>Lynn, you've been an inspiration. You were able to self-diagnose that the plane of your violin gets thinner in the more foreshortened views, which shows your discerning eye. This assignment encourages you to look back and forth and make adjustments intuitively.</p>

<h3>Doobie's Work</h3>

<p>Doobie, you noticed that the proportions on the bottom three drawings look strange. The thickness of the planes may be off, and may appear too thin or too thick. This is exactly what this assignment is about, adjusting proportions until they feel right by comparing with your orthos.</p>

<h3>Jay Osi's Work</h3>

<p>Jay, you've done a very good job. I appreciate seeing your preliminary lines, which indicate you're finding directions before committing to heavier lines. However, there's a thickness issue with one of the planes, similar to Doobie's concern. A down view ortho could help verify the depth and proportions.</p>

<h3>Engineering vs. Artistic Interpretation</h3>

<p>If you're aiming for technical accuracy, precise proportions are crucial. However, if you're leaning towards cartooning or expressive art, experimenting with proportions can be part of your style. This assignment helps you decide how precise you need to be based on your artistic intentions.</p>

<h2>Field of Vision and Perspective Distortion</h2>

<h3>Pamela D.'s Work</h3>

<p>Pamela, you did the work and dared to explore different angles, transitioning from looking down to looking more down.</p>

<h3>Sastu's Knives</h3>

<p>Sastu, your group of four knives pointing away is intriguing, but your grid is quite wild. The line directions suggest you've spread out the field of vision beyond normal human capacity, leading to contradictions. We'll dive into this topic more when we discuss five-point perspective.</p>

<h3>Amu's Dedication</h3>

<p>Amu, your dedication from preliminary pencils to finished drawings is amazing. Your hard work is evident, and it's good to see your progress.</p>

<h3>Ishan's Complex Challenges</h3>

<p>Ishan, you jumped into highly developed challenges. While I'm not specifically encouraging it, I'm not discouraging it either. Your strokes may seem manic, but they're daring, and you've even gained some fans.</p>

<h2>Grids and Their Effects</h2>

<h3>Didi's Observations</h3>

<p>Didi, you mentioned that grids can be confusing and have too many lines. Remember, you only need enough lines to guide you. If the grid feels cluttered, focus on the lines that matter for your drawing.</p>

<h3>Angelica's Work</h3>

<p>Angelica, the evidence of your process and attention to proportions is quite good. You observed that drawing across the entire grid can cause distortions, which is accurate. Extreme perspectives can lead to unexpected results.</p>

<h3>Carlos's Question</h3>

<p>Carlos, you asked for advice on how to break the habit of not doing cleaner sketches. The solution is to commit to doing clean sketches, even if it's just once a week. Over time, the discomfort with clean lines will diminish.</p>

<h2>Dealing with Distortion</h2>

<h3>Liesel Draws</h3>

<p>Liesel, your controlled and precise work is commendable. You noticed that the box in your drawing looks wonky, likely because the vanishing points are too close. When vanishing points are placed within the picture plane in a two-point perspective, they can cause distortion.</p>

<h3>Sita Rabeling's Wings</h3>

<p>Sita, your wings are in an extreme wide-angle view, which can cause dramatic foreshortening. Everything close gets very big, and everything distant gets very small. This is part of the clue on how to treat distant objects.</p>

<h3>Mark Marti's Grid</h3>

<p>Mark, your grid has an issue where vertical lines are converging oddly due to a level horizon line. The vertical lines should remain vertical to avoid contradictions. Refer back to the main lesson about comparing your drawing with your orthos to check for surprising foreshortening.</p>

<h2>Embracing the Learning Process</h2>

<h3>Smithies, Spiridon, and Daniela</h3>

<p>Drawing through is more for you than for others. Smithies, your sketches may not be beautiful, but the process is helping you feel less daunted. Spiridon and Daniela, your dedication to drawing through and acknowledging areas for improvement is exactly how progress is made.</p>

<h3>Melanie's Observations</h3>

<p>Melanie, you noted that grid drawing takes longer than freehand drawing. That's normal initially. Just like musicians learning to read notes, the practice eventually speeds up the process and strengthens your skills.</p>

<h3>Espy's Experience</h3>

<p>Espy, attempting to draw from memory adds complexity that wasn't required for this assignment. These exercises are meant to be drawn from orthos, comparing back and forth. If you're taking on more, be aware of the additional challenges it presents.</p>

<h3>Dermot's Struggles</h3>

<p>Dermot, if your grids look distorted and wrong, it's because grids can distort when you go outside the normal field of vision. You're learning exactly what you're supposed to by venturing into these challenging areas.</p>

<h2>The Value of Practice</h2>

<p>This learning process is about trial and error, it helps develop your perception and skill. You're estimating proportions in preparation to measure them accurately later. No one else can do this for you, it is about putting in the work and refining your eye.</p>

<h3>Shan's Vision</h3>

<p>Shan, your work showcases the power of being a skilled visionary. All this technical and intuitive effort earns you the ability to realize your artistic visions.</p>
