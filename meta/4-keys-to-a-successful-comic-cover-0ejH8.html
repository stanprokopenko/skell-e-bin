<p>One of the most common questions I get, right after "What pencil do you use?" is "What makes a good cover?" I think of this as subjective and prefer to focus on what makes a <strong>successful cover</strong>. To know what makes a successful cover, we need to identify our goals.</p>

<h2>Goal 1: Make It Eye-Catching</h2>

<p>Does it stand out on the shelf? A lot of comics are sold and read online. Does the cover stand out in those libraries as well? If not, is it primarily a design problem? We can use <strong>compositional elements</strong> to solve this challenge: <strong>silhouette</strong>, <strong>color</strong>, and <strong>rhythms</strong>.</p>

<h3>Silhouette</h3>

<p>Silhouette is often the first thing we perceive from a graphic standpoint. The play of light against dark is usually what initially attracts a viewer to an image. Do the characters have a clear silhouette that is dynamic and identifiable?</p>

<h3>Color</h3>

<p>Color plays a substantial role in attracting the eye. Colors can harmonize or be very jarring. My goal is to use color to create visual interest and mood, but not overload the viewer. Do the colors pop off the shelf, or are they muddy and competing too much with each other?</p>

<h3>Rhythms</h3>

<p>Rhythms can tie an image together and create energy, both holistically and in individual elements. Do the rhythms guide your eye around the page? Does the composition hold your gaze? Are the characters explosive?</p>

<p>Every cover starts as a <strong>graphic design problem</strong>. If it isn't interesting or eye-catching at this point, no amount of fancy detail or rendering is going to save it. I like to create a sense of the <strong>iconic</strong> by focusing on silhouette and lighting. The shape of an element and how it is lit can tell the viewer a lot about how they are meant to perceive it.</p>

<p>For instance, obscuring a figure with heavy shadow, a personal favorite of mine, can create a feeling of unease while also presenting an interesting design.</p>

<h2>Goal 2: Meet the Client's Needs</h2>

<p>Aside from making it eye-catching, it's important to know what the client is looking for in terms of <strong>logo placement</strong> and <strong>trade dress</strong>. Placing the title in the right or wrong place can make or break your cover. Make sure you have a template or know what the publisher needs in terms of logo and trade dress size, placement, etc.</p>

<p>But don't be afraid to propose an interesting variation on the design elements. Ask yourself: Can they be incorporated into the composition? Sometimes it can be fun and exciting to include the logo right in the illustration as a physical item.</p>

<p>I often use templates from the publisher in my thumbnail process so that I don't back myself into a corner. Avoid placing important elements too close to the edges of the composition, but also watch out for the graphic elements. If you are going to overlap the title, do it clearly and with purpose. Slight overlap can create undesired tangents.</p>

<h2>Goal 3: Tell a Story</h2>

<p>Pick a key moment that captures the spirit of the story without revealing too much and stage it in a clear and dynamic fashion. For instance, a fight between the hero and villain that puts our hero in dire but not insurmountable circumstances.</p>

<p>Storytelling is a difficult one, it's like describing how to tell a joke. I often start with the placement of my characters and the camera, which is called <strong>staging</strong>. I will sometimes even create a little floor plan for myself.</p>

<p>Think of things like <strong>proximity</strong>, not only of the characters but also of the camera. You can create a lot of tension by simply taking the air out of the room, closing the distance between all the elements. Also, you can create a sense of ease or anticipation by opening it up.</p>

<p><strong>Ask a question</strong>, or more specifically, get the viewer to ask a question, something that compels them to pick up that comic to find out. You can have our hero backed into a corner with no apparent escape, or you could introduce some other mystery on the page.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<ul>

<li>Who are these incapacitated soldiers lying at the feet of our protagonist?</li>

<li>How did our hero get to this location?</li>

<li>Why is there a purple gorilla on the cover?</li>

</ul>

<p>The question doesn't always have to be combat-related, but that's definitely a go-to solution to get an exciting piece. Cover stories should punctuate with a <strong>question mark</strong>, a question that can only be answered by reading what's behind the cover.</p>

<h2>Goal 4: Sell the Book</h2>

<p>Because the fourth and most important goal of a cover is to <strong>sell the book</strong>.</p>
