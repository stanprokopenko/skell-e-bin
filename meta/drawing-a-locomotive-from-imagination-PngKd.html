<p>In this article, we explore how <strong>Peter Han</strong> draws a locomotive from imagination without reference. He shares his approach to sketching complex subjects like trains, emphasizing the importance of planning, muscle memory, and observation.</p>

<h2>Planning the Sketch</h2>

<p>Before putting pen to paper, <strong>Peter visualizes</strong> the composition in his mind. He uses his hands to <strong>gesture</strong> and <strong>spatially map out</strong> where elements will go on the page. This physical movement helps him determine the size, placement, and angle of the locomotive.</p>

<h2>Establishing Proportions</h2>

<p>Peter begins by drawing a <strong>horizontal ground line</strong>. He then sketches simple shapes to establish the <strong>basic structure</strong> of the train. By <strong>landmarking</strong> key components like the chimney, sand dome, steam dome, and wheels, he sets the foundation for the drawing.</p>

<h2>Drawing the Side View</h2>

<p>To better understand the locomotive's proportions, Peter creates a quick <strong>side view sketch</strong>. This helps him figure out what he wants to do differently and allows him to rearrange parts as needed. Even though he could start directly with a three-quarter view, this step helps him warm up and plan the drawing.</p>

<h2>Creating the Three-Quarter View</h2>

<p>With the side view as a reference, Peter moves on to sketch the locomotive from a <strong>three-quarter angle</strong>. He establishes the <strong>horizon line</strong> and constructs the basic forms using lines and ellipses. His hand movements are fluid, and he often <strong>ghosts</strong> the action before making a mark.</p>

<h2>Adding Details and Refinements</h2>

<p>As the drawing progresses, Peter shifts from large, sweeping motions to focusing on surface details. He uses a thicker pen to add <strong>form shadows</strong>, <strong>cast shadows</strong>, and <strong>hatching</strong> to define the shapes. He emphasizes that not every detail needs to be included, <strong>grouping shadows</strong> can effectively suggest complex areas without overcomplicating the drawing.</p>

<h2>The Importance of Muscle Memory and Observation</h2>

<p>Peter highlights how <strong>muscle memory</strong> plays a crucial role in his drawing process. Years of practice allow him to draw confidently without second-guessing each line. He compares this to playing a musical instrument, where repeated practice leads to effortless performance.</p>

<p>He also stresses the value of <strong>observation</strong> and <strong>reference</strong>. While he can draw from imagination, real-life observation adds depth and understanding to his work. Visiting places like the Travel Town Museum in L.A. allows him to experience the scale and details of locomotives firsthand.</p>

<p>Peter's demonstration showcases how planning, muscle memory, and observation come together to create a detailed drawing from imagination. By focusing on the big shapes, using landmarks, and relying on practiced techniques, we can tackle complex subjects with confidence and efficiency.</p>
