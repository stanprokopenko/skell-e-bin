<h2>What's in Premium?</h2>

<p>In this lesson, you'll learn how to transition from line drawings to tonal portraits by applying light and shadow. We'll explore how to simplify facial features into basic forms—<strong>spheres</strong>, <strong>cylinders</strong>, and <strong>boxes</strong>—and understand how light interacts with these shapes. By associating different types of edges—<strong>soft</strong>, <strong>firm</strong>, <strong>hard</strong>, and <strong>lost edges</strong>—with these forms, you'll learn how to render realistic transitions between light and shadow on the face. We'll apply these concepts step-by-step to each part of the face, helping you create more natural and lifelike portraits.</p>
