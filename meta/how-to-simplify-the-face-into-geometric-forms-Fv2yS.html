<h2>Basic Head Construction</h2>

<p>Start with a <strong>basic sphere</strong> to represent the cranium. Determine the <strong>tilt and rotation</strong> of the head by adding the <strong>jaw and chin</strong>. Gesture the <strong>neck</strong>, thinking about the <strong>pinch and stretch</strong> as it connects to the head.</p>

<p>Establish the <strong>proportions</strong> by dividing the face into <strong>halves and thirds</strong>. Mark the <strong>brow line</strong> and the <strong>hairline</strong>. Use <strong>four points</strong> to define the sides of the head and establish the <strong>quarters</strong> where features like the <strong>ears</strong> will be placed.</p>

<h2>Defining Facial Features</h2>

<h3>The Facial Planes</h3>

<p>Begin to map out the <strong>sockets</strong> of the eyes and relate them to the <strong>forehead</strong>. Create overlaps, such as having the <strong>cheekbone</strong> go behind the <strong>brow</strong>, to add depth.</p>

<h3>The Keystone and Sockets</h3>

<p>Identify the <strong>keystone</strong>, the area between the eyebrows, and draw the <strong>socket lines</strong>. Position the <strong>nose</strong> using these guidelines and construct it with a <strong>simple box</strong> to understand its planes.</p>

<h3>Building the Nose</h3>

<p>Consider the <strong>nasal saddle</strong> and adjust the width accordingly. Visualize the nose as a series of boxes and planes, noting how it <strong>drops back</strong> in shadow and <strong>comes forward</strong>.</p>

<h3>Constructing the Mouth</h3>

<p>Use the <strong>philtrum shape</strong> to start the mouth. Think of the lips as an <strong>"M" and a "W"</strong> wrapped across the centerline. Adjust these shapes to capture the individual's unique features. Remember the <strong>denture sphere</strong>, the cylindrical form of the mouth area.</p>

<h2>Simplifying Forms</h2>

<p>Always reduce complex features into <strong>simple forms</strong>: <strong>balls, stretched cylinders, and curved boxes</strong>. This simplification aids in understanding the <strong>structure</strong> and <strong>perspective</strong> of each feature.</p>

<p>Pay attention to the interplay between <strong>hard and soft forms</strong>. The <strong>face and body</strong> consist of transitions between these forms, which is important for creating realism.</p>

<h2>Adding Light and Shadow</h2>

<h3>Understanding Edges</h3>

<p>When adding light and shadow, consider the type of edges:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Soft edges</strong> for spheres</li>

<li><strong>Firm edges</strong> for cylinders</li>

<li><strong>Hard edges</strong> for boxes</li>

</ul>

<p>These edges help to describe the form and <strong>control the viewer's eye</strong> movement across the drawing.</p>

<h3>Lighting Different Forms</h3>

<p>Identify the <strong>core shadow</strong>, the darkest part of the shadow that describes the form's turn away from the light. Contrast this with <strong>cast shadows</strong>, which are sharper and result from one form blocking light onto another.</p>

<p>Ask yourself questions about the <strong>lighting conditions</strong>, such as the <strong>type of light</strong> and its <strong>direction</strong>. This helps in building a narrative and adds depth to your drawing.</p>

<h3>Mapping Light and Shadow</h3>

<p>Focus on where the <strong>light-dark division</strong> occurs on each form. Replace lines with edges, as <strong>there are no lines in nature, only edges</strong>. Use the underlying planes to guide the placement of shadows and highlights.</p>

<p>Gradually fill in shadows, starting with a mid-value and adjusting as needed. <strong>Lose unnecessary edges</strong> to prevent outlining and create a more natural appearance.</p>

<h2>Finalizing the Drawing</h2>

<p>Remember that initial lines and planes are a <strong>scaffolding</strong> to help with decision-making around tone and form. As you progress, these lines will become subtler, leaving you with a solid foundation for your drawing.</p>

<p>By understanding the <strong>simplified forms</strong> and effectively applying light and shadow, you'll create a head drawing that feels both structured and lifelike.</p>
