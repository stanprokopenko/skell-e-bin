<h2>Early Love for Coloring</h2>

<p>I think coloring was probably one of the earliest things I did in art. Like many kids, I enjoyed coloring books and spent a lot of time painting and attending art classes growing up. My interest in art led me to art school because I realized I didn't like "real school." When it came time to pick a major, I chose the sequential art comics program.</p>

<h2>From Art School to Comics</h2>

<p>Learning Photoshop back then seemed like an epic quest. It felt like a reward for hard work. At the time, using traditional tools like pencils and paints required significant investment in space and materials. The idea of doing art digitally was like magic in the late '90s. I didn't initially think I'd become a colorist, I was just excited to color my own drawings.</p>

<p>When I was looking for any job that involved art, because I was waiting tables and working at a commercial printer, I stumbled upon an opportunity. A colorist needed an assistant in his studio. I thought, "Cool, that's a job I'd like in a town I wouldn't mind living in." I didn't imagine it would turn into 20 years of being a comic book colorist.</p>

<h2>Breaking into the Industry</h2>

<p>I worked with that colorist for about five years. I started with flatting and doing archival work, but eventually, he trusted me with actual coloring work. He'd give me an issue and let me color it. Around that time, I started attending conventions and met others my age trying to break into comics. They needed a colorist but didn't have any money. Since I was already getting paid to color at my day job, I offered to color their stuff at night just to get my name in a book.</p>

<p>Everything snowballed from there. Those free jobs led to low-paying jobs, which then led to better-paying jobs. Many of the people I worked with got hired at Marvel, and they would recommend me to their editors. That's how I got my foot in the door at Marvel. All of this is a long way of saying, I just kind of stumbled into it. I wanted a job that wasn't waiting tables and used my art degree, and that was 20 years ago.</p>

<h2>Finding Inspiration in Nature</h2>

<p>Nature plays a big role in my work. My wife and I hike a lot and travel in our camper van. We usually spend a month working out of the van, exploring parts of the country we've never seen before. I try to absorb those experiences, make notes, and use them as inspiration. Sometimes, if I'm working on a sunset scene, I'll Google sunsets to find something I haven't seen before.</p>

<h2>Favorite Marvel Characters to Color</h2>

<p>My favorite Marvel character has probably changed over the years. If you'd asked me in 1994, it would have been Spider-Man or maybe Wolverine. But now, it's probably <strong>Thor</strong>. And it's for an extremely personal reason: I've colored so much Thor. I feel proud to be so associated with that character. It's not so much as a reader but more because of my work.</p>

<p>I also enjoy characters like <strong>Venom</strong>, who started as the antithesis of Spider-Man, with such a cool design. I liked when he was Agent Venom, and his symbiote suit looked like armor, that was pretty cool.</p>

<h2>Enjoying the Coloring Process</h2>

<p>My wife and I love to hike and be out in nature, so I always love coloring any natural setting. Right now, the X-Men are set on the island of <strong>Krakoa</strong>, and I love working on stories there with all the lush trees and roots. I almost always prefer coloring natural landscapes over man-made structures.</p>

<p>I also enjoy coloring cityscapes at night. It's a great opportunity for color because of the different colored lights and changing light sources. For instance, I worked on a <strong>Star-Lord</strong> miniseries set in New York, and the night scenes offered a lot of creative possibilities.</p>

<p>If I'm coming up with palettes fairly easily, I really like that part of the process. Those days when I'm not getting a lot done are often because I can't get a palette together that I like. But usually, it's great. So, setting the palettes and then adding the final touches, like doing knockouts and adding glows, are my favorite parts of the process.</p>

<h2>Handling Self-Doubt and Burnout</h2>

<p>We're all pretty big critics of ourselves. I often see other people's artwork and focus on the things they can do, things that I feel I can't. Sometimes that's a motivation to get better, so it's not inherently bad. I'm able to overcome self-doubt, otherwise, I wouldn't have been coloring comics for 20 years. I'm pretty good at "out of sight, out of mind." As long as I turn everything else off, and just go to work, I can power through and feel pretty good about it.</p>

<p>I did go to art school, and learned a lot of the fundamentals. When I sit down to work, a lot of it comes out instinctively, it is long-held training and lots of practice combined. I block everything else out, sit down, and do the work. I can get over any kind of self-doubt once I start working. There's no way everyone is going to like what you do. Just bake that in, someone's not going to like this, oh well.</p>

<h3>Dealing with Burnout</h3>

<p>The first important step in dealing with <strong>burnout</strong> for me has been learning how to spot it. It used to hit me like a car out of nowhere. Now, I'm able to see the signs coming and can almost plan for it. I'll give myself a break on certain things mentally or deliberately focus on other aspects of my life.</p>

<p>For example, instead of walking my dog for 30 minutes twice a day, I'll walk her for an hour two or three times a day. I ramp up other aspects of my life that don't interfere with work. That fresh air and exercise help a lot. The hardest part is catching burnout early. If you're blindsided by it, you're left scrambling because it's a surprise, and now nothing's getting done.</p>

<p>I won't say I haven't been burned out in the last few years, but I feel like I've been able to intercept it. I can walk with it for a bit and come out the other side feeling okay. Find some other things to do besides sitting in front of the screen, but also practice a lot. Go out in nature and look for color inspiration.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p>My grandpa used to say when I'd complain about chores, "<strong>It's better than digging ditches</strong>." Anytime I don't feel like working, I remind myself that this is a great job. There's nothing hard about this, I know what I'm doing now. So, I might not always have the perfect answer, but overall, it's pretty good, it's not very hard.</p>
