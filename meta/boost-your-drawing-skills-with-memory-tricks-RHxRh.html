<p>Welcome back. Today, we're going to make some memories. We'll dive into what makes this workshop so unique, the ability to use our <strong>short-term memory</strong> and keep it in the <strong>long-term memory</strong>. It's an incredible feat. We forget so much, yet there's a very simple solution to keeping this stuff. I once thought I had a bad memory. Turns out, not so much, not when I discovered <strong>mnemonics</strong> and <strong>memory clues</strong>, and how to retain this stuff by enjoying the process.</p>

<h2>The Case of Henry Mollison</h2>

<p>I want to refer to a young fellow called <strong>Henry Mollison</strong>. In 1953, Dr. William Scoville operated on his brain to treat convulsions, and removed a little-known part called the <strong>hippocampus</strong>. The hippocampus is the <strong>internal art engine</strong>, where our memory is first stored to see if it's relevant enough to keep. Then it goes back to the cortex to become a <strong>long-term memory</strong> if it is startling enough to be a life-changing event, or something visually strange.</p>

<p>Henry's convulsions were cured, but it took away all of his memories. He could only store memories for less than 15 minutes, the limit of what he could remember. The hippocampus can only store things for a very short time. It's a short-term memory engine. It has to deem something worthy enough to be transferred back up to the cortex, and stored as a long-term memory.</p>

<h2>Mnemonics and Memory Clues</h2>

<p>I've always been fascinated by memory, and how it works. We'll explore the <strong>body puzzle</strong> and the <strong>rhythm of memory</strong>, and we'll learn from each drawing. <strong>Mnemonics</strong> - strange memory clues - are perceived by the hippocampus, the <strong>art engine</strong>, to be important because they're so strange. Inside of me, I say that's an important thing. It's a thrill for me to understand this stuff.</p>

<p>For example, I remember my sixth birthday so well because I got a giant button that said "six" on it. I showed it to all my friends, and I have that memory stored in my long-term memory now because the hippocampus realized how exciting and strange that was for me and kept it there.</p>

<p>I once thought I had an awful memory, especially for math, until I realized I had an amazing memory if I used <strong>visual clues</strong>. Before the internet, I had to remember lots of things every day, but didn't have what we have today, notes and reminders. So, I would use mnemonics,</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>One</strong> is a <strong>bun</strong>: I'd imagine the checkbook stuck in the cream of the bun to remind me to put a check in the bank.</li>

<li><strong>Two</strong> is a <strong>shoe</strong>: I'd imagine something else I had to remember inside the shoe.</li>

</ul>

<p>And so on. I went from having what I thought was a very poor memory to having a remarkable memory.</p>

<h2>Procedural Memory and Motor Skills</h2>

<p>Something very strange happened with Henry's experiment, something remarkable. They had Henry draw a star inside a star, looking in a mirror so that he didn't see the page he was drawing on. It's tough for anyone. The first time he did it, like anyone, it was a disaster. But he got better each time.</p>

<p>The strangest thing was, when he came back the next day to do it again, he could do it, even though he had totally forgotten the test itself! He could draw the star inside the star very well, because he had drawn it over and over until he got it right. Astonishing. It astonished everyone.</p>

<p>So, what happened there? The short-term memory came back? Not at all. He couldn't remember the test. Long-term memory was stored? Yes, but not in the way they expected. It was stored somewhere else. Thereâ€™s a thing called <strong>procedural memory</strong>, the unconscious motor memory of tasks we do. And that's stored in different parts of the brain that he still had, the <strong>basal ganglia</strong> and the <strong>cerebellum</strong>. That's why we know all that stuff today. Absolutely astonishing.</p>

<h2>The Memory of the Hand</h2>

<p>That's why I have the ability to draw from memory, that, and another reason we're going to explore. I'm working with two powerful tools here. I'm working with <strong>mnemonics</strong> that feed the short-term, and then, because they're so weird, they go up into the long-term memory.</p>

<p>But what I'm doing here is a <strong>motor skill</strong>. I'm using my hand to draw, and you often hear me say about the <strong>memory of the hand</strong>. Now, that seems like a ridiculous idea because there's no brain in the hand, is there?</p>

<p>When we draw over and over, we're feeding the <strong>basal ganglia</strong> and <strong>cerebellum</strong>, parts of our brains responsible for procedural memory. So these <strong>motor functions</strong> are essential for us.</p>

<h2>Repetition and Learning</h2>

<p>The hippocampus also believes that if you do something many times, it's important. Therefore, it keeps it for that moment, puts it up to the long-term memory if it hears it again, and keeps on doing that. These <strong>rhythmic patterns</strong> that I do over and over are very important.</p>

<p>For Alzheimer's, for instance, they're advising people to do puzzles that repeat, and solve problems that are new, and it improves their long-term memory. My father is doing lots and lots of puzzles, memory puzzles, to keep his memory alive. And it really works. He doesn't just remember puzzles, he's much clearer in his thoughts because he's exercised that part of the brain to be more lucid overall.</p>

<p>I'm interested in drawing, so I get the beautiful power of what he's doing within what I'm doing, which is the <strong>puzzle of the body</strong>.</p>

<h2>My Educational Journey</h2>

<p>My math teacher thought I was a numskull. He liked me well enough, he must have thought I was nice but dim. "There's poor old Patrick, he'll never learn." The reason for that was because I'm a <strong>visual person</strong>. I cannot visualize numbers, they would have to be something strange for me to remember them. It would have to be a picture.</p>

<p>So I thought I had an awful memory, and then I realized I had an amazing memory if I used visual clues. I could remember rhythms. I could go "one, two, three." It's very easy for me to remember a finger, "one, two, three." So, it's a rhythm, it's not the numbers I remember, it's the sound of that idea.</p>

<p>A young fellow long time ago called Patrick Jones could have been deemed an absolute dunce by the math teacher and be pitied forevermore if I was indentured into a servitude of working in a bank with numbers, I would always have been the worst there was at that. And we weren't taught art in school, can you imagine? It was not deemed a subject worthy enough for a working-class person to make a living at.</p>

<h2>Feeding the Internal Art Engine</h2>

<p>So, here we are, drawing lots of these from memory. Sometimes, I take a glance at a reference. When you're starting out, use lots of reference, of course, and in between those references, I recommend using the <strong>persistence of vision</strong>, which is basically that short-term memory at its most bright. Draw from a reference, and then immediately put the reference away and see if you can draw the same thing again.</p>

<p>We're feeding that <strong>art engine</strong> and also the tactile nature of moving these lines around with my <strong>memory hand</strong>. What? A memory hand? Yes, a memory hand.</p>

<p>We're working with two powerful tools here. We're working with mnemonics that feed the short-term, and then, because they're so weird, they go up into the long-term memory, like my six-year-old big button. And we're also working with the <strong>procedural memory</strong>, the unconscious motor memory of tasks we do.</p>

<h2>Art, Memory, and Cognitive Health</h2>

<p>You can see why I love the idea of exploring how memory works. It's always been something that has interested me because I have a memory that goes back so far. I can remember being in a pram with the rain on, and to this day, I love rain. It's so comforting for me to hear rain.</p>

<p>As we get older, especially, it is really something to keep in mind. Do it early, and you'll have a keen brain forever. So, my father's doing puzzles, and I'm drawing. Both of us are exercising our brains.</p>

<h2>Mnemonics in Drawing Anatomy</h2>

<p>So, I'm coming in here for the latissimus and thinking of that as a <strong>cloak</strong>. I often think of the forearm as a <strong>baseball bat</strong> or a <strong>tenpin</strong> from the bowling alley. That's an easy remembrance. Now, I say I don't remember math, but I remember rhythms.</p>

<p>I think of the clavicles as arms of a <strong>skydiver</strong>, and also as <strong>bicycle handlebars</strong>. The <strong>three-wheel bike</strong> - you know the ones - they look just like that, had little tassels on the ends sometimes. And that head, I remember Steve Huston, I learned a lot from Steve Huston, said he thinks of the head as a <strong>sailboat</strong>. The minute I had that mnemonic, bingo! That's how I thought of it too.</p>

<p>These memory clues help me build that internal art engine and make it stronger. Tell the hippocampus what to do. And before we discovered the hippocampus, we didn't know we had any control over it.</p>

<h2>Influences and Inspirations</h2>

<p>I was astounded watching Disney artists on screen because we had a TV show called <strong>The Wonderful World of Disney</strong>. At that time, there was no license to show the movies, so they would just show how they made them, and it was fantastic.</p>

<p>I remember my father came home, and he said, "What are you watching?" And it was <strong>Nick Park</strong> before he was famous for <strong>Wallace and Gromit</strong>. He was making little clay people for a TV show for the deaf called <strong>Vision On</strong>. He was making them move. That's why I still love stop motion today.</p>

<p>Of course, you can imagine how enthralled I was by that, just glued to that screen, never moving. My father looked at him with his holy sweater and said, "What a loser," and turned it over to the news. Imagine that? Nick Park!</p>

<p>Last time I saw him, he had three security guards with earpieces walking him down a corridor to make sure that he came to no ill, because he was so precious to this big Hollywood production. He's still the same Nick Park, so, there you go. Look where art took him and the passion for it, never dissuaded.</p>

<p>I was more strongly influenced by <strong>Jack Kirby</strong>, the <strong>Warren Magazine</strong> artists, and <strong>John Buscema</strong>. They were my huge influences, all the way back to <strong>Pinocchio</strong>, the first real Disney movie I ever did see as a full-length feature, and still the masterpiece of Disney as far as I'm concerned.</p>

<h2>Pursuing My Passion for Art</h2>

<p>I was asked, "How did you ever come from that place without a business plan, without any plans?" I said, "I did have a plan. I saw <strong>Frank Frazetta</strong> do it, and I said I'll do that." That's a very simple plan. And I saw that he was able to create a living by painting book jackets and producing posters and making books.</p>

<p>I was laughed at, I remember people thinking, "Don't be silly, don't be ridiculous, get a proper job." And I did exactly that. That is persistence of vision in a different way. And I kept going. So you can really manifest it, and I did so.</p>

<p>All I needed was a piece of paper and a pencil, and no matter what the ruination of the background was, because that's what I grew up with, I found paradise in making art, no matter what was going on around me. And I still do.</p>

<h2>The Value of Art in Life</h2>

<p>Look what art can do. And if you never make a living out of it, it doesn't matter. You've made something beautiful, and you've fed your hippocampus, so you're investing in your mind's future as well. Your mind now will be a stronger mind.</p>

<p>Call it <strong>exercise for the brain</strong>, which is really what it is. But it's more than that, of course. It's a beautiful thing that also benefits others that look at it.</p>

<p>My first thought when I saw Frank Frazetta's work was not, "I want to make money at this." It was, "<strong>That's a beautiful thing. I want to do that beautiful thing.</strong>" And then the hard reality of light shone on me and said, "You need money to do this beautiful thing. You need to go and make some kind of living to finance it."</p>

<p>So, I hope you enjoyed those stories. They're meant to inspire. They're not there to boast or anything like that. Whatever path you take, there's a result from any way it comes out. And that could well be just that you're going to be cognitively better off at the end of this journey through art, and you're going to be happier because you've got art in your life.</p>
