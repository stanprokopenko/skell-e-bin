<h2>Understanding Values in Art</h2>

<p>Values are incredibly valuable in drawing. If you want your drawings to look three-dimensional and create the illusion of form, you need to start adding values. Lines are great and can get you far, but learning how to effectively use <strong>values</strong> can transform your art.</p>

<p>When we talk about value in art, we're not referring to its worth, or how much money it costs. A <strong>value</strong> is simply how light or dark something is. For example, if you take a photo and make it grayscale, you'll notice that some areas are lighter, and others are darker. The value of skin might be lighter than the lips. Even though the colors of the lips and shadows are quite different, their <strong>values</strong> might be similar, they're both kind of dark.</p>

<h3>Value and Color</h3>

<p>We don't actually see lines. As artists, we use lines as placeholders for the edges of shapes. Lines are a useful tool for communicating ideas, but they are an abstraction of what we see. What we actually see is light affecting form, perceived as an arrangement of colors, shapes filled with colors.</p>

<p>Color is made up of <strong>hue</strong>, <strong>chroma</strong>, and <strong>value</strong>:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Hue</strong> is the family of colors it belongs to, yellow, red, blue, and so on.</li>

<li><strong>Chroma</strong> describes how pure or gray a color is. You can lower the chroma of a blue, and it's still blue but with more gray.</li>

<li><strong>Value</strong> describes how light or dark a color is, from white to black. A medium chroma blue might be a value five, but you can shift it lighter or darker along the value scale.</li>

</ul>

<p>The relationship between these three properties can get complicated, and that's beyond this course. The most important part of color, especially for artists, is <strong>value</strong>. It's so important that artists often categorize it separately.</p>

<p>Imagine a drawing is like a building. Each individual steel beam is like a line. We put lines together to make shapes, like the steel framework of the building. <strong>Values are like the walls</strong> - they fill in the spaces between the framework, making it solid. Values create the illusion of form, depth, and volume. Beyond that, you have things like texture and color, which are like the decorations in your rooms, the wallpaper, the furniture. These details contribute to the overall feeling of your art.</p>

<p>As a beginner, it's wise to practice drawing without color at first. Focus on using <strong>value</strong> to represent light and form. Once you're comfortable with values, you can introduce the other elements of color to add more emotional impact. It's tempting to jump straight into color, but if you want your practice time to have the biggest impact, start with values.</p>

<h2>The Value Scale</h2>

<p>Imagine a scale from 0 to 10, where 0 is the darkest black and 10 is the brightest white. This might seem counterintuitive if you think of value as pigment, since we often start with white paper and add darker values with a pencil. But in this course, we'll borrow from the <strong>Munsell color system</strong>, a traditional way of organizing color and value. Instead of measuring pigment, we're measuring <strong>light</strong>.</p>

<p>When drawing, it's more practical to think about how light affects the subject rather than the pigment itself. A value of 10 means that area is getting the most light, while a value of 0 means it's in complete shadow and we can't see anything.</p>

<p>In reality, the value scale is a smooth gradation with an infinite number of values between black and white. However, working with infinity isn't practical for drawing or organizing values. That's why artists typically break it down into steps, usually about 10. This makes it more manageable, and easier to communicate. If someone says value number 3, you can imagine where that is on the scale.</p>

<p>You don't always have to use all 10 values in every drawing. Sometimes you might choose to work with a <strong>limited value scale</strong>, maybe using only five values, just enough to represent the main elements of light and shadow. You can also play around with different value ranges within the scale,</p>

<ul>

<li>Using values from 3 to 8 with no deep shadows or bright highlights.</li>

<li>Creating a moody drawing using only darker values from 0 to 5.</li>

</ul>

<p>Our goal is to train your eyes to see these subtle shifts in value and then translate them into something you can work with on paper.</p>

<h2>Sources of Value</h2>

<p>There are four things that determine the values we see:</p>

<ol>

<li><strong>Local Value</strong></li>

<li><strong>Light on Form</strong></li>

<li><strong>Surface Material</strong></li>

<li><strong>Atmosphere</strong></li>

</ol>

<p>For beginners, it's highly recommended that you start by focusing on the first two: <strong>local value</strong> and <strong>light on form</strong>. The other two are more advanced and can be explored later.</p>

<h3>Local Value</h3>

<p><strong>Local value</strong> is the inherent lightness or darkness of an object, regardless of the light shining on it. For example, the value of hair is darker than the value of skin, that's local value. The local value of something isn't always consistent, and flat. An apple might have a lot of variety in its local value, and a general gradation from light to dark.</p>

<h3>Light on Form</h3>

<p>When you shine a light on something, it makes it brighter, the value goes up because there's more light. But the value doesn't increase evenly across the entire object. The distribution of light depends on the form and how the planes of the object are facing. The part of the object facing toward the light receives the most light, while planes that turn away receive less light and appear darker.</p>

<p><strong>Local value and light on form act together.</strong> For example, even if hair is darker than skin, the shadow on skin can be darker than the highlights in hair. Both apples in the earlier example are hit by the same light, but their values are affected differently based on their local value and how light interacts with their form.</p>

<h3>Surface Material and Atmosphere</h3>

<p><strong>Surface material</strong> refers to what the object is made of. It could be matte, glossy, or highly reflective, which can greatly change the values we see even if the light and form are the same.</p>

<p><strong>Atmosphere</strong> refers to the effect of the air on how we perceive things that are far away. This is known as atmospheric perspective, where distant objects appear lighter and less saturated due to particles in the air scattering light.</p>

<h2>Focusing on Light and Form</h2>

<p>As a beginner, it's wise to practice drawing without color at first. Focus on using <strong>value</strong> to represent light and form. Values create the illusion of form, depth, and volume in your drawings. They fill in the spaces between the framework created by your lines and shapes, making your drawings solid and more lifelike. Once you're comfortable with values, you can introduce the other elements of color to add more emotional impact.</p>

<p>It's tempting to jump straight into color, but if you want your practice time to have the biggest impact, start with values. By mastering values, you'll build a strong foundation for your art, allowing you to create more convincing and compelling drawings.</p>
