<p>Improving your visual memory is crucial for artists. It helps you draw from imagination, increases your drawing speed, enhances creativity, and aids in drawing from observation. By having a large library of images in your head, you can identify important information and recognize patterns more effectively. Here are several exercises, challenges, and games to help you improve your visual memory.</p>

<h2>Visual Memory Exercises</h2>

<h3>Draw from Memory</h3>

<ul>

<li>Look at a reference for a minute or two.</li>

<li>Hide the reference and draw as much as you can from memory.</li>

<li>Check your accuracy after drawing.</li>

<li>Optionally, repeat the exercise to see if you can improve.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Draw from a Different Angle</h3>

<ul>

<li>Look at a reference and draw it from a different angle.</li>

<li>No need to hide the reference for this exercise.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Combine Memory and Different Angle</h3>

<ul>

<li>Look at a reference for a few minutes.</li>

<li>Draw from memory and from a different angle.</li>

<li>Optionally, start with a study drawing to learn the construction of the forms better.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Advanced Exercise: Change Proportions</h3>

<ul>
