<h2>Materials and Preparation</h2>

<p>To add tendons to your hand anatomy sculpture, you'll need:</p>

<ul>

<li>Victoria Brown microcrystalline wax mixed with beeswax (or a similar firm wax)</li>

<li>A different color clay or wax for the tendons</li>

</ul>

<p>Start by rolling out sections of the wax to represent the tendons. Using a different color helps distinguish the tendons from the other structures in your sculpture.</p>

<h2>Overview of Hand Tendons</h2>

<p>Before you begin, it's important to understand the three main groups of tendons in the hand:</p>

<ol>

<li><strong>Flexor muscles</strong>: Located on the front of the forearm and wrist</li>

<li><strong>Extensor muscles</strong>: Found on the back of the forearm and wrist</li>

<li><strong>Ridge muscles</strong>: Wrap around the other muscles</li>

</ol>

<p>You'll be adding tendons from each of these groups to your sculpture.</p>

<h2>Back of Hand Tendons</h2>

<p>Start with the back of the hand on the pinky side and work your way over to the thumb.</p>

<h3>Extensor Carpi Ulnaris</h3>

<ul>

<li>Travels between two ridges on the ulna</li>

<li>Attaches to the bottom part of the first phalanx of the pinky, just above the carpal bones of the wrist</li>

</ul>

<h3>Extensor Digiti Minimi</h3>

<ul>

<li>Travels up the entire length of the pinky</li>

</ul>

<h3>Extensor Digitorum</h3>

<ul>

<li>Branches out to all fingers</li>

<li>The pinky and ring finger tendons stay together until the last part</li>

</ul>

<h3>Extensor Indicis</h3>

<ul>

<li>Goes from the ulna area to the index finger</li>

<li>Travels under the other tendons before connecting to the index tendon</li>

</ul>

<h2>Thumb Tendons</h2>

<p>Move to the tendons that attach to the thumb.</p>

<h3>Extensor Pollicis Longus</h3>

<ul>

<li>Goes from under the other tendons, over and up to the thumb</li>

<li>The muscle attaches along the inside of the ulna</li>

</ul>

<h3>Extensor Pollicis Brevis</h3>

<ul>

<li>Attaches to the bottom of the second knuckle</li>

<li>There's a small space between this and the Extensor Pollicis Longus, forming the "snuff box"</li>

</ul>

<h3>Adductor Pollicis Longus</h3>

<ul>

<li>Attaches to the base of the first phalanx of the thumb</li>

<li>Travels right next to the Extensor Pollicis Brevis</li>

</ul>

<h3>Brachioradialis</h3>

<ul>

<li>One of the ridge muscles that turns the arm</li>

<li>Attaches to the bony bump on the radius</li>

<li>Ends before the wrist</li>

</ul>

<h2>Palm Side Tendons</h2>

<p>Now move to the palm side of the hand.</p>

<h3>Flexor Pollicis Longus</h3>

<ul>

<li>Attaches to the inside part of the thumb</li>

</ul>

<h3>Flexor Carpi Radialis</h3>

<ul>

<li>Attaches to the inside part of the palm near the wrist</li>

<li>Travels alongside the Flexor Pollicis Longus</li>

</ul>

<h3>Flexor Digitorum Profundus</h3>

<ul>

<li>Spreads out to tendons for each finger</li>

<li>Runs along the inside of the fingers all the way to the tips</li>

</ul>

<h3>Flexor Digitorum Superficialis</h3>

<ul>

<li>Overlaps with the Flexor Digitorum Profundus tendons</li>

</ul>

<h3>Flexor Carpi Ulnaris</h3>

<ul>

<li>Attaches to the bony protrusion on the carpal bones</li>

<li>Travels down along the arm</li>

</ul>

<h2>Tips and Recommendations</h2>

<ul>

<li>Start with the back of the hand towards the pinky side and work your way around</li>

<li>Prepare your clay coils ahead of time to save time during the sculpting process</li>

<li>Use a different colored clay for the tendons to distinguish them from other structures</li>

</ul>

<p>Remember, understanding the tendons, bones of the wrist, and muscles of the hand is crucial for sculpting a realistic hand. While the forearm muscles are primarily responsible for hand movement, this focus on hand anatomy will greatly improve your hand sculptures.</p>

<p>By following these steps and paying attention to the details of each tendon group, you'll create a comprehensive and anatomically accurate hand study sculpture. Keep practicing and stay creative!</p>
