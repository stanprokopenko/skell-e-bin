<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>I’ve been reviewing your portrait blob studies, and our main focus here is on <strong>edges</strong>, that transition where light meets shadow. It can be soft, firm, or very sharp. We’re aiming to interpret each portrait as a collection of bigger blob-like forms, rather than an exact likeness or detailed rendering of every facial feature. That simplification lets us focus on edges without worrying about tiny details.</p>

<p>Below, I’ll share my observations, the common corner-cutting, and how we can push our blob exercises even further.</p>

<h2>Light Sources and Form</h2>

<p>Light direction is key. If it’s from above, cast shadows often appear under the nose or chin. If it’s directed below (like a flashlight under the face), shadows shift upward. For multiple light sources, decide which is dominant and downplay the others to avoid confusion.</p>

<p>• A strong, close light (like a flashlight) casts <strong>sharp</strong> shadows.<br />

• A soft, diffused light (like an overcast day) creates <strong>softer</strong> shadows.  </p>

<p>It’s fine to alter cast shadows if they obscure important areas, but be intentional. If you change the nose’s shadow so you can see the eyes, know why you’re doing it instead of just ignoring the form.</p>

<h2>Sharp, Firm, and Soft Edges</h2>

<p>Understanding the difference between these three edge types is crucial:</p>

<p><strong>Sharp Edges</strong><br />

I like to think of a sharp edge as where light and shadow meet abruptly, often a cast shadow from the nose onto the cheek. A direct light that’s close to the subject will boost these sharper boundaries.</p>

<p><strong>Firm Edges</strong><br />

Firm edges are a bit softer than sharp edges. You might see these where a form turns more gradually, yet you still sense an edge. Think of the brow ridge: not as razor-sharp as a cast shadow, but not so blurry that it disappears.</p>

<p><strong>Soft Edges</strong><br />

Soft edges are gentle transitions, like the roundness at the top of the forehead or cheeks. On many portraits, especially with diffused light, the entire forehead or cheek can feel like one continuous gradation into shadow.</p>

<p>One of the biggest struggles I see is that many of you use only <strong>one type</strong> of edge everywhere. That can give a cloudy or overly firm look. Real faces blend these edges in countless ways.</p>

<h2>Practicing with Blobs</h2>

<p>When we say “blobs,” we’re talking about simpler shapes for the nose, cheekbones, chin, and so on. The point is to focus on how light falls on these big forms. It helps to:</p>

<p>• Identify large overlapping shapes (like the “tuna can” muzzle or “egg” for the cranium).<br />

• Combine or “melt” these shapes where they meet, avoid leaving gaps.

• Clearly separate light from shadow before refining transitions.  </p>

<p>Use enough variety in those blobs to capture the subtle planes: a nose form might be tapered, a cheek might spread wide before curving around to the jaw. If all your blobs are the same oval size, it won’t feel like a face.</p>

<h2>Common Observations</h2>

<ol>

<li>

<p><strong>Overly Soft Everywhere</strong><br />

    Many of you defaulted to super-blurry edges, creating a cloudy effect. Real faces have firm or sharp edges where forms intersect. Don’t be afraid to add sharpness in the cast shadows.</p>

</li>

<li>

<p><strong>Overly Firm Everywhere</strong><br />

    Some of you favored planes so much that the forehead and cheeks became hard corners. Soften those surfaces that really are round in life.</p>

</li>

<li>

<p><strong>Value Confusion</strong><br />

    Watch that your shadows are dark and consistent so they read as a grouped shape. If you lighten a shadow too much, it blurs into your half tones. Keep half tones lighter than your shadows and don’t let them mix randomly.</p>

</li>

<li>

<p><strong>Outlining</strong><br />

    You don’t need a dark line to denote a sharp edge in the light family. You can just have a strong jump in value. If you outline everything, it can look cartoonish and flattened.</p>

</li>

<li>

<p><strong>Busy, Messy Transitions</strong><br />

    Smudging all over can leave chaotic halftones that read like random scribbles. A soft edge should still have a clean, controlled feel even if it’s smooth.</p>

</li>

<li>

<p><strong>Light Sources Conflicts</strong><br />

    In references with multiple light sources, choose a main light to emphasize. Subdue any extra lights so you don’t get lost in inconsistent highlights.</p>

</li>

</ol>

<h2>Example Feedback Highlights</h2>

<p>• One student replaced the portrait’s face with Luigi, maintaining the light from the reference. That’s a great approach to keep things fun. But remember to keep the nose cast shadow consistent, especially if the hat’s brim is also casting a shadow.<br />

• Some worked from a tricky photo, with bottom light. Good job on capturing the sense of light shining upward. Just be sure those upward-cast shadows remain sharp, flashlights tend to create crisp outlines.

• Others simplified the head shape nicely but missed big transitional blobs for the jaw and cheek. If you use tiny separate ovals, you’ll get random lumps rather than coherent forms.</p>

<h2>Clean Edges Moving Forward</h2>

<p>It might feel frustrating at first. Our simplified blob heads do look like “ugly potatoes” sometimes! That’s fine. Our goal is to study edges and how light wraps around or cuts across forms. Once you’re comfortable creating sharp versus soft transitions, you’ll see a big improvement in your realistic renders.</p>

<p>Keep practicing with larger, cleaner, more strategic edges. If you see everything turning too soft, find areas for sharper transitions at the cast shadows. If everything’s stiff and planar, soften at the rounder forehead and cheeks.</p>

<h2>Next Steps</h2>

<p>In the upcoming warmup, I’ll show you how to train for cleaner edges, without the messy transitions. We’ll then start merging these lessons into more realistic shading. Continue sketching portraits you find interesting, but stay mindful of edges and values. With each drawing, you’ll see the forms appear more solid, whether it’s a real person or your favorite character turned into a blob.</p>

<p>Let’s keep going!</p>
