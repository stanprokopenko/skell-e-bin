<p>In this lesson, we'll study the eye using classical sculpture references. By focusing on these simplified forms, we can better understand the underlying structures without the distractions of color and detail. Let's dive into sketching and analyzing the eye from different angles.</p>

<h2>Sketching the Profile View</h2>

<p>I chose a profile view of a sculpture to start because it aligns with our recent study of the skull's profile.</p>

<h3>Observing Key Landmarks</h3>

<ul>

<li><strong>Brow Ridge</strong>: Notice how prominent it is, extending above the hood of the eye. This creates a contrast between hard bone structures and softer tissues.</li>

<li><strong>Eye Socket</strong>: The eyeball is recessed about half an inch from where the nasal bone meets the glabella.</li>

<li><strong>Nasal Bone</strong>: It has a strong ridge transitioning into the nose's lateral cartilage.</li>

<li><strong>Zygomatic Bone</strong>: Observe the protrusion of the cheekbone.</li>

</ul>

<p>Understanding these landmarks helps in creating a sense of structure and visual interest in our drawings.</p>

<h3>Starting the Sketch</h3>

<ol>

<li><strong>Light Gesture</strong>: Begin by lightly blocking out the eye socket's simple design.</li>

<li><strong>Hood of the Eye</strong>: Sketch the fat that sits atop the upper eyelid, noting how it hangs over.</li>

<li><strong>Eyeball</strong>: Lightly indicate the sphere of the eyeball resting in the socket.</li>

<li><strong>Eyelids</strong>: Observe how the eyelids wrap around the eyeball, with the upper eyelid overlapping the lower.</li>

<li><strong>Shadow Shapes</strong>: Pay attention to cast shadows, like those from the brow line and upper eyelid.</li>

<li><strong>Iris</strong>: Even if simplified, you can fill it in with some value to represent it.</li>

</ol>

<h3>Rendering Shadows and Light</h3>

<ul>

<li><strong>Upper Plane of Lower Eyelid</strong>: This catches light and should be lighter.</li>

<li><strong>Thickness of Eyelids</strong>: The upper eyelid's thickness is usually in shadow and casts a shadow.</li>

<li><strong>Directional Light</strong>: Identify the light source to accurately render shadows.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Final Touches</h3>

<ul>

<li><strong>Flatten Shadows</strong>: Go back and reinforce shadow areas for depth.</li>

<li><strong>Soft Transitions</strong>: Soften gradients where forms turn away from the light.</li>

<li><strong>Anatomical Notes</strong>: Recall that learning anatomical names, like "lacrimal" for the tear duct, can aid in understanding and drawing.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Front View Sketch of Michelangelo's David</h2>

<p>Next, we study the front view using the eyes of Michelangelo's David.</p>

<h3>Laying the Foundations</h3>

<ol>

<li><strong>Gesture Lines</strong>: Start with horizontal lines for the brow and eye lines.</li>

<li><strong>Glabella</strong>: Establish the keystone shape between the eyes.</li>

<li><strong>Furrowed Brow</strong>: Lightly indicate creases for expression.</li>

<li><strong>Eye Alignment</strong>: Use gestural lines to connect and align the eyes symmetrically.</li>

</ol>

<h3>Constructing the Eyes</h3>

<ul>

<li><strong>Simplify with Straights</strong>: Use straight lines to block in the eye shapes before refining with curves.</li>

<li><strong>Corners of the Eyes</strong>: Mark the tear ducts and ensure they're evenly placed.</li>

<li><strong>Symmetry Check</strong>: Continuously use horizontal lines to maintain symmetry.</li>

<li><strong>Iris and Pupil</strong>: Carefully place the irises and pupils, noting the sculpture's stylization.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Adding Values and Rendering</h3>

<ol>

<li><strong>Separate Lights and Darks</strong>: Use a value wash to establish mid-tones, then block in shadows.</li>

<li><strong>Foreground Highlights</strong>: Identify and render planes perpendicular to the light source.</li>

<li><strong>Brushwork</strong>: Use a textured square brush to give a carved, sculptural feel.</li>

<li><strong>Bounce Light</strong>: Add subtle light reflecting onto the lower eyelids from the cheeks.</li>

</ol>

<h3>Refining the Details</h3>

<ul>

<li><strong>Eyelid Thickness</strong>: Emphasize the thick planes of the eyelids, avoiding paper-thin portrayals.</li>

<li><strong>Cast Shadows</strong>: Accentuate shadows cast by the brow and eyelids for depth.</li>

<li><strong>Value Variation</strong>: Introduce nuances in value for a more realistic rendering.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Tips for Drawing Eyes</h2>

<ul>

<li><strong>Use Gestural Lines</strong>: Connect features with horizontal lines to maintain structure and symmetry.</li>

<li><strong>Start Broad, Then Refine</strong>: Begin with large, simple shapes before adding details.</li>

<li><strong>Understand the Anatomy</strong>:<ul>

<li><strong>Pupil</strong>: The central point of the eye.</li>

<li><strong>Iris</strong>: The colored ring surrounding the pupil.</li>

<li><strong>Sclera</strong>: The white of the eye.</li>

<li><strong>Eyelids</strong>: Both upper and lower have thickness and should wrap around the eyeball.</li>

<li><strong>Lacrimal Caruncle</strong>: The fleshy part of the tear duct.</li>

</ul>

</li>

<li><strong>Eyelid Planes</strong>: Remember that the upper eyelid overlaps the lower, creating depth.</li>

<li><strong>Avoid Thin Eyelids</strong>: Thick eyelids add realism.</li>

<li><strong>Light Source Awareness</strong>: Always consider where the light is coming from to accurately render shadows and highlights.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Benefits of Studying Sculptures</h2>

<ul>

<li><strong>Simplification</strong>: Sculptures strip away details, allowing focus on form and structure.</li>

<li><strong>Value Practice</strong>: Working in grayscale helps improve understanding of light and shadow.</li>

<li><strong>Anatomical Clarity</strong>: Without color distractions, anatomical landmarks are more evident.</li>

<li><strong>Learning from Masters</strong>: Observing how classical artists simplified and designed anatomy enhances our own skills.</li>

</ul>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p>By studying eyes from classical sculptures, we gain a deeper understanding of the underlying structures and improve our ability to render them accurately. Remember to start with basic shapes, maintain symmetry through gestural lines, and be mindful of the anatomical details. Practice these techniques, and you'll see improvement in your drawings of the eyes.</p>
