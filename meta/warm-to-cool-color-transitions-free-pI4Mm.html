<h2>What's in Premium?</h2>

<p>Learn a fast, repeatable system for spotting and mixing color temperature. The full lesson walks you through three mini-charts—Hue-Only, Saturation-Only, and a Combined drift—that train your eye to ask one question: “Is this stroke warmer or cooler than its neighbor?” You’ll see how gray flips identity in different contexts, practice a daily warm-up that sharpens decisions before you touch the canvas, and study a John Singer Sargent passage to watch the warm-to-cool ride in a real painting. Clear steps, no gaps, immediate studio payoff.  </p>
