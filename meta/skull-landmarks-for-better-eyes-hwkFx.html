<p>In this chapter, we'll focus on the basic anatomy and structure of human eyes. We'll start by examining the underlying form of the skull around the eyes, which is crucial for accurate rendering. Then, we'll study classical sculptures to grasp the basic forms of the eyes.</p>

<h2>Front View of the Skull</h2>

<p>I begin by using the <strong>Loomis method</strong> to block in the overall gesture of the skull. For those unfamiliar, you draw a sphere to represent the cranium, then cut it in half with a line to find the brow line. From there, pull out the mass of the jaw.</p>

<p>To get the proportions right, I divide the skull into thirds:</p>

<ul>

<li>From the <strong>top of the skull to the brow line</strong> is one third.</li>

<li>From the <strong>brow line to the base of the nose</strong> is the second third.</li>

<li>From the <strong>base of the nose to the base of the chin</strong> is the final third.</li>

</ul>

<p>With this sketch, I add details.</p>

<h3>The Temporal Line and Eye Sockets</h3>

<p>I establish the <strong>temporal line</strong>, an edge on the side of the skull that flows into the lateral side of the eye socket. This connects the side and front structures. I use upside-down curves to get the flow of the top of the eye sockets.</p>

<h3>The Glabella (Keystone Shape)</h3>

<p>Next, I focus on the <strong>glabella</strong>, or the keystone shape between the eyes. It's a vital landmark for establishing the rest of the face. Building out from the glabella ensures accurate distance between the eyes. The <strong>nasal bone</strong> extends from here.</p>

<h3>Simplifying the Eye Sockets</h3>

<p>I simplify the eye sockets as <strong>box shapes that tilt downward</strong>, like <strong>WALL-E's eyes</strong>. This helps in understanding their form and placement. I add value to the cavity, noting openings at the back for the optic nerve.</p>

<h3>The Brow Ridge</h3>

<p>Understanding the <strong>brow ridge</strong>, or <strong>superciliary eminence</strong>, affects where you place the eyebrows. A strong brow ridge gives a rugged appearance, like <strong>Harrison Ford</strong>.</p>

<h2>Side View of the Skull</h2>

<p>For the profile, I use the <strong>Loomis method</strong> again. The cranium is more oblong, so I extend the sphere for the face. A smaller circle indicates the <strong>temporal line</strong>, helping find the brow line.</p>

<h3>Eye Socket in Profile</h3>

<p>From the side, the upper line of the eye socket is a straight angle, while the side plane curves down. The <strong>glabella</strong> and <strong>nasal bone</strong> connect back into the eye socket's side line, forming an accurate shape.</p>

<h3>Cheekbone and Zygomatic Arch</h3>

<p>I draw a line from the glabella to the cheekbone, which recedes and connects to the <strong>zygomatic arch</strong>. This clarifies how the cheekbone interacts with the eye socket.</p>

<h3>Importance for Drawing Eyes</h3>

<p>Studying the skull reveals the <strong>bony landmarks</strong> that appear beneath the skin. It shows how the <strong>eyeball</strong> sits about half an inch behind where the glabella and nasal bone meet. This is crucial for depicting the <strong>sclera</strong> and how the eyelids wrap around the eye.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p>Understanding the skull's structure is essential for drawing realistic eyes. Simplifying forms and using methods like the Loomis method help construct lifelike eyes. Next, we'll study classical sculptures to deepen our understanding.</p>
