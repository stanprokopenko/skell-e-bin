<p>One of the best ways to <strong>learn how to draw</strong> is to <strong>study good drawings</strong>. But which drawings should you study, and how should you study them? Let's explore these questions by examining the work of a drawing master and focus on <strong>learning perspective</strong>.</p>

<h2>The Five Methods to Create the Illusion of Depth</h2>

<p>In our last lesson, we discussed five or six tricks to create the illusion of depth:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Diminution</strong></li>

<li><strong>Atmospheric Perspective</strong></li>

<li><strong>Convergence</strong></li>

<li><strong>Rendering</strong></li>

<li><strong>Foreshortening</strong></li>

<li><strong>Overlap</strong></li>

</ul>

<p>Now, let's see how an artist used these methods in practice.</p>

<h2>Analyzing Winsor McCay's Work</h2>

<p>Winsor McCay created the <strong>"Little Nemo in Slumberland"</strong> panels before your grandparents were born, no matter how old you are. These were drawn lightly and loosely with pencil, inked with a dip pen, and then colored using a printing process. While those are valuable art lessons, let's focus on how McCay used the five methods to create depth and how you can apply these techniques to your own work.</p>

<h3>Panel Analysis: The Cannonballs</h3>

<p>In this panel, McCay showcases <strong>diminution</strong>. The cannonballs vary in size, with the largest appearing closest to us. Even though there's no <strong>atmospheric perspective</strong>, each cannonball is the same hard black, we perceive the bigger ones as closer. It's not a miracle, it's a trick of diminution.</p>

<p>Regarding atmospheric perspective, there isn't any between us and the cannonballs. However, in previous panels, McCay uses a bit of atmosphere between us and a distant ship, perhaps to give an illusion of safety, implying the ship won't harm us. This is a <strong>storytelling strategy</strong>.</p>

<p>Did McCay use <strong>convergence</strong> here? Not much, it's mostly hidden. As for <strong>rendering</strong>, you can see it in the highlights on the cannonballs, and some patches of tone. It's subtle, but present.</p>

<p><strong>Foreshortening</strong> is evident in the figures. Several bodies are drawn in foreshortened positions, adding to the illusion of depth. Interestingly, despite the overlap of people, not a single cannonball overlaps with another. That's a remarkable use of composition.</p>

<h3>Gertie the Dinosaur</h3>

<p>This is from the early days of animation, featuring the same artist. Notice how McCay used <strong>overlap</strong> throughout this piece. The ridges on Gertie's neck get smaller as they recede, though their actual size might vary in reality.</p>

<p>There's not much <strong>diminution</strong> in this image regarding Gertie's legs. The front and back legs are the same size, even though the back legs are several steps behind. The reason is that we're not close enough to Gertie for diminution to be noticeable. If we were closer, the front leg would appear significantly larger than the back legs. Closeness changes everything, a concept we'll dive into when we discuss proximity.</p>

<p>However, there's definite diminution in the surrounding landscape. For example, the shoreline lump is big enough to build a house, yet it appears much smaller than Gertie within the picture. That's diminution at work.</p>

<p>As for <strong>convergence</strong>, there aren't parallel lines to consider here. The road is almost in one-point perspective if it were straight, but since it's not, convergence isn't a significant factor in this piece.</p>

<p><strong>Foreshortening</strong> is present, especially in Gertie's head. It's an odd angle, and you need to recognize that she's looking away to understand the perspective. Foreshortening can be confusing, but when done well, especially in animation, it appears natural.</p>

<h3>Little Nemo Panel with Staircase and Princess</h3>

<p>This panel showcases <strong>convergence</strong>. The perspective is complex but essentially a two-point perspective, made intricate by the stair steps. McCay includes a great deal of estimating the relative sizes of pillars and planters, but his keen eye ensures the receding lines align closely with their vanishing points.</p>

<p>There's extensive use of <strong>overlap</strong>, enriching the space with over twenty figures. Even a touch of <strong>atmospheric perspective</strong> is present, as lines lighten in the distance.</p>

<p>When studying masters like McCay, take your time. Enjoy the picture, savor it, and perhaps even copy it. But when learning perspective, don't merely copy, <strong>analyze</strong>. Notice the five methods the artist uses to create the illusion of depth, and look for techniques we haven't mentioned.</p>

<h3>Overlap Extravaganza Panel</h3>

<p>In this intense example, <strong>overlap</strong> takes center stage. Lines lighten in the distance, indicating some <strong>atmosphere</strong>. There's a bit of <strong>foreshortening</strong> too. For instance, the princess is bowing, and overlap places her shoulders beyond her torso and her head beyond her shoulders, enhancing the foreshortening effect.</p>

<p>There's some <strong>diminution</strong>, the guards are all the same height, but the front ones appear larger because they're closer. <strong>Convergence</strong> is subtly embedded, the guards are lined up in one-point perspective.</p>

<p>Beyond perspective, notice how the lines of convergence point toward the fairy's face, the pinnacle of the picture. This is <strong>composition</strong> at work, arranging the picture to draw attention to key elements. While the beautiful color and stained-glass style are marvelous, we are focusing on perspective here.</p>

<h3>Finale Panel</h3>

<p>This final piece demonstrates what a cartoonist can achieve when they've mastered perspective. There's overlap everywhere, helping this complex design hold together.</p>

<p><strong>Convergence</strong> is prominent. The vanishing points are outside each panel, but McCay used a straight edge to draw lines accurately toward them.</p>

<p>As for <strong>diminution</strong>, the presence of vanishing points ensures that objects shrink along receding lines. <strong>Rendering</strong> is minimal here, some shading and changes of light on building sides, a bit on the steps and crown, but overall, it's sparingly used.</p>

<p>Comparing this to other works, McCay heavily exploits <strong>rendering</strong> in some panels but leaves it out in others. For example, in pieces with a noir look, rendering plays a significant role. In contrast, Hiroshi Yoshida's work uses <strong>atmospheric perspective</strong> more than rendering. Yoshida's print showcases soft transitions and subtle tones, creating depth without heavy rendering.</p>

<p>When you don't rely on rendering, you achieve a graphic or cartoonish look, a flatter appearance where lines, not shading, create the illusion of depth. While rendering and shading make a drawing more realistic, artists don't always aim for realism. Even when they do, rendering typically comes after establishing the composition with lines. This brings us back to linear perspective and our foundational lessons.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p><strong>Artists use rendering, overlap, diminution, foreshortening, and convergence</strong> to create the illusion of depth. By studying masters like Winsor McCay, you can learn how to apply these techniques to your own work. Remember, when you study drawings, don't just copy, <strong>analyze</strong>. Look for the methods the artist uses, and consider how they enhance the illusion of depth.</p>

<p>This was an overview of the ways we create perspective in art. There's more to come, so stay tuned for future lessons where we'll dive deeper into these concepts.</p>
