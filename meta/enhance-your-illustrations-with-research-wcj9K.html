<h2>Research and Exploration</h2>

<p>I started by creating a fan art piece of <strong>Spirited Away</strong>. Since I hadn't drawn anything for <em>Spirited Away</em> before, I needed to do a lot of research. It was a great excuse to draw the things that inspired me.</p>

<h3>Getting Familiar with Miyazaki's Style</h3>

<p>The next few sketches were me getting familiar with the style of <strong>Miyazaki</strong>, and the way he designs characters. The first drawing I did didn't look good, it wasn't exactly my style or Miyazaki's style. But I soldiered on. The first one didn't go well, so I did another one. Sometimes you need that warm-up stage. The more you draw, the more comfortable you get. Sometimes you start to feel better about it.</p>

<h3>Drawing the Characters</h3>

<p>I focused on pinpointing the parts of Miyazaki's art style that I liked and the characters I might want to feature in the piece. At this point, I had no idea what the end product would be. I drew some characters and costumes that I might not use, but by drawing them, I got a sense of whether they were options I wanted to play with.</p>

<p>I remember really liking <strong>Haku</strong>, the dragon character. I loved the way he looks in the film, so cool, a little bit scary, but not frightening. If there's a feeling you're going for, practice evoking that feeling. Sometimes the exploration and research phase is about capturing the mood you want.</p>

<p>Drawing these characters also reminded me of things I'd forgotten I liked. Maybe this is something I want to draw in the future. I can always refer back to this research for other drawings. They don't all have to be for the next project.</p>

<p>When I drew the final piece, I used my own sketches, I didn't go back to Google Images and scroll through tabs. I had a sketchbook in front of me, and I could pick up and see exactly what the characters looked like. Because I'd drawn them before, I could understand them better without reinterpreting the reference. The filter of your understanding when you take a reference and draw it in a way you understand is really important.</p>

<h2>Thumbnails and Composition</h2>

<p>Next, I worked on thumbnails for the <em>Spirited Away</em> piece.</p>

<h3>Initial Ideas</h3>

<p>The first thumbnail I did was thinking of a horizontal orientation where the main character, <strong>Sen</strong>, is in her sleeveless costume. I thought it would be cool because seeing the muscles is informative and interesting. But the problem was I wanted to include a lot more characters. I had really enjoyed researching so many, and I thought it'd be more fun to include more <strong>Easter eggs</strong>. The size of this shot was just too close up for me to accomplish what I wanted, even though it might have been cute.</p>

<p>This planted an idea that I might use later. Sometimes an idea plants itself, and you can use it for a future piece.</p>

<h3>Developing the Final Composition</h3>

<p>The last series of thumbnails is what I ended up going with. In the initial idea, I didn't draw the character in the angle I wanted, so I sketched her elsewhere on the page. As I was figuring out the pose, I drew on top of it. This series of thumbnails was mostly me figuring out the posing of <strong>Haku</strong> and <strong>Sen</strong> within the piece, but the composition was pretty set.</p>

<p>I wanted the main characters flying over a night market. I'd been to Taiwan recently, and there's this night market called <strong>Raohe Night Market</strong>. When I was there, I had a <em>Spirited Away</em> type of experience. It's like the beginning of the film with amazing food everywhere and a really cool atmosphere. Also, we were there with my wife's parents, and we lost them while we were there, just like at the beginning of the film. We found her dad within ten minutes, but we were searching for her mom for 45 minutes. When we found her, she was eating food at a stall and said, "I just figured it'd be best if I stayed put."</p>

<p>Sometimes this phase of exploration will trigger a memory that inspires you, and you can take it in that direction. Anytime I do a piece, the more of myself I put into it, the more I connect with it, and the more exciting it is for me. That always translates to the viewer, whether the artist is having a good time, whether they have a funny inside joke they want to get across, or whether there's a story at all.</p>

<h2>Line Art and Color Palette</h2>

<h3>Creating the Line Art</h3>

<p>For this piece, I remember just going for it. There's no pencil sketch necessarily. My idea for the overall composition is it looks purely like a <em>Spirited Away</em> piece because that's the main focal point. But my goal artistically was to have an overall <strong>Ghibli</strong> piece. In this night market scene, almost all the major Ghibli characters make an appearance.</p>

<p>My ambition was to create a piece where it feels cohesive but has everything in it at the same time. A lot of times, I've seen other artwork where they try to have all the Ghibli films together, and it looks like a rainbow because all of them have different color palettes that are very iconic. They don't want to touch that. But I wanted to have everything and also bring it together with a really intense color palette.</p>

<p>The composition was that the main characters are very clear, focused, and large, and the rest of them are more of a mosaic. They're more of a texture to the piece. From far away, you won't even notice them, but if you're a super fan and you dig deep, you'd find all those other things.</p>

<h3>Choosing a Cohesive Color Palette</h3>

<p>Next, I did the flats. I'm already thinking about making the color palette really cohesive. For example, on the <strong>Mononoke</strong> character, her shirt might be blue, but instead, I chose the darkest value within my palette to be that color. If a color needs to be a bright blue, I try to squeeze it into the closest next best thing within my palette. That way, I'm not having to have a million different colors.</p>

<p>Similarly, the contrast between the focal point and the background is that she's allowed to be the true-to-life color, because she's going to stand out. Everybody else is this kind of pattern of color, and they all blend together. This is intentional at this stage. So these are flats, there's no lighting or shading yet.</p>

<h2>Shading and Lighting</h2>

<h3>Adding Highlights and Shadows</h3>

<p>Next, I've added shading and light. What I ended up doing was actually just a highlight pass. The light in this case helps unify everything because it dominates. It's almost like half of the bottom area has become that one light that's cohesive.</p>

<p>There's a little bit of a gradient on that light source because within my own personal work, I wanted to move the eye towards the center. Having it brighter in the middle and slightly darker on the edges is what I was playing with. I think when it was just all flat, the corners were a little bit too loud. This is what I was playing with.</p>

<p>There's a little bit of gradation on the hair. I'm starting to hone in on the values for the overall piece, how much I want her to pop out versus blend in with the background. Because this was a little bit stark. Now, things are starting to come together a little bit.</p>

<h2>Finalizing the Piece</h2>

<p>In the final version of the piece, what we see compared to the previous step is a lot more crunching down of the color palette to make it cohesive. I wanted it to be all about the nighttime vibe, the way the night market light is the main highlight source of the piece. When you're in that kind of environment, only things that are directly lit by a light source really pop out. So achieving that atmosphere was the main goal from this step to the final version.</p>

<p>That meant crunching down everything else to be that middle tone purple. The <strong>line art</strong> is really my darkest dark that defines everything else. I was very happy to achieve the look that I wanted where this night market scene feels cohesive, has everybody in it, but from afar looks like a <em>Spirited Away</em> piece.</p>

<p>That wraps up my process for my personal artwork. I hope you've enjoyed seeing how I create an illustration from start to finish.</p>
