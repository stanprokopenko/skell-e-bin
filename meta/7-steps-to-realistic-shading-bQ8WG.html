<p>We have learned all the elements of light and shadow to reveal form. Now it's time to put it into practice.</p>

<p>In this demo, you'll explore all the key elements: how to handle reflected light, model halftones, place highlights, understand occlusion shadows, and even analyze the penumbra of a cast shadow. We'll cover the practical steps for realistic shading using a basic sphere. This is the exact same process you can use when shading anything, even complex subjects like a portrait.</p>

<h2>Draw the Linear Layin</h2>

<p>Start with a linear layin. Map out and design the shapes, establish gesture, perspective, and anatomy. Anything you can solve linearly, do linearly first. In this case, it's just a circle.</p>

<p>One of the main roles of a linear layin is to serve as a bunch of containers and placeholders that inform you where to put your values and colors. They are important. What's the point of shading details in the wrong place or shading a boring shape? Most artists start with a linear layin before they shade.</p>

<h2>Map Out the Form Shadow</h2>

<p>The first and most important thing you need to do is separate the light from the shadow, which happens at the <strong>terminator</strong>. The terminator is where the light rays from the light source just barely skim the surface, and the planes start to face away from the light. Everything on one side of the terminator is in light, everything beyond it falls into shadow.</p>

<p>Identify where the light source is, and then imagine an equator around the ball facing that light direction. In the reference, you don't see the terminator as a sharp line because there is a transition, a soft edge, in both directions from light to shadow. Unless it's a box, then it's a sharp edge. Usually, you'll imagine the terminator and draw the soft edge of the <strong>core shadow</strong>, which usually falls right on the terminator.</p>

<h2>Map Out the Cast Shadow</h2>

<p>Remember, the <strong>cast shadow</strong> is different from the form shadow. Itâ€™s not about the planes facing away from the light source, it's caused by one form blocking light from reaching another. This table surface is actually facing up toward the light, but it's being blocked by the ball.</p>

<p>Cast shadows are a great tool to create a relationship between two objects. They connect them together, like the table and ball, or separate them apart. The higher you lift the ball, the greater the distance between the ball and the cast shadow, which represents the table. Without a cast shadow, the relationship between the table and ball is unclear. It looks like it's floating somewhere above the table.</p>

<p>Cast shadows are also great tools to show the form of either the object casting the shadow or the form of the surface the cast shadow is on, or both. Always try to design your cast shadows to follow cross-contour lines of the form it is cast on.</p>

<h2>Separate Light and Shadow</h2>

<p>Fill in the form shadow with one consistent dark value. Initially, aim for a value dark enough to clearly show the contrast between the light and shadow, but not pure black. You need to save some darker values for the core shadow and occlusion later. The exact value will depend on the lighting, environment, and local value of the object, but typically shoot for a value 3 or 4, on a scale where 1 is white and 10 is black. This value represents the lightest shadow value, the <strong>reflected lights</strong>.</p>

<p>The cast shadow is part of the shadow family, so include it in that same shadow mass.</p>

<h2>Refine the Core Shadow and Reflected Light</h2>

<p>Light doesn't completely stop when it hits an object. Some of it gets absorbed and usually turned into heat, but some of that light bounces off and hits another object. That next object absorbs some of it and bounces the rest again, and again and again, until all the light has been absorbed.</p>

<p>So you have all of this light bouncing around your environment. This means that an object isn't just hit by the light directly from the light source. The shadows will receive some <strong>reflected light</strong>. But remember, reflected light gets weaker every time it bounces, so don't draw it as bright as the direct light. In your ball, for example, light bounces off the table and back up into the shadow.</p>

<p>Don't erase out the reflected light to make it lighter. When you're just starting out, it's too easy to erase too much and make it too light. Sometimes you get so excited about reflected light that you forget that they are shadows! You might end up making them brighter than the halftones. It's better to darken around reflected lights to make sure all the shadows stay within the shadow family. In other words, the reflected light should be <strong>darker than any halftone</strong>. This is really important and it's a very common mistake.</p>

<p>So, instead of erasing out the reflected lights, darken the <strong>core shadow</strong>, usually near the terminator. It's the darkest part of the form shadow, but don't make it pure black. The <strong>occlusion shadow</strong> under the ball, where it touches the surface, is darker. By darkening the core shadow, you inadvertently create reflected light.</p>

<p>But what is the core shadow? Why is it darker? Well, it's actually pretty simple. It's the part of the form shadow that's least affected by reflected light. The surface in this area angles away from both the direct light source and most nearby surfaces bouncing light back onto it. Because it's hidden from both direct and reflected light, it appears darker.</p>

<p>If you add a surface into the environment that does bounce light into that area, the core shadow disappears!</p>

<p>You won't always see a core shadow because it depends on the environment and how the reflected light is hitting the object. Sometimes it's very obvious across the entire terminator, sometimes it's partially visible along a portion of the terminator, and sometimes it's very hard to see.</p>

<h2>Model the Halftones</h2>

<p>Before shading the halftones, imagine the position of the <strong>center light</strong>. Think of it as the spot where the plane of the object points directly toward the light. Once you know where it is, it's easier to correctly place the halftones as they transition toward the shadow. Halftones are still receiving light directly from the light source, but at an angle. The steeper the angle, the darker the value.</p>

<p>Halftones make up most of the lit area, almost the whole thing. And since the lit area is more important than the shadow area, this is where you should spend most of your effort when shading. Consider the precise value at each point, design the shape of each tile or plane, and model the hatch marks around the forms, like cross-contours.</p>

<p>This is where you might make the shading too spotty if you don't have much experience. Don't worry, you'll get better with practice.</p>

<p>If you choose to blend your halftones, be careful not to overblend. Blending is a tool, but you can get dependent on it. For beginners, I recommend practicing hatching and using directional strokes that follow the planes.</p>

<p>One very common mistake with halftones is to make the gradation linear, meaning the transition between the center light and the core shadow consistently gets darker. But that's not how it works. There's something called the <strong>law of diffuse reflection</strong> that describes how we see that transition. We made a great video with Dorian Iten a while back that explains it clearly, so I recommend you watch it.</p>

<p>But generally, most of the transition happens near the terminator. The change in value gets much more subtle as you get closer to the center light. The common mistake of using a linear gradation results in way too much of the dark halftones creeping into the light halftone area. You end up with something like this. So, move those dark halftones closer to the terminator.</p>

<h2>Design the Highlight</h2>

<p>After getting all the halftones in, you can add the <strong>highlight</strong>. You can either erase it out, drawing it with your eraser, or you could have shaded around it during the halftones stage.</p>

<p>Highlights are attention-grabbing, and it's tempting to jump in and add them into your drawings early. But it can be a good idea to save them for last. Your forms should feel solid and three-dimensional without them. You can focus on shading the subtle gradations toward the center light. Highlights are just the finishing touch, the cherry on top.</p>

<p>Highlights often get confused with center lights, but they're not the same thing. A highlight is a reflection of the light source itself. Unlike the center light, the highlight's position depends on the position of the viewer. If you move, the highlight moves too.</p>

<p>It's going to be closer to the core shadow than the center light. As a rule of thumb, as we get more shadow, the highlight gets farther from the center light.</p>

<p>Usually, it's the brightest spot on the form. Different materials interact with light in different ways. Matte surfaces, like rubber or cloth, are microscopically rough, so they scatter light in different directions, creating soft, diffused highlights. Shiny or glossy surfaces, like metals, a clean apple, or even wet skin, are microscopically smooth, so they reflect light more directly like a mirror, creating bright, crisp highlights.</p>

<p>Notice how your ball already looks 3D even with no information in the shadows. You have just one flat value in there. This really shows how most of the illusion of form comes from the careful rendering within the lights and the clear separation between light and shadow. Some artists choose to leave their shadows very simple. It's a stylistic choice, but you don't have to stop here.</p>

<h2>Deepen the Occlusion Shadow</h2>

<p>This is typically the darkest shadow that occurs where very little or no direct light or reflected light can reach. <strong>Occlusion shadows</strong> within the cast shadow ground the object even more to the surface it's on and add to the sense of space. As this cast shadow extends outward, it gradually lightens as the occlusion fades off. This area is exposed to the environment and more reflected light reaches it.</p>

<p>A common misconception is that occlusion shadows only appear within the cast shadow directly under an object. But really, occlusion shadows occur anywhere two surfaces are close enough to block out reflected light. You can see occlusion shadows within cast shadows, form shadows, or even within areas where there would be direct light if the objects weren't touching. Think of how skin folds are tightly pressed together, or a nostril is deep like a cave. A great example is your fingers. When you bring two fingers together, you'll see a dark line between them. The fingers are so close together that they block direct and reflected light from entering that tiny gap. No matter what the lighting conditions are in your room right now, you'll see a shadow in the deep crevice between the fingers. Try it!</p>

<h2>Fade the Penumbra</h2>

<p>So this ellipse is the cast shadow. But what is this thing? That's the <strong>penumbra</strong>! It's technically part of the cast shadow, but it's more of a transition out of the cast shadow.</p>

<p>Think of it like this, the darkest part of the cast shadow, called the <strong>umbra</strong>, is where the ball is completely blocking the light source. If you were an ant standing in the umbra, you would not be able to see the light source at all. But if you were standing in that fuzzy penumbra area, you'd be able to see part of the light source peeking around the edge of the ball. Because some light is reaching this area, but not all of it, it creates this transitional zone, a gradient from the dark umbra out to the fully lit surface.</p>

<p>This happens because most light sources aren't tiny points, they have some size. Even the sun, even though it's really far away, has a visible size. Different points on the light source can illuminate slightly different areas around the object.</p>

<p>So, when you're drawing that cast shadow, don't just give it a hard outline unless the situation calls for it. Pay attention to that soft edge.</p>

<h2>Make Final Adjustments</h2>

<p>Before you call this done, step back and review everything, making sure all the parts are working together correctly. Again, it's really about the relationships between all the values, not any individual spot. Adjust things here and there until you're happy.</p>

<h2>Assignment</h2>

<p>Alright, so your next project is to shade a sphere.</p>

<p>Try to follow along with what I did here. You haven't learned much about edges yet, and to really get that 3D ball effect you have to control your edges really well. Keep that in mind. Don't beat yourself up if you struggle with the transitions. But make sure you get your value relationships right. You have to just jump in and start shading before you have all the information.</p>

<p>So, this lesson is the demonstration. I'll create a dedicated Project lesson where you can submit your drawings. Head over to the next lesson and start the assignment.</p>
