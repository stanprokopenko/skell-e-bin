<p>Welcome back! We often hear me speak of <strong>render hell</strong>. <strong>Gestural hell</strong> and <strong>structural hell</strong> are not far behind. Now, I love gesture, so the hellish nature of it isn't that bad, it's just a wobbly drawing. <strong>Structural hell</strong> is pretty rough because things get stiff.</p>

<p>But let's get into <strong>render heaven</strong>. Why is there render heaven? Is it not always render hell? No, not at all. When you know what you're rendering, it's heaven, and that's what this is all about. We'll end each of these osmosis workshops with render. To get there, we need to understand the shapes underneath, how they link together, how they flow in a beautiful manner, and then rendering is fun. It becomes a beautiful thing to do, and I love it.</p>

<p>We're going to spend more time on this, <strong>an hour and a half for this one</strong>, and we're going to get into the heavenly nature of rendering well, with thought and feeling. We'll look at <strong>edges</strong>, <strong>lost edges</strong>, there's always a fight, but it's a fight worth fighting. Let's get after it, and enjoy ourselves.</p>

<h2>Preparing to Render</h2>

<h3>Tools and Materials</h3>

<p>Here's my little <strong>charcoal piece</strong>. I basically <strong>break charcoal sticks and shave them into a little triangle</strong>. <strong>Two fingers wide</strong> is usually a good size for me, that's a little small because they get better as you use them. I use them right to the end almost.</p>

<p>The great thing about the charcoal piece is that it becomes an <strong>extension of your hand</strong>. You can see how <strong>fluidly I'm moving along</strong> here. It's a much <strong>faster drawing instrument</strong> than any pencil. You're basically drawing with your fingers, it's just that little extension. How great would it be to have fingers that are charcoal ends, to just draw finger paint?</p>

<h3>Preparing Your Surface and Hands</h3>

<p>I like to put a bit of <strong>charcoal on my palms and fingers</strong> and rub it in. It <strong>stops greasy marks</strong>. If you're going to do a rendered drawing, you've got to make sure there's no grease on the surface. I wash my hands and then play with some charcoal, dirtying the hands up just enough to close into those pores some charcoal and dry out the grease a little.</p>

<p>We all have greasy hands, you can't say, "Not me, I don't have greasy hands." There's oil in your hand, and that's a fact. In our advertising days, when we were airbrushing, we'd wipe the illustration board with lighter fluid to remove any marks that had been touched by the people that sold the boards. Once we put that film down, we knew that it wasn't going to pick up any paint when we laid it down with the airbrush.</p>

<p>Another thing is that straight out of the packet, erasers have a lot of gum on them, and that's oily. So get a little bit of dirt, a little bit of charcoal, into that <strong>kneadable eraser</strong> and rub it in, squeeze it. Make sure you do that.</p>

<p>Don't worry about messing up the surface. It just adds to the beauty of it anyway. You'll probably smudge a lot when you begin, but after a while, your hand is so light you won't even notice it.</p>

<h2>Starting the Drawing</h2>

<h3>Introducing the Model and Pose</h3>

<p>So, <strong>Mrs. V</strong>, let's put her in. She's going to rule the show here. This is a <strong>foreshortened pose</strong>, and for most artists beginning, it is one of the hardest things to do. But it's my favorite kind. It's not extremely foreshortened, but enough to cause trouble for the novice, the beginner, for anyone. It's tricky, it's not easy by any means. But look how where we've been has given us the confidence to do this.</p>

<h3>Tackling a Foreshortened Pose</h3>

<p>The <strong>Liberty Bell</strong> is going to give me that shape within the structures to work out how this is going to go because they're no longer the same sizes. For instance, they're close to, but the dominant player here in this foreshortened pose is the <strong>hips</strong>, and they're going to be <strong>bigger than the upper body</strong>.</p>

<p>So I'm pulling across from the bottom of Mrs. V to find the push out of the <strong>greater trochanter</strong> and the top of Mrs. V to find the start of it. Everything's going to work around that. Right away, we've got a <strong>torpedo foreshortened leg</strong> on the right. So I'm finding the bones and following those bones up through the body.</p>

<p>Remember, the <strong>hips are fused</strong>. Doesn't mean the knees follow that, but on this occasion, I'm going through all those broad points. The top and bottom of Mrs. V are definitely fused. I follow those points across to the trochanter.</p>

<h2>Building the Structure</h2>

<h3>Using Basic Shapes</h3>

<p>Once I've established the greater trochanter and the hip shape, you can see we've got a lot done there in a very short time, <strong>three minutes or so</strong>. Now, what I would say is <strong>repeat that over and over on scrap pieces of paper</strong> until you're ready to continue on to this next stage. Just do that over and over.</p>

<p>Finding the <strong>egg shape now inside that tube</strong>. And look at how much <strong>pentimento</strong> we can get out of this charcoal piece. The great thing about it is look how easy it is to <strong>fade back</strong>, way easier than any pencil.</p>

<h3>Flow and Movement</h3>

<p>Another thing is, I don't use mannequins. I think they're <strong>too stiff</strong>. They have brought out a hand now that's very articulate, and if they can bring a mannequin out the same way, it would be great. But for now, those wooden things are just really decoration, nice to have in the studio, but they're too structurally jointed.</p>

<p>I want that <strong>arm to flow all the way down to the longest finger</strong>, for instance, on the outside. Then I'll put in whatever curved joints I need. I'm already plotting out this figure to be more <strong>gestural</strong>, and a good way to do that is to <strong>use the hair</strong>. So if the model has short hair, you don't have to draw short hair, continue that flow all the way through. Once you come off the <strong>crown of the head</strong> like that, you can do anything you want. Nobody's going to critique your hair unless it looks very strange, like a wig.</p>

<h3>Overlapping Forms</h3>

<p>Re-establishing these initial marks that I made and getting a little bit more sophisticated with it, Mrs. V now has got some curve to her, and I'm pulling that leg over because I've established already where the top and bottom of the trochanter are. I can curve that <strong>rectus femoris</strong> over to find it, it's worked really well.</p>

<p>Coming up to the <strong>iliac crest</strong> to put in that <strong>sartorius line</strong>, and you can see that tubular leg is already starting to look more fleshy for that reason. Now, from this angle, this is where things get tricky. The abdominals are pushing up and out and back in again, and they are hiding a little bit of the <strong>hip crest</strong> on the outside of the form. And that's natural. I used to try and put the hip crest in, I thought it needed to be there, and realized that it's hidden behind these rolling hills that we've enjoyed drawing so many times in a smaller, less complicated manner.</p>

<p>We've got two things to deal with. We're going to render this, this is our <strong>dessert</strong> for all of the good stuff we did. Now you can see how <strong>overlapping forms</strong> work. You can see the hips are overlapping the back there, and finding that <strong>oblique</strong> pushing up. Because the obliques don't end at the hip, and they don't end at the ribcage, they carry on up through the ribcage. That's why we see a little hook there. So, there's more to it than first meets the eye.</p>

<h2>Developing the Gesture</h2>

<h3>Don't Rush the Details</h3>

<p>Don't do the <strong>hand too soon</strong>, is my advice, because you'll get bogged down in it, and then you'll not be gestural. Come back and forth on a little sortie here and there to find it, but the main thing is that <strong>carpal ramp</strong> down to the longest finger, and then the <strong>thenar eminence</strong> is not being shown here, you've only got to deal with that <strong>thenar</strong> of the thumb.</p>

<h3>Using the Charcoal Piece Effectively</h3>

<p>Getting in close, that little triangular shape is very square on the outside, and so when you <strong>shave it down onto a block of sandpaper</strong>, it naturally has a <strong>blade edge</strong> to it. And that's what I use, I tip it up on its edge to get those shapes. This takes a lot of practice. So make those little <strong>triangle shapes</strong> just like the pyramids, think of it like that, and what happens is you work on the sharp edges. They become more blunt, and they become something you can work with a broad stroke on.</p>

<p>To expedite that, I'll often take one edge and shave it a little bit as well so it has a broader edge than the other edge. So <strong>know what edge you're working with</strong> too. And as they get more and more blunt, just pick up another one. You should have about <strong>six of these</strong> in your little box of tricks.</p>

<h3>Maintaining Lightness</h3>

<p>I just use my finger there as well, just to <strong>soften a line</strong> that was not quite what I wanted. A lot of <strong>pentimento</strong> here with much softer, broader lines. I'm very aware of the complications of this head pulled back, that's another thing you could do on the side of the sheet. I'm just going full steam ahead here for this demo. But you've seen the old masters, if something's tricky, they'll do a <strong>study on the side</strong>, not necessarily on the canvas, that's for demos, but they'll have little small canvases that they'll work on, or paper that they'll draw a hand, usually a hand on, or a head.</p>

<h2>Rendering Techniques</h2>

<h3>Edges and Lost Edges</h3>

<p>Now, the great thing about the charcoal piece is that it becomes an extension of your hand. We're getting into <strong>render hell</strong> here, but when you know what you're doing, it's <strong>render heaven</strong>. We'll look at <strong>edges</strong> and <strong>lost edges</strong>, there's always a fight. We'll talk about that, but it's the fight worth fighting. Let's get after it, and enjoy ourselves.</p>

<h3>Adjusting Tones and Values</h3>

<p>I'm basically putting down a lot of <strong>mid-tone</strong> that I will need later to raise into. Thinking ahead, when I'm doing a charcoal drawing like this for render, it's very similar to <strong>oil painting</strong> in that I have to think ahead to how things will <strong>blend later</strong>. And although we don't have the problem of the charcoal getting sticky like oil does, and so there's a time limit on oils, I still want to leave this open as long as I can before I bring the pencil in.</p>

<h3>Choosing the Right Tools</h3>

<p>For this drawing, I'm using a <strong>General's charcoal pencil</strong>. The best pencil you can possibly get for this, for my drawing style anyway, is this little <strong>soft General's</strong>. It's a problem because it <strong>breaks so much</strong>, so I've sort of gravitated to a <strong>medium one</strong>. You get a medium hard or a soft in these <strong>Peel and Sketch pencils</strong>. The soft is the best, but sometimes you get a whole pack, and they're all broken through. So I've stopped really buying the soft ones, and use the medium ones now. But I still have some soft ones that are good ones, and I'll pull them out when I need.</p>

<p>I don't use <strong>fixative</strong>. I only fix a drawing when it's finished. You could use a reworkable fixative here if you feel like you're never going to get this back again, and that will hold the pencil. It won't completely hold it, but the reworkable fixative for me is better because at least you can still erase into it.</p>

<h3>Softening and Blending</h3>

<p>I'm starting to feel the <strong>indelible stuff</strong>, all that stuff that I put in earlier disappeared now, hasn't it? But it was worth putting in because I can push in now to that greater trochanter, to where Mrs. V took me, and pull around it as well for the hips going up.</p>

<p>Now, with the pencil done, what happens is that I can <strong>move the charcoal from the pencil about</strong>, and it still retains a little bit of the line. Do you see that? It'll get rid of the charcoal marks that we made earlier if I push long and hard enough, but the pencils retain their initial marks as ghosts, and that's the great thing about starting with a charcoal piece. It can eventually just disappear altogether, so you don't see the mechanics that you would if you put pencil structure down.</p>

<p>I bring the <strong>chamois</strong> in, now, this is a dirty chamois, so it takes away less because I'm playing very subtle games here. Pulling those <strong>ribs</strong> and <strong>serratus</strong> out. So basically, <strong>drawing negatively</strong> here. And that's another thing that echoes into oil paint. I'll often use the rag to do this in oil painting, and you get a lot done very quickly. A brush would take a long time to do the same.</p>

<h3>Reflections on Mediums</h3>

<p>This is the way to prep yourself for an <strong>oil painting</strong> because you're really working with <strong>dry oils</strong> here, in my mind anyway. You do exactly what oils do. Consider this a brush that has a hard edge on it, and the length of it will give me all the joy of a brush.</p>

<p>When it comes to oil painting, you've got <strong>filberts</strong>, you've got <strong>flats</strong>, you've got <strong>rounds</strong>, and you've got <strong>brights</strong>, and they're all great for what they do. We'll call this a bright, which has got a round kind of feel to it. So I'm working mostly with a bright here in oil terms. It gives us softer forms.</p>

<p>I love <strong>oils</strong>, it's the <strong>king of paints</strong> for me. It can do everything that watercolor can do, and acrylic can do. It can't do watercolor as beautifully as watercolor, but it can thin down like watercolor. So watercolor has a place in my heart too, it's a beauty. <strong>Acrylic</strong>, not so much. It's just basically a dumb, for me anyway, a dumb kind of oils. You can't <strong>blend it at all</strong>. Very good for abstract work, very good for every blade of grass, but you can't really blend with it.</p>

<p>They have long-working ones too, I've tried them out, but they can't hold a candle to oils. Hopefully one day. The longevity of acrylics has come into question recently. It's just horse paint, and they are finding that in the Metropolitan Museum, some of Andy Warhol's paintings are <strong>falling apart</strong>. This thing that was supposed to last forever, acrylics, is showing its wear and tear.</p>

<p>One of the earliest oil paintings I ever did from my early twenties, I took it off the wall the other day because a student said to me, "Have you got any old stuff?" It's as fresh as ever. It's lost none of its wonder. So the king of paints, the longevity has been proven.</p>

<h2>Incorporating Emotion and Narrative</h2>

<h3>Adding Themes to Your Drawing</h3>

<p>This is our <strong>dessert</strong>, remember, we've had all of those little digestible, let's call them dinners, and now we've got a big dessert here. We can put all that into action, and render. But remember, with real desserts, if you have one dessert after another, you're going to be sick. So this is to be <strong>earned</strong>, and I'll end every little workshop with a render to show you what can be done, and inspire you in your journey forward.</p>

<p>I'm thinking abstract, I'm not thinking about a big queen-like robe. I already have an idea in mind here that <strong>this is an exhausted queen</strong> that has <strong>laid down after fleeing from the enemy</strong> to have a moment of respite in a safe place, and she's exhausted. It's a very simple story, but it's enough for me to get in there. So the <strong>theme is anguish</strong>, and we have in there lots of allegory, if you like, as well. We can say that love conquers all and that you will get through this, but this could also mean that despair has taken over the emotion that she originally had.</p>

<h3>Building a Story Around the Figure</h3>

<p>You can write anything into this, you can even write into this idea that she's ecstatic about finally being in this safe place. So there is a million ways to write this story. But give it something, let's give it a theme. I'm gonna say the theme here is <strong>anguish</strong>. We'll go with that. And she is safe for a moment, and she's exhausted, and that's what we have right here, up there on that pinnacle of a hill.</p>

<p>Now, this abstract cloth, let's say it's her big gown, her giant cape. I can make that bigger and bigger, it doesn't matter. No one's going to question it. What I want to do is kill the nastiness of that long leg, break it up a little bit because it looked a little loopy with something more solid. When something gets too gestural and out of control, we need a little bit of structure in there.</p>

<h3>Evolving the Narrative</h3>

<p>We can explore further characters in different parts of the world in different drawings and paintings. This one is your classic kind of <strong>Disney princess</strong> with a realistic turn to it. So kinda, let's think about <strong>Snow White</strong> maybe, but more grown up. Maybe Snow White escaped the valley of the dwarfs where they were evil, rewrite the story. Maybe they're chasing her. There you go, that's taking a genre and flipping it. The <strong>evil dwarfs</strong>, and Snow White was duped by them, it turns out. You can do that, you can have any story as you go along.</p>

<p>When you're doing a big render like this, you've got all the time in the world to contemplate the <strong>story and narrative</strong>, and change it. <strong>Anguish</strong> can be transported into a different character, that's just the theme. The theme is <strong>anguish</strong>, and then you can write a story. We don't really have a story, we just have a theme.</p>

<h2>Overcoming Challenges</h2>

<h3>Dealing with Difficult Areas</h3>

<p>Now here's one of the most beautiful things, the <strong>navel from the corner</strong> here. These little moments, these are my <strong>beauty moments</strong>. I'm going in here to explore the beauty of flesh, indirect and with itself. And all those straights and curves that come from that. If something's too curved, I want to put a straight in there to show the <strong>bones exist</strong>. It's not just this yellow figure. Of course, the <strong>hand and the face are mostly all bone</strong>. So what I'll do there is try and put as much <strong>gesture</strong> in as I can, otherwise, it'll look like stick fingers.</p>

<h3>Avoiding Clichés</h3>

<p>We're benefitting more as we go along with different ideas. That head is much more dimensional because of what I've just done. But it is more bombastic now. <strong>The romance dies with detail</strong>. So the more detail there is, the more we're spelling out that this is reality, and it has killed for me the romance of this <strong>martyrdom</strong>. That's such a powerful theme. We've discussed it.</p>

<p>I'm working through this to find something, and by the end of this, you can have a title. You can start with a title - that's a good start, but don't be bound by it. If you start with the title <strong>Martyr</strong> , you might go into the corny territory of martyr too soon. We've all seen it, the soldier holding their comrade, shot, in wide into the sky, you know. It's been done a million times, so you could call that a <strong>cliché</strong> now.</p>

<p>So <strong>study long and hard all that's been done before</strong>, and you've got more chance of being unique, ironically.</p>

<h3>Finding Inspiration</h3>

<p>We can even consider the idea that she's <strong>levitating</strong>, that she's <strong>ascending to a higher plane</strong>, let's say <strong>Valhalla</strong>. So you can see that I had a story of anguish, and it has turned into <strong>martyrdom</strong> now, which is another powerful theme, the theme of the martyr. You can see how that's endured throughout history, with religious stories often of <strong>martyrs</strong> that give their lives for the greater good.</p>

<h2>Final Touches</h2>

<h3>Emphasizing Important Areas</h3>

<p>So these are the <strong>final strokes</strong>. But this can go on for ten minutes, which is what it's going to do. I do this to really push it to the point where, is there any more left to do? But let's look at the wins that are happening here. It's a different kind of drawing than when I preferred to leave it, but it has interesting things that weren't in that drawing. It's a different beast.</p>

<p>One of the big triumphs there for me is the really <strong>heavy lines on the hip and at Mrs. V</strong> to show that beautiful <strong>pentimento</strong> and life of different strokes being changed. We also had a little error there on the leg, but I like it. Those things, they don't happen unless you <strong>explore the situation</strong>.</p>

<h3>Using Erasers and Highlights</h3>

<p>I bring the <strong>kneadable eraser</strong> in now. I'm <strong>sculpting</strong> with this kneadable eraser. As things get more finessed, it loses the power of the abstract, let's call them brush strokes, for instance, which I love so much. So I'm going in here with the kneadable eraser, bringing some of that <strong>painterly feel</strong> back in.</p>

<p>You can see I'm always using the <strong>analogy of paint and charcoal</strong>, they're so similar to me. So we're benefiting more as we go along with different ideas.</p>

<p>You can see how easy it is to get the idea of <strong>metal on flesh</strong>. Basically, you're just taking what's already in the flesh, the <strong>highlights and the corners</strong>, and making them <strong>harder and brighter</strong>. A brighter, harder highlight and a darker, harder occlusion shadow, and that's it. <strong>That's the philosophy</strong>.</p>

<p>That's why I don't like to put jewelry on a figure Here are the breasts, I can continue the flow and gesture of that breast in an ornamental way, which could never be achieved by buying a breastplate like that. They're always clunky, even Hollywood can't do it. But imagine jewelry that is designed to the <strong>shape of your body as you move</strong>, imagine that! That's what I'm doing here.</p>

<h2>Never Stop Learning</h2>

<p>Lots of drawings were done before this, I didn't just start this drawing as a render. I did a lot of <strong>small drawings beforehand</strong>, and then got into this. I usually do a drawing that is a <strong>schematic of this</strong>, and then I do it again to get this flow. But after a while, you can get in there, dander, boots, and all.</p>

<p><strong>Through the power of osmosis</strong>, you will get better and better and better, and that's what I guarantee with all my courses, that you will be a better artist by the end than you were at the start. <strong>That is my guarantee</strong>.</p>

<p>The <strong>more you do, the stronger you get</strong>, there's no doubt about that. You're always a better artist with every stroke you make. The only way not to be is to <strong>stop drawing</strong>. So you <strong>never graduate from drawing</strong>. I know a lot of students and artists that go to college, they learn how to draw so they can paint, and they never draw again, just paint, which is a disastrous idea in my mind because their skills are wasting away when they could be using them to paint better.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p>I hope these movies have been of great value for you. They're of great value to me too. To have to teach it and reiterate it is making my internal art engine way stronger again. The more you do, the stronger you get.</p>

<p>Through the power of osmosis, you will get better and better and better, and that's what I guarantee with all my courses, that you will be a better artist by the end than you were at the start. <strong>That is my guarantee</strong>.</p>

<p>I wish you the best of luck with it. Until next time, <strong>good luck with your art</strong>!</p>
