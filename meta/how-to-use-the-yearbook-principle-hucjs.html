<p>In our art discussions, I like to introduce 'sidebars,' brief discussions that enhance our understanding of key concepts. One such concept is the <strong>"yearbook principle,"</strong> which I learned in art school. This principle focuses on capturing the essence of a subject, especially in portrait drawing.</p>

<h2>The Yearbook Principle</h2>

<p>The yearbook principle is all about capturing the essence of a subject. I first encountered this idea in art school, and it has stuck with me ever since. To illustrate this, I often refer to my high school yearbook, which I illustrated with a jungle theme using watercolor and pen and ink. The principle is about recognizing the faces of classmates, even after decades, by focusing on their essence rather than intricate details.</p>

<h2>Recognizing Faces and Capturing Essence</h2>

<p>Recognizing people is more about the overall shape and silhouette, rather than the fine details like eyelashes or nostrils. This principle suggests that we should focus on the big shapes and overall likeness. It's not just applicable to drawing people, it works for animals and other subjects too. The key is to capture the essence of a person by observing the shape of their head, and how their hair frames their face.</p>

<h2>Techniques for Capturing Essence</h2>

<p>One effective technique for capturing essence is <strong>squinting.</strong> Squinting helps simplify and focus on essential shapes and contrasts by eliminating unnecessary details. This allows us to concentrate on the basic light and shadow, which are crucial for capturing the essence of the subject.</p>

<h2>Importance of Light and Shadow</h2>

<p>Accurately placing darks and lights is vital to achieving a likeness. The yearbook principle emphasizes getting the basic light and shadow right, which makes other details fall into place naturally. It's important to avoid overemphasizing details and instead focus on the overall shapes and placement of darks.</p>

<h2>Refining the Drawing</h2>

<p>Even when painting, I encourage refining the drawing. Maintaining accuracy in shapes and placement is crucial. The goal is to achieve a solid feel in the artwork by capturing the essence and accurately placing important elements. Once the essence is captured, additional details like halftones and edges are like icing on the cake.</p>

<p>The yearbook principle is about capturing the essence and likeness of the subject. By focusing on the overall shapes and accurately placing lights and darks, we can achieve a strong likeness. Remember, the additional details are just enhancements. The most important thing is to get the drawing right.</p>
