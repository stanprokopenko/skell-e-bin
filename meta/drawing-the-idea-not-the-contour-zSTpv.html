<p>Gesture drawing is often a nebulous, ambiguous concept. Many artists discuss it differently, and sometimes we're under pressure to create gestures quickly. This can lead to frantic scribbling, without much purpose. But gesture drawing is essential, it is the foundation of our drawings that we build upon. In this article, I'll break down gesture drawing into three key components, helping you understand and apply it more effectively.</p>

<h2>Breaking Down Gesture Drawing</h2>

<p>I like to organize gesture drawing into three categories:</p>

<ol>

<li><strong>Why am I doing it?</strong></li>

<li><strong>What am I drawing?</strong></li>

<li><strong>How will I achieve the look I want?</strong></li>

</ol>

<p>These are fundamental questions in any visual pursuit. Understanding them will help you develop your own approach to gesture drawing.</p>

<h3>Why Do We Make Gesture Drawings?</h3>

<p>The first and sometimes hardest question to answer is <strong>why</strong> we are making a gesture drawing. For me, it's about conveying an initial idea or story through the figure. This aspect is highly subjective and personal, it's about what you see and how you want to communicate it to your audience.</p>

<h4>The Importance of Abstraction</h4>

<p>To convey an idea effectively, I find abstraction incredibly useful. Abstraction means distilling something down to its essence, removing unnecessary details. For example, the Renaissance's Vitruvian Man by Leonardo da Vinci symbolizes the harmony between the divine and the earthly through geometric shapes, a circle and a square, combined with the human figure. This abstraction communicates complex ideas in a simple way.</p>

<h4>Examples from Art History</h4>

<p>Many artists have used abstraction to convey ideas in gesture drawing:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Andrew Loomis</strong> emphasized the <strong>line of beauty</strong> and rhythm in his drawings, focusing on conveying beauty through abstract lines.</li>

<li><strong>William Hogarth</strong> discussed the <strong>serpentine line</strong>, which moves the eye and creates a sense of movement and anticipation.</li>

<li><strong>Nathan Cabot Hale</strong> described the curved line as <strong>delightful</strong> and <strong>pleasurable</strong> to the eye.</li>

<li><strong>Glenn Vilppu</strong> used asymmetrical, offset curves to create rhythm and movement in his figures.</li>

</ul>

<p>Even <strong>Disney animators</strong> incorporated these concepts, using fluid forms and active potential to create appealing characters.</p>

<h3>Understanding Gesture Through Shape and Line</h3>

<p>Gesture drawing isn't just about copying what we see, it's about expressing ideas through the simplest means, <strong>lines</strong> and <strong>shapes</strong> like curves, straights, S-curves, spheres, boxes, and cones.</p>

<h4>The Line of Beauty and Rhythm</h4>

<p>The <strong>line of beauty</strong>, often an S-curve or asymmetrical line, brings rhythm and movement to a drawing. It's a concept that connects the works of Hogarth, Loomis, and many others. This line delights the eye and conveys a sense of grace and fluidity.</p>

<h4>Use of Shapes in Character Design</h4>

<p>Shapes play a crucial role in how we perceive characters:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Heroes</strong> are often represented by <strong>squares</strong>, symbolizing stability and strength.</li>

<li><strong>Heroines</strong> are associated with <strong>curves</strong>, representing grace and beauty.</li>

<li><strong>Villains</strong> may be depicted with <strong>sharp angles and triangles</strong>, suggesting danger and aggression.</li>

<li><strong>Brutes</strong> might have a <strong>top-heavy shape</strong>, conveying weight and an imposing presence.</li>

<li><strong>Sidekicks</strong> often have a <strong>lower center of gravity</strong>, symbolizing support and approachability.</li>

</ul>

<p>By abstracting characters into shapes, we immediately communicate their essence without relying on details.</p>

<h3>Non-Verbal Communication and Body Language</h3>

<p>Gesture drawing captures the <strong>non-verbal communication</strong> of the body, our poses, movements, and expressions that convey mood and character. Whether it's a confident stance or subtle gestures, these elements tell a story.</p>

<p>For example, how we use our hands can indicate comfort or discomfort:</p>

<ul>

<li>Gesturing within a comfortable zone near the body expresses openness.</li>

<li>Crossing arms might indicate defensiveness or stiffness.</li>

<li>Exaggerated movements above the head can convey excitement or alarm.</li>

</ul>

<p>By focusing on these aspects, we can capture the essence of a figure in our gesture drawings.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p>Gesture drawing is about connecting with your idea, and organizing your thoughts using the simplest means. It's not about drawing the contours or copying exactly what you see, it's about expressing an idea, a story, or a feeling through abstraction. Remember, it's impossible to draw exactly what you see because you're always interpreting and filtering it through your own perceptions.</p>

<p>When I draw, I focus on these ideas rather than getting caught up in details. By understanding <strong>why</strong> we're drawing, what we're drawing, and how we'll achieve it, we can create gesture drawings that are expressive, intentional, and truly our own.</p>
