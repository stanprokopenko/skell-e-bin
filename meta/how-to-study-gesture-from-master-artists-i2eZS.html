<h2>Analyzing Gesture from Master Artists</h2>

<p>I started by studying gestures from master images. On one side, I looked at historical figures like <strong>Michelangelo</strong>, <strong>Peter Paul Rubens</strong>, and <strong>Rodin</strong>. On the other side, I explored works by artists whose drawings I'm really engaged with.</p>

<p>When I examine master drawings like those of Michelangelo, I appreciate how he repositions or reposes his figures. For example, why is one forearm drawn slightly more extended than the other? I notice details, like how he emphasizes a calf muscle or adjusts a foot's angle. These observations are all part of understanding <strong>gesture</strong>, the story, posing, and body language.</p>

<h2>Applying Gesture Lines</h2>

<p>I use the same lines we've learned to think about these positions. Starting with the <strong>cervical</strong>, then the <strong>thoracic</strong>, I follow the spine's natural curves. I observe how the rib cage might lean toward us or how there's a pinch in the obliques as the hip raises. I still use my four lines to represent the spine, moving down into the pelvis and considering where the weight is placed.</p>

<h2>Learning from Comics Artists</h2>

<p>Switching gears, I also study artists like <strong>Rob Liefeld</strong>, known for his work on Deadpool. It's fun to mix it up and see what I can learn from different styles. Comics often emphasize <strong>excessive foreshortening</strong> and <strong>collapsed spaces</strong>. They use more <strong>diagonals</strong> to create excitement and action.</p>

<p>In Liefeld's work, I notice how the neck might be shorter, or how the figure's rib cage twists. I adjust my gesture lines accordingly, making them shorter or changing the wrapping lines to indicate foreshortening.</p>

<h2>Inventing Gestures from Imagination</h2>

<p>One effective way to practice is by drawing the same pose from a different angle. For instance, after studying Deadpool's pose, I might try to draw him jumping away from us. I start with the head, then the cervical spine, shoulders, and thoracic spine, adjusting the pelvis and limbs to match the new perspective.</p>

<p>This approach helps me get comfortable with invention and builds confidence in drawing from imagination.</p>

<h2>Personalizing My Approach</h2>

<p>I also reflect on what I like and what I might do differently. Everyone has unique interests, and the lessons we take will vary. For example, in comics, characters often have high shoulders and low heads to appear more powerful or intimidating. Noticing these trends allows me to decide whether to incorporate them into my own work.</p>

<h2>Observing Composition and Action</h2>

<p>I pay attention to how action is conveyed through gesture and composition. In comics, cropping and framing can break the boundaries of the page, creating a sense of immersion. I think about how the body language and gesture support the action being depicted, such as a character throwing a punch.</p>

<p>If I feel that the action could be communicated more effectively, I experiment by adjusting the pose. Maybe I broaden the stance or change the angle of the limbs to enhance the sense of movement.</p>

<h2>Practicing Inventing Poses</h2>

<p>Finally, I begin inventing gestures to express my own ideas. I might take inspiration from a studied pose but alter it to better convey the story or action I want. This process involves experimentation and personal expression, building on the foundations learned from studying master artists.</p>
