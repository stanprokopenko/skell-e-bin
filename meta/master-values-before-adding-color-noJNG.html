<h2>Starting with Local Colors</h2>

<p>I'm excited to begin adding some local colors and values to our piece. I'm using a tool called the <strong>Filthy Plugin</strong>, which my good friend Francis and I developed for Photoshop. It's a speed-up tool that simplifies some tasks, but if you don't have it, no worries! You can use the lasso tool and fill your selections with the paint bucket tool, just as effectively.</p>

<p>First, I turn on the Filthy Plugin and start by getting a shape of the whole drawing. I want to establish the <strong>local values</strong> by starting with a lighter color for the face. Then, I create a different shape for the hair, encapsulating most of it. I also add in the shoulder and the eye to differentiate those areas.</p>

<h2>Adjusting the Drawing</h2>

<p>After laying down the flats, I often notice areas that need tweaking. Keeping layers separate allows me to go back and make adjustments. I might lower the forehead, give more attitude to the nose, or push the mouth out slightly. Using the Filthy Plugin, I can easily erase or add sections, refining the shapes to my liking.</p>

<h2>Using Multiply Layers for Lights and Darks</h2>

<p>Next, I add a <strong>multiply layer</strong> on top of everything, which starts separating lights and darks. I imagine a top-down lighting scenario, where the light is coming from above. To enhance contrast, I add something in the background, usually a darker value, to make the subject pop.</p>

<p>With the light source in mind, I use the plugin to map out where the shadows would naturally fall:</p>

<ul>

<li>The ear casting a shadow</li>

<li>The top lip being darker due to overhead light</li>

<li>The nose casting a slight shadow</li>

</ul>

<p>At this point, I stop relying on the reference and let the shapes I've established guide me. This approach provides freedom while keeping the piece grounded in reality.</p>

<h2>Leveraging Clipping Masks</h2>

<p>To keep my painting within the lines, I use <strong>clipping masks</strong>. By holding <strong>Alt</strong> and clicking between layers, I ensure that any painting stays within the confines of the base shape. This method allows me to stack multiple layers and maintain clean edges.</p>

<p>For instance, when adding shadows to the skin layer, I create a multiply layer clipped to the skin. This keeps shadows only where they should be, like under the hairline or beneath the lips.</p>

<h2>Refining Shadow Shapes</h2>

<p>Using the lasso tool, I define shadow shapes, focusing on:</p>

<ul>

<li>The cast shadow of the hair on the face</li>

<li>Shadows under the chin</li>

<li>The larger shadow shapes in the hair</li>

</ul>

<p>These initial shapes don't need to be perfect. I know from experience that they'll evolve as I continue working. The key is to establish a solid foundation of values to build upon.</p>

<h2>Embracing the Process</h2>

<p>It's important to have fun with the process. I've spent too many years stressed about drawing, but I've realized that stressing doesn't help. If you're feeling anxious about your work, know that it will pass. Allow yourself the freedom to explore and make mistakes.</p>

<h2>Merging and Adjusting Layers</h2>

<p>Once I'm satisfied with the initial values, I group and duplicate my layers, then merge them into one. This allows me to make broader adjustments, like shifting features to change the expression or altering the silhouette for more attitude.</p>

<p>Remember, <strong>nothing is set in stone</strong>. I'm willing to change anything at any time, which keeps the process less stressful and more enjoyable.</p>

<h2>Focusing on Gradients and Values</h2>

<p>I pay close attention to gradients, especially in areas where the light transitions to shadow. For example, the light hitting the forehead and falling off down the cheek. I use the lasso tool and soft brushes to create subtle transitions that suggest form.</p>

<p>I also refine the values by:</p>

<ul>

<li>Cleaning up edges for solid shapes</li>

<li>Using alpha lock to draw within shapes and adjust colors</li>

<li>Adding occlusion shadows for depth</li>

</ul>

<h2>Preparing for Colorization</h2>

<p>With the grayscale values refined, I'm nearly ready to add color. The plan is to colorize the values using layer modes like <strong>Color</strong>, <strong>Multiply</strong>, <strong>Color Dodge</strong>, and <strong>Overlay</strong>. This method preserves the value structure while introducing color, making the transition smooth.</p>

<p>Before moving on, I ensure that:</p>

<ul>

<li>The values are tied together cohesively</li>

<li>The focal point is well-defined</li>

<li>The background complements the subject</li>

</ul>

<h2>Encouragement and Mindset</h2>

<p>There was a time when I would stop before adding color, but I want to encourage you to push forward. Working from black and white to color can be intimidating, but with practice it becomes a powerful technique. Remember, <strong>color is heavily dependent on underlying values</strong>, a concept that will become clearer as you progress.</p>

<h2>Final Touches Before Color</h2>

<p>I spend time refining the hair by:</p>

<ul>

<li>Adding darker values to push it back</li>

<li>Creating texture with the lasso tool</li>

<li>Introducing strands and flyaway hairs for character</li>

</ul>

<p>I also adjust the lighting to enhance the mood, maybe darkening the background or adding subtle gradients to focus attention on the face.</p>

<h2>Moving Forward</h2>

<p>Now that we've laid a solid foundation in grayscale, we're ready to move on to the colorization phase. We'll use our established values to inform our color choices, ensuring that the piece remains cohesive and grounded.</p>

<p>I'm excited to share this process with you and hope it gives you the confidence to experiment with grayscale to color methods in your own work.</p>
