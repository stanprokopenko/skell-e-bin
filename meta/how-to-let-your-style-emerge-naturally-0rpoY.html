<p>I've been thinking a lot about what it means to find your own artistic style and process. It's a journey that takes time and patience, and along the way, we often feel lost or unsure. But over time, we start to figure out what works for us, and our approach becomes more refined.</p>

<h2>Discovering Your Process</h2>

<p>When I look back at my early years, I seemed so lost. My process was random, and I often wondered how I managed to create anything that looked reasonable. Nowadays, I have a more formulaic approach. I might have three or four workflows that I generally use, but there's less guesswork involved.</p>

<p>If you don't feel like you have a consistent process right now, <strong>don't worry</strong>. That will get figured out over time. Start simple and work towards more complexity. Begin with the broad strokes, and get to the details later. Funny enough, if you do it right, some of the details won't even matter, you can be suggestive about stuff, and that can be more powerful.</p>

<h2>The Importance of Enjoying the Process</h2>

<p>A lot of people say that most of the work of being an artist is <strong>finding the thing that you're willing to do</strong>. There's always a more efficient way of getting a better painting or a better job, but it's ultimately about what part of the process you enjoy. You're making art because you love it, so it's better to find something that you're more interested in than just focusing on efficiency.</p>

<p>If you love something, you're definitely going to have a better quality level with it. The steps to get there should also be enjoyable. I've seen folks who burned out or switched careers because they struggled with <strong>falling in love with the process</strong>. They loved the end result, but the route to get there was brutal for them.</p>

<h2>Falling in Love with the Process</h2>

<p>It takes time to figure out what your favorite process is. Once you figure that out, going from point A to point B doesn't feel as difficult. It's like a well-oiled machine that you're working towards. Even if certain tools or techniques might make your process more efficient technically, they might not be as fun.</p>

<p>For example, using 3D might be more efficient for some, but for me, it adds time into parts of the process that I don't enjoy. You might be shifting emphasis and spending more time on things you don't like. So, it's essential to assess how you're doing things and find what makes the process enjoyable for you.</p>

<h2>Simplifying Your Approach</h2>

<p>Recording yourself while making art can be <strong>super helpful</strong>. Just like athletes watch recordings to improve their techniques, watching yourself work can help you identify areas where you can improve or streamline your process. You might discover that you're spending a significant amount of time on tasks that could be made more efficient.</p>

<p>For instance, I realized I was spending a lot of time manually coloring areas. By creating a simple action in Photoshop to fill in colors, I saved a lot of time and made the process more enjoyable. Small changes like this can add up and make a big difference in your workflow.</p>

<h2>Embracing Your Style</h2>

<p>Your style is almost the <strong>uncontrolled part of your process</strong>. It's the stuff that you're not actively thinking about, the thing that your art will always have, as hard as you fight against it. You can't overthink that stuff. Just let it be. It's fine.</p>

<p>People might tell me they can recognize my work, and at first, it sounded weird or scary. But you can't obsess too much about it. Unless there's a very specific look you're trying to develop for a project, your style will develop organically. So, <strong>don't overthink it</strong>.</p>

<h2>Dealing with Criticism and Comparison</h2>

<p>I think it's important <strong>not to be judgmental</strong> of the decisions you're making as you're making them. Especially when drawing representationally, we often compare ourselves to others and critique every part of our own process. But it's impossible to be creative if you're constantly worrying about how others perceive your work.</p>

<p>You're doing this art for yourself, to love the process as much as you can. At a certain point, if you're doing it professionally, you have to consider other people's definitions of good art. But you have to figure out how to deal with that emotionally. Remember that when you're not chosen for a position, it doesn't necessarily say anything about your skill level. Often, it comes down to a <strong>stylistic mismatch</strong>.</p>

<h2>Using Reference Materials Wisely</h2>

<p>Gathering and looking at <strong>too much reference</strong> at the same time can be counterproductive. You might start with a big mood board, but when you're creating a design or a thumbnail, limit your inputs. Think about the <strong>fewest amount of references</strong> you need to make something unique. Sometimes, just mashing up two ideas can be fun and effective.</p>

<p>My suggestion with reference is to start broad but then narrow it down when you're creating. That way, you can focus and make the process more enjoyable.</p>

<h2>Staying Motivated and Dealing with Rejection</h2>

<p>Social media can be helpful as a <strong>journal of your progress</strong>. If you use it for yourself rather than for reactions, it can motivate you to create more. But remember, <strong>growth is slow and steady</strong>. Look at your work from a year ago or more to see how far you've come.</p>

<p>Don't tie your self-worth to how your art is received. There are always things <strong>out of your control</strong>. Rejection doesn't mean you suck. There are many variables at play, and often it has nothing to do with your skill level.</p>

<h2>The Importance of Personal Projects</h2>

<p>Regardless of where you're employed, it's essential to have your own <strong>personal projects</strong>. It's a sanity thing. You need to feel like you have a sandbox with no rules or rules you fully define. Whether it's a solo project or with friends, it's a good creative outlet that keeps you engaged and excited.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p>Finding your artistic style and process is a journey. It takes time, patience, and a willingness to explore and enjoy the process. <strong>Don't overthink it</strong>, don't compare yourself harshly to others, and focus on what makes you excited to create. Embrace your style, stay motivated, and keep creating.</p>
