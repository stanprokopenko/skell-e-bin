<p>Hi everybody, welcome to the critique on <strong>Arrows in Every Direction</strong>. Look at what we have here with the usual submissions, the great treasure trove of participation from y'all. Let's dive in and see what you've been working on.</p>

<h2>Josh Drummond's Notes and Ribbon Arrows</h2>

<p>Josh shared notes from the lesson and played around with some angles. He mentioned Peter Han's <em>Dynamic Bible</em> and the four different kinds of arrows Peter uses:</p>

<ul>

<li>Simple direction</li>

<li>Motion context</li>

<li>Function/interaction</li>

<li>Call-out arrows</li>

</ul>

<p>This was new to me, and I'd like to know more about it. Josh's ribbon arrows are wonderful and well observed.</p>

<h3>Understanding Ribbon Arrows and Perspective</h3>

<p>Let's take up this ribbon arrow. We know that this arrow is going away from us that way and away from us the other way. But what if we were to misinterpret it? What if we saw the top portion coming toward us and the bottom part being exposed? It's a good exercise to remind ourselves of the relationship of silhouette and shape to form.</p>

<p>But we know that it goes like this and like this, and here is the giveaway: you used the principle of <strong>diminution</strong>. This side of the arrow is closer to us than that side, and when it's that much bigger, it's pretty clear which side is closer.</p>

<p>Another thing, if you're having trouble twisting arrows, remember that this one is based on a block in this position, and the right-angle block keeps that clear. It's got something coming out of it that will curve, and down here, it's based on a block in this position. Turning it into simpler shapes, rather than the curved thing we're seeing, helps clarify the form.</p>

<p>Josh also included a dinosaur and an insect, getting right into organicizing form. For those of you who want to apply this perspective stuff to bodies, Josh is your peer. I can see the positive influence of Peter Han on you. Thank you, Josh.</p>

<h2>Ale Pincus' Demonstration</h2>

<p>Ale Pincus not only shows us the arrow but also gives us a link. Here you are, demonstrating it by hand with a mechanical pencil without a flaw, with nary a hitch. I'm so impressed. How about if I just write paragraphs for this course and you draw? Look at this wonderful stuff.</p>

<h2>Daniel Lucas Nazari's Question on Determining Lines</h2>

<p>Daniel said, "I find it hard to determine the first three lines when determining a direction. Are there some cool tricks to remember how to steer my arrows in the right direction with my box?"</p>

<p>Careful what you ask for, Daniel. In part two, I'll put you onto hours of discerning those lines on your box. Some college students complain about it, but I have a feeling with this crowd that you will run with it toward success and emerge so aware of how to determine the first three lines and steer in the right direction. It will be in the lesson on <strong>Y-line Perpendicular to the Horizon</strong>, which may mean nothing to you, but I'll explain it then.</p>

<h2>Lucy's Daring Angles and Animation</h2>

<p>Lucy, what can I do but just sit back and showcase your daring and skill? Good drawings, so obviously freehand but with confidence and authority. Lucy even made an animation, showing the process, finding the hidden points, running them over. Great job.</p>

<h3>Rolling Boxes</h3>

<p>Now, the drawing below. Lucy, this is no small task. I'm going to do a separate video that will explain point by point how these boxes don't just bend, but they <strong>roll</strong>. You'll see.</p>

<h2>Blondie the Good's Rollicking Arrows</h2>

<p>Blondie the Good, these are good! Look at that, you took chances. You bent these things, you got that amazing foreshortening that happens when this plane is facing towards you and then at the zenith, it radically goes over with a little sliver underneath. We're going to take up one of your rollicking arrows.</p>

<p>You did this beautifully with an awareness of the right-angled lines, but we aren't sure about the relationship between this curving arrow and this static box. I'm going to explain this further in a separate video so we can take it point by point. Thank you for them, Blondie.</p>

<h2>Challenges with Naming and Labeling</h2>

<h3>Michael Longhurst's Difficulty with Labeling</h3>

<p>Michael Longhurst said, "I'm not sure why, but I found labeling the arrows really difficult and kept second-guessing myself. My best guess is that it was confusing me between the direction the observer looks at the arrows, the direction of the arrow boxes, the direction of the arrows themselves, and then losing the box plane by converting it to the arrow point."</p>

<p>Michael, you did fine.</p>

<h3>Rupert DDD's Approach Without Names</h3>

<p>Rupert DDD said, "I'm not sure about the naming convention, so I just made the arrows face outward and inwards."</p>

<p>Well, Rupert, I said it before, if you can do it, and you're doing it, how important are the names? The names are, to many of us, the easy intro to this. That's a reason to do them, to ease into the complexity, but not everybody is a word person. Some of the best at their craft are not word people.</p>

<p>I'm encouraging you that if you can do it without language, that is great. But a lot of learning gets passed through language historically, and that may change with you all as a group. As you become so competent at the skill of making pictures, we may switch culturally from learning through language to learning through imagery. Rupert, good job, names or not.</p>

<h2>Smithies' Persistent Practice</h2>

<p>Smithies posted these fine examples and also wrote about the process:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"It might sound silly, but I've always wanted to be able to draw arrows like this and have seen it as a key weakness of my drawing that I can't do something so deceptively simple. One thousand arrows later, and I have put something together. Granted, I haven't watched the extra video on it yet, so when I do, I probably will see everything I did wrong, but I have battled this arrow to death. For the time being, here's to you.</p>

<p>I have done and redone and redone the assignment, and I can now kind of visualize what I want to draw before I draw it, which was not possible at the beginning. I still put it down wrong to begin with, but after about three redraws, I finally get an arrow that works, kind of.</p>

<p>I tried not to draw boxes and fill them in for this. That might sound dumb, but I wanted to try and think logically about whether something was close and therefore bigger."</p>

</blockquote>

<p>That this is a basic skill, and your willingness to do it and redo it and redo it shows that you've got an attitude of embracing the basics to do the more complex stuff later.</p>

<p>Smithies had a hard time simplifying a blocky form but then said that drawing out the boxes in the first picture definitely made things clearer. This is a course of theme and variations with regular progression in the variations. We are going somewhere with it.</p>

<h2>Lynn's Foreshortening and Right Angles</h2>

<p>Let's look at Lynn's work. Lynn mentions "enemy ship with the right angles", we'll get to that. Everybody, look at these daring angles and not only daring angles, but these gradations of foreshortening, gradually bringing it into the daring positions.</p>

<p>Dear students, if you are having trouble foreshortening, take a good, patient look at how Lynn did it and how daring sometimes comes about gradually in increments.</p>

<p>In at least two uploads, you confessed frustration with seeing right angles in perspective, even claiming that you are fighting right angles because they hate you.</p>

<p>I have an encouragement for you. It's not fun when you want it to look right and you can't get it to look right, but there is something good about it. It shows a sensitive eye. Another person might get them wrong, and it wouldn't bother them. When it bothers you, that's indication that you've got a high level of sensitivity, which I believe is one component of what we call talent.</p>

<p>It doesn't guarantee anything, we can be sensitive and suck. But if we're pursuing excellence, it is a pain to be thankful for.</p>

<h2>Responses to "How I Tipped the Arrows" Video</h2>

<p>Now let's look at the posts from a week later, the responses to the video <strong>"How I Tipped the Arrows"</strong> and the airplane redraws.</p>

<h3>Dee Dee Anderson's Triumph Over Proportions</h3>

<p>Dee Dee Anderson, Ganda, is an encourager to others. You did the work, and the proportions were not the issue. Making them slim and thick is probably a good thing, because you dealt with form, not proportion. And you created form, so now, by the time you're seeing this video, you are working on proportion, a good order, I think.</p>

<h3>Playfulness in Proportions</h3>

<p>Case in point, Darren, look at the inventiveness of proportion that comes with play. Randy Pontillo did likewise. Mon did barrel rolls with 3D sound effects. Why not mess about with proportion? Then conform to correctness as a discipline, then go back to play.</p>

<p>Like with Dee Dee's second post, we get the comment:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Quite satisfied with the result, albeit the construction lines are quite messy, trying to aim for good enough proportions, and it requires quite a focus and time in the end. I like the feeling of triumph after managing to defeat General Airplane of the perspective 3D squad."</p>

</blockquote>

<p>When it works, the pain gives way to a feeling of triumph.</p>

<h3>Frank's Airplane Drawing</h3>

<p>Frank, good arrows. And this airplane where you built the imaginary propeller blade, and you also kept this plane flat all the way around like it wouldn't be on an actual airplane but like it would be on our models where we're trying to keep right angles in there.</p>

<p>Instead of tapering it tight, you kept a Z line intact, which helps make it look thick. However, when it comes to the Y lines, which are aiming up that way, this one would aim up that way. So we've got a taper here that doesn't match the other ones. The secret to this is to be thinking as much as possible in X, Ys, and Zs, just to remind ourselves of the directions until the grids take care of it for us.</p>

<h3>Daniela's Challenges with Upside-Down Drawing</h3>

<p>Daniela, good work with a glitch that I'll point out. I admire you. Look at how this plane wing shows a front plane on the wing, and then when you turn it upside down, somehow that plane wing that is supposed to be coming toward us, like the plane is assuming this is the front, we are seeing the back of the plane wing.</p>

<p>But hey, when you're upside down, it's hard to dance. If you want the challenge of getting used to that and you're on online software like Google Meet or Zoom and you turn off the mirroring thing so that instead of like a mirror where this side is that side, it flips it around the way the people will see you, try adjusting your hair. It'll put your brain into a new mode.</p>

<p>Now, this daring to turn it upside down, even if you flipped the wing, can teach you lessons, and not just lessons that are negative, like don't do that, but also lessons that tell a truth and exaggerate it. Notice how much of this top plane at the front we see, and how that radically changes direction. Well, that is what happens if our eye is looking down into this plane that is tipped toward us, and then looking along that plane that is truly level.</p>

<p>This is what happens. You may have seen it in the model if you were using a close-up, wide-angle view. It does call attention to itself, but it calls attention to itself in a way that we're going to get to with these close proximity views. Look at this one over here on the side, doing the same thing. The whole plane feels curved. But everything, when you get up close, starts to curve, that's why they call it <strong>curvilinear perspective</strong>, yet to come.</p>

<h3>Josh Drummond's Toy Plane</h3>

<p>Josh Drummond got a compliment from Rachel and a compliment from me, not only for your drawings but for the fact that you have adopted a toy that you will draw from all angles and get to know it.</p>

<h3>Rupert DDD's Technical Bent</h3>

<p>Rupert DDD displays a remarkable technical bent. Look at that projection from side and from front back into the plane, and the cleanliness and control of your hand-drawn lines. This is style as well as understanding. Thank you, Rupert, for this.</p>

<p>By the time you see this video, we will have moved into proportion and how it changes with the object's position and with your point of view.</p>

<h2>Comments on Using the Zolli App</h2>

<p>Let me take a moment to talk about the Zolli app and its limitations. I think most people are not good at self-teaching. It helps to have some guidance and assistance. You're going to get it in a couple lessons from now.</p>

<p>In the meantime, you can mess around with Zolli, but the coming lesson, and our final lesson in part one, will have everything to do with what we developed that app for. The closer you get to something, as with Carlos's plane, the more it changes in ways that are surprising and that it takes mastery to understand. So there will be a payoff for all of this.</p>

<p>But the Zolli app, though it is not necessary, is essentially a toy collection. We will move into a lesson group on <strong>eye level and horizon</strong>, and we'll put you onto drawing room after room after room with quick drawings to establish where your eye level is and keeping things level for simplicity.</p>

<p>And then I will do a demo of an anvil without a model, entirely from orthos, and we will go through this finding hidden points inside the structure one point at a time. See you then.</p>
