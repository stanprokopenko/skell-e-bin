<p>I'm Eric Gist, and today I'll walk you through the ideation phase of creating a comic book cover. This phase, often called <strong>thumbnailing</strong>, involves making tiny sketches to develop our ideas. It's all about <strong>design, shape dynamics, and silhouette</strong>, not detailed drawing or anatomy.</p>

<h2>Focusing on Design and Silhouette</h2>

<p>In thumbnailing, I concentrate on a simple <strong>three-value design</strong>. My goal is to create a compelling image that tells the story through bold shapes and contrasts. I'm not too worried about perspective, but I do use it loosely to guide the composition. It's essential to think about how <strong>light against dark</strong> will make elements pop or recede, helping to convey the story effectively.</p>

<h2>Setting Up in Procreate</h2>

<p>I'm working in <strong>Procreate</strong>, and I've prepared a template for the cover. I've also got character sheets to ensure I'm using the correct designs for the Fantastic Four. These sheets help me understand the costumes and patterns, which influence the overall value breakdown and design.</p>

<p>I prefer the <strong>Peppermint pencil</strong> under the sketching tools, it feels closest to a real pencil, making the transition from traditional to digital smoother.</p>

<h2>Planning the Composition</h2>

<p>I want to showcase both the <strong>individuality</strong> of each character and how they function as a <strong>team</strong>. My core idea is to illustrate how each member's unique abilities enhance the whole.</p>

<p>I start by sketching a rough <strong>three-point perspective</strong>, using Procreate's perspective grid to guide me. My initial concept involves the <strong>Fantasticar</strong>, with:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Reed Richards (Mr. Fantastic)</strong> piloting at the front.</li>

<li><strong>Sue Storm</strong> at his right side in the right pontoon.</li>

<li><strong>Ben Grimm (The Thing)</strong> relaxing in the back, feet up to emphasize his size.</li>

<li><strong>Franklin Richards</strong> in the near pontoon, possibly losing his ice cream due to Reed's driving.</li>

<li><strong>Johnny Storm (Human Torch)</strong> flying alongside, separate but still part of the team.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Sketching and Using Perspectives</h2>

<p>Working small helps maintain a strong design that reads well at various sizes. I keep the sketches loose, focusing on the overall feel rather than details. Using Procreate's tools, I can easily adjust elements, move them around, and experiment with composition.</p>

<p>I apply a simple <strong>three-value system</strong>, creating small value squares to limit myself to <strong>light</strong>, <strong>medium</strong>, and <strong>dark</strong> tones. This restriction forces me to think critically about the <strong>value relationships</strong> and ensures a strong graphical read.</p>

<h2>Working with Values and Silhouettes</h2>

<p>I begin blocking in the background with my lightest value, suggesting a cityscape in three-point perspective. Then, I layer my medium value to silhouette the Fantasticar, establishing a strong contrast against the background.</p>

<p>Next, I use the darkest value to define the characters and crucial elements. I focus on <strong>silhouetting</strong> each character to make them stand out:</p>

<ul>

<li>Reed's stretching arm catching Franklin's ice cream.</li>

<li>Sue's hair blowing, possibly rendered in white to pop against the background.</li>

<li>Ben's relaxed pose with his feet up, possibly holding popcorn.</li>

<li>Johnny as a bright, fiery figure flying around the ship.</li>

</ul>

<p>I pay attention to <strong>cast shadows</strong> and how they interact with the characters and the ship. This consideration helps enhance depth and directs the viewer's eye throughout the composition.</p>

<h2>Refining the Thumbnail</h2>

<p>At this stage, I resist the urge to overdraw. It's essential to keep the thumbnail simple, focusing on the <strong>graphic shapes</strong> and overall design. I consider the placement of the <strong>title</strong> and how it integrates with the image.</p>

<p>I also watch out for <strong>tangents</strong>, ensuring that elements either overlap clearly or have enough separation to avoid visual confusion. For example, I decide whether Reed's arm should overlap with a cast shadow or not, avoiding any awkward tangents.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p>I'm happy with how the thumbnail is shaping up. It captures the dynamics, storytelling, and family essence of the Fantastic Four. The composition balances unity and diversity, with enough excitement and movement to engage the viewer.</p>

<p>From here, I could present this thumbnail to the art director. If approved, I'd proceed to tighten the drawing and add details, enhancing what's already working. But for now, the thumbnail serves its purpose: a clear, compelling design that tells the story effectively.</p>
