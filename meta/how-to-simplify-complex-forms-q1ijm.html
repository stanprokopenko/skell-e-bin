<h2>A Childlike Approach</h2>

<p>I like to break things down with a <strong>childlike simplicity</strong>. That doesn’t mean it’s easy, but it can help make drawing less overwhelming. My goal is to <strong>simplify without getting silly</strong>. If we make a figure too simple, it won’t look believable. If we make it overly complex, we risk getting frustrated. We aim for a balance: <strong>as simple as possible</strong> while <strong>still looking true</strong> to life.</p>

<h2>2D vs. 3D</h2>

<p>When I talk about structure, I usually mean <strong>three-dimensional</strong> ideas. A <strong>two-dimensional shape</strong> is flat, like circles, squares, ovals, or rectangles. A <strong>three-dimensional form</strong> has volume, like spheres, cylinders, or boxes.</p>

<p>• A shape shows a flat silhouette around the edge.<br />

• A form breaks that contour and helps the viewer see how it <strong>turns in space</strong>.</p>

<p>I can show three-dimensional form by adding <strong>construction lines</strong> that move around and over the shape. This suggests volume and helps me position the form intuitively without strict perspective rules. If I want more precise perspective, I can add vanishing points and other methods, but I often <strong>work intuitively</strong>.</p>

<h2>Corners and Structure</h2>

<p><strong>Corners</strong> give a clear sense of form and position. With a flat circle, you can’t tell if it’s leaning left or right. But if you stretch that circle into an oval or box shape with corners, it reveals how it’s tilted or angled. More corners mean more structure.</p>

<p>• <strong>Leaning</strong>: We see how something tilts forward or back.<br />

• <strong>Tilting</strong>: We see how something angles side to side or top to bottom.<br />

• <strong>Facing</strong>: We see which side is turning toward us.</p>

<p>Adding more corners (like edges on a box) increases the sense of volume. Whether I’m drawing a head, a figure, or a still life, if I want strong three-dimensionality, I break the form into corners.</p>

<h2>Keeping Colors Neutral</h2>

<p>When focusing on structure, I avoid bright, saturated colors at first. I keep things <strong>earthy or gray</strong> so the color doesn’t distract from the shapes and forms. Later, color can enhance the mood, but <strong>value</strong> (lightness and darkness) usually matters more for showing form and depth.</p>

<h2>Why Value Matters</h2>

<p>Value refers to how light or dark something is. Even a simple shape becomes <strong>believable</strong> when I use the right values. In many classical approaches (like the Atelier system), artists block in two-dimensional shapes and separate light from shadow with carefully planned values. This alone can create a powerful sense of realism.</p>

<p>Once I master light and shadow in black and white or subtle gray tones, adding color is simpler. Color’s intensity, hue, and temperature all work best if the value structure is sound.</p>

<h2>Gesture and Structure Together</h2>

<p>Next, I’ll talk about <strong>gesture</strong>, the movement and flow of a pose. Gesture and structure go hand in hand. We’ll blend them to create art that feels alive, yet remains solid and believable. We’ll alternate between <strong>two-dimensional</strong> when it gets tricky, and <strong>three-dimensional</strong> when we feel confident. This keeps our approach <strong>simple, yet characteristic</strong>.</p>

<p>Thanks for hanging out with me. Let’s keep things simple, keep practicing, and enjoy the process.</p>
