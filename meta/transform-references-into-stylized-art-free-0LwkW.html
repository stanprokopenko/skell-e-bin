<h2>What's in Premium?</h2>

<p>Discover how to transform a photo reference into a stylized portrait by pairing 2D shape-thinking with 3D forms. Youâ€™ll see how to rough sketch and refine your line work in passes, then establish values and merge layers to keep your drawing flexible. From there, learn to add color using layer modes for subtle variations and highlights that bring the character to life. Shape pushing, color choices, and lighting tips all build toward a process that balances realism with exaggeration.</p>
