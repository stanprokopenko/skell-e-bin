<p>I often find hands are one of the most challenging parts of the body to draw. It's not just that they have five digits and complex joints, it's also because they can take on a huge variety of poses and gestures. Here, I'll share my basic approach to structure and gesture, so we have a solid foundation before we dive deeper into details.</p>

<h2>Basic Structure</h2>

<p>I like to think of the <strong>back of the hand</strong> (or <strong>palm</strong>) as a <strong>2x3 proportion</strong>, a shape a bit longer than it is wide, similar to what we use for the head and rib cage. It’s not a hard rule, but a helpful starting point</p>

<ul>

<li>The wrist is usually <strong>more narrow</strong> than the area around the <strong>knuckles</strong>.</li>

<li>I imagine the hand as a <strong>box</strong> rather than an egg. The knuckles create a curved “top edge” that suggests a box-like structure.</li>

<li>When I start, I often <strong>omit the thumb</strong>, blocking in a simple form for the hand first. Then I add the thumb afterward.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Gesture and Flow</h2>

<p>I like to capture the gesture throughout the entire arm, flowing into the hand and sometimes extending into the fingers. Even if it's just for a quick sketch:</p>

<ul>

<li>Each finger has its own subtle gesture.</li>

<li>The <strong>hand often flows out of a curve or S-curve</strong> from the forearm into the wrist and then into the knuckles.</li>

<li>If I want to keep it simple, I’ll draw a <strong>mitten shape</strong> for the fingers and separate them later.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Adding the Thumb</h2>

<p>I treat the thumb as a <strong>second step</strong>. After I’ve established the main shape of the hand, I place the thumb:</p>

<ul>

<li>It might overlap or tuck behind, depending on the pose. </li>

<li>It also creates a <strong>wide “webbing”</strong> that can shift the overall shape of the hand.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Finger Alignment</h2>

<p>A useful detail is how the <strong>pointer and middle fingers</strong> align with the arm when the hand is in a strong, straight pose, like a punch. The <strong>ring and little fingers</strong> often fall slightly back or away from that line, which is why punches traditionally land with those first two knuckles,</p>

<ul>

<li>The pointer and middle fingers are the <strong>dominant knuckles</strong> when aligning a strike.</li>

<li>The ring and little fingers are <strong>less aligned</strong> and tend to recede.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Putting It All Together</h2>

<p>When I draw a hand, I’m always balancing <strong>structure and gesture</strong>. I watch for the main shapes and proportions, then look for natural curves and potential corner breaks. I keep an eye on how the hand aligns with the forearm, where it widens at the knuckles, and how the fingers operate individually or as a unit. With these fundamentals, I can check any pose or perspective more confidently.</p>
