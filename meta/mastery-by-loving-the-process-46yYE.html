<h2>Welcome Back</h2>

<p>I'm so proud of you for joining me on this quest to become a better artist. Having completed all 15 hours, I know you're already improving.</p>

<h2>What's Next?</h2>

<p>Go back and do it again, with love and the understanding that it is not a chore. It is the spirit of who you are, to enjoy the process. Once you learn to enjoy the process, nothing is ever hard again.</p>

<h2>Love Every Line and Tone</h2>

<p>Love every line, love every tone, and use it as fuel to do the best work you possibly can.</p>

<h2>A Bridge Between Workshops</h2>

<p>This journey is a bridge between all of my workshops:</p>

<ul>

<li>Fantasy</li>

<li>Figure Drawing</li>

<li>Wizardry</li>

<li>Drawing the Fantasy Female Figure</li>

<li>And many others</li>

</ul>

<p>It's the osmosis, the imbibing of this over and over, that will make you a brilliant artist.</p>

<h2>Embracing Simple Shapes</h2>

<p>Embrace the very power of simple shapes that can be manipulated, twisted, turned, and loved into beautiful forms. This powerful tool has been a wonder for me, and I hope it's been the same for you.</p>

<h2>A Final Salute</h2>

<p>I salute you, my sorcerers now, magicians all. I look forward to seeing all your work in the future and the waves you'll make from embracing what I have embraced.</p>

<p><strong>Good luck!</strong></p>
