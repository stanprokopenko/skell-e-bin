<p>When we think of perspective, we usually imagine these complicated grid lines like we're in a 3D computer world. But we don't need to always use fancy perspective lines to indicate depth. We can use something much more simple called <strong>depth cues</strong>. They're so simple, they're often overlooked. Let's go over six ways to indicate form and depth in our drawings.</p>

<h2>Overlap</h2>

<p>One of the most powerful ways to suggest that something is in front of something else is using <strong>overlap</strong>. When you overlap one object over another, it looks like the first object is in front. For example, if you overlap the left elephant over the right one, it looks like the left elephant is in front. But if you switch the overlaps, it reverses the effect, and now the right elephant is in front. Overlap is one of the most simple, foolproof ways to suggest depth. It overrides all the other depth cues to communicate what is in front.</p>

<h2>Diminution</h2>

<p>The next depth cue is <strong>diminution</strong>. This means that things appear smaller as they go back into the distance. You see this every day: people, cars, and things way in the distance look tiny. If you make an elephant that's far away the same size as an elephant that's close up, it looks like a giant. Simple enough—things in the distance get smaller.</p>

<h2>Convergence</h2>

<p><strong>Convergence</strong> is the idea that things get smaller and smaller until they reach a dot, called a vanishing point. In a box, the parallel edges will converge, meaning they're angled a bit towards that vanishing point. But not everything is a box. Even if there are no obvious parallel edge lines to converge, things will still converge towards the vanishing point. For example, if you have a person standing close to the camera, you can converge their height towards the vanishing point to know how tall they would be at any point in the distance. You can fit anything into a box, and if you can converge a box's edges towards a vanishing point, you can converge anything.</p>

<h2>Foreshortening</h2>

<p><strong>Foreshortening</strong> is when things go forward towards us, and their length appears shorter. With a 3D object, some part of it will always be foreshortened. For example, on a box, the top is much shorter than if you were to look at it straight down. When you rotate the box, different planes become foreshortened. Boxes help us imagine the planes of any 3D object so that we can foreshorten the planes going forward.</p>

<h2>Atmospheric Perspective</h2>

<p><strong>Atmospheric perspective</strong> is the idea that things farther away have more atmosphere in front of them that hides them. Little particles of water or dust in the air make it look like things are receding into a fog. The farther they go into the fog, the harder it is to see them. This applies to lines as well—lines that are farther away are lighter. Atmospheric perspective is both linear and tonal; it's the bridge between the two.</p>

<h2>Rendering</h2>

<p><strong>Rendering</strong> is the use of light and shading to reveal the three-dimensional form of an object. This is the main thing you'll learn in the values and edges section of this course. Rendering is purely tonal and involves using the laws of light to shade and reveal form.</p>

<p>To recap, the four linear perspective depth cues are Overlap, Diminution, Convergence, and Foreshortening. These cues help you indicate depth and form in your drawings without relying on complex perspective grids. In the next lesson, you'll learn how to draw using one-point perspective. See you next time!</p>
