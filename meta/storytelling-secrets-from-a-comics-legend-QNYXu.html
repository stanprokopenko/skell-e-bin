<h2>Early Passion for Film</h2>

<p>As a kid, <strong>I loved film</strong>. I was one of those kids who, despite a nine o'clock curfew, would unplug our little black and white TV, bring it to my bed, and put the covers over me because <strong>"2001: A Space Odyssey"</strong> was showing at midnight. I absorbed all of that. My aspiration was to get into film school.</p>

<h2>Entry into Comics</h2>

<p>But like a lot of people, <strong>I couldn't afford film school</strong> at the time. My cousin came in and said, "Hey, there's this convention downtown, San Diego Comic Con." He dragged me over there with my portfolio, and <strong>I was very lucky</strong>. That was my very first San Diego Comic Con, and that year, every single editor from Marvel was there on a talent search. They were looking for talent.</p>

<h2>Meeting Karl Potts</h2>

<p>There, I met <strong>senior editor Karl Potts</strong>, still a very good friend of mine. He saw my work and saw the potential in me. I'm very grateful to Karl because, at the time, and still today, the business is just too busy to pick up somebody that's 80% or 90% of the way there. Usually, they say, "You're pretty good, but you need a few more things to learn. Come back next year."</p>

<h2>Learning Storytelling</h2>

<p>Karl was different. He got my number, and every month he would bug me for new samples. After a short time, he saw that <strong>I really had the potential</strong> and that I really wanted it. All of a sudden, I got a FedEx package in the mail from Marvel. It was <strong>"The Five C's of Cinematography"</strong>, one of the best books to learn how to tell a story visually. He said, "Study this up. Once you figure it all out, I'll give you a job." I took the challenge and <strong>learned storytelling</strong>.</p>

<h2>Starting as an Inker</h2>

<p>I've always wanted to be <strong>the penciler</strong>. Everybody wants to be the top dog. When I came to Marvel, I learned that you had to actually tell a story. You couldn't just get by drawing pretty pictures. As I was studying cinematography and storytelling, I started <strong>inking</strong> to make some money while I was learning. I helped get other artists' work into a printable form.</p>

<h2>Transition to Penciling</h2>

<p>As I learned cinematography, I got into being <strong>a penciler</strong>, drawing the actual drawings and storytelling. Because it's a small art core, if you showed inklings for anything else, opportunities opened up for you. Very quickly, on the X-books, <strong>I was asked to create a character named Bishop</strong>, and so I started writing.</p>

<h2>Founding Image Comics</h2>

<p>As we went into <strong>Image Comics</strong>, we were now on the production side, and the retail side too. We had to prepare our books, we couldn't just produce and do the work. We learned about retail, distribution, and promotion. That's a big part, learning everything.</p>

<h2>The Scope of Artistic Talent</h2>

<p><strong>Art is a very big field</strong>. It encompasses singing, dancing, production design, drawing, film, animation, everything. To have talent in any one of those fields, it's the same kind of talent. It's art talent. Once you have any kind of talent, like me getting into comics first as an inker, you can easily get into other areas in creative art, like penciling and character creation.</p>

<h2>Encouraging Aspiring Artists</h2>

<p>If you have the drive, you can get into anything because everything in art is the same. I think that's one of the most important things for young aspiring artists, to first recognize that. Not that you're a pro yet, that's going to take time, but just finding out that you've got the talent, that you're creative.</p>

<p>As I've learned through my 40 years, it's always that first big step where an aspiring artist could be drawing and struggling for five years in their little bat cave rooms. They could be kind of good, but they don't know. They only have themselves. When a professional artist sees your work and says, "Hey, you're pretty good," every time I've done that or seen anybody else do that, that aspiring artist, <strong>boom!</strong> Just that confidence, just that kick.</p>

<h2>Focus in Composition</h2>

<p>My answer is not your typical art answer. A lot of people will go into theories and stuff like that, the <strong>Rule of Thirds</strong> or the <strong>Golden Ratio</strong>. One, we don't have the time to do that. I draw an issue of Uncanny, and I'm bringing in our new X-Men, Bishop. I've got to design his character, his costume, figure out his power, figure out how he fits into the story, set up all the production locations like the X-Men office, and I have to do all the key art with the cover and stuff, all in four weeks. You give that same load to the best film crew and director, they get four years.</p>

<p>So, what I've fallen on studying is <strong>focus</strong>. Let's say you have a team of seven characters, and they're all fighting the enemy. Cyclops is the leader, and he's barking orders. <strong>He's the focal point</strong>. You've got to choose. He's like this. So when I draw an enemy over here to Scott's left, I'm not going to have his arms flinging out and pointing off the panel. I'm going to have his arms like this, pointing at Scott.</p>

<h2>Directing the Reader's Eye</h2>

<p>If I have smoke billowing, I'm not just going to get into the smoke and go, "Oh, cool." No, I'm going to make sure the smoke starts pointing, not every single time but a majority of times, pointing back to Scott. Some may go way off, but then come back. If I have boards hanging down or pillars, I'm going to try to have them angled so that they point to Scott. I'm going to have the rest of the X-Men, no matter what they do, like Storm is going to fly off here, but she does this instead. She's still flying off, but her hand and her looking at Scott, <strong>points the reader to the focal point</strong>, to Scott.</p>

<p>It's saying Even though we have all these people here, all these other elements, here's the focal point, Scott going like this. Almost all of my elements are pointing towards him. So when the reader looks at that image, they know where they're supposed to look. It's all direction, it's all focus.</p>

<h2>Embracing Digital Tools</h2>

<p>I'm proud to say <strong>I'm one of the geekiest of the geeks</strong>. Back in 1989, I bought my first desktop computer just so I could do ray tracing, just so I could build models. I knew when I got into directing movies, I wanted to have special effects in them. When ZBrush came in, when Blender came in, I got into all that.</p>

<p>So you would kind of think that I do everything digitally, and I used to do a lot of things digitally. There's a lot of my professional work that I have done digitally, but <strong>efficiency is the name of the game</strong> in any professional world.</p>

<h2>Combining Digital and Traditional Methods</h2>

<p>I could draw a cover and realize I've drawn the Incredible Hulk, and he is a little off. With the lasso tool, in two seconds, you pick it up and move him into the middle, or he's too big, and you need more room for the background, so you squeeze him, in two seconds. In real life, that sketch took you maybe ten minutes. Now you've got to erase it, and do another ten-minute drawing.</p>

<p>So the efficiency of digital is that. <strong>I do all my layouts digitally</strong>. I work out the anatomy, no shading, no costumes, not even hair sometimes, just until that outline is exactly what I want it. Once that outline is set, it isn't going to change much at all.</p>

<h2>Printing and Inking</h2>

<p>I then <strong>print that blue line onto actual paper</strong>, 11 by 17-inch art boards, and then ink it traditionally. All the underlying work is already done, and now I can just concentrate on shading and spot blacks and everything. If you make a mistake, print out another one. You don't have to do the build-up work anymore after that.</p>

<h2>Freedom to Experiment</h2>

<p>For artists, that gives you a lot of freedom. No matter how good I was at the time, there's always that fear: <strong>Am I going to mess up?</strong> There's always that worry, but if you've got that backup of, "Oh hey, I'll just print out another one," then you can go crazy. The best thing is because you've got that backup, now you can experiment.</p>

<p>Hey, I was thinking about doing the lighting this way, but let me try this. You could try it, and if it doesn't work, okay, cool, print out another one and do what you originally thought. The freedom that gives you as an artist, I think that's one of the reasons we're seeing so many different styles, so many different forms, so much experimenting with different things and mediums.</p>

<h2>Approach to Cover Art</h2>

<p><strong>My cover process has changed over the years</strong>. Back in the day, you didn't get covers, you were the artist on the book, so you did the interior, and you got the cover. Nowadays, the cover has become such prime real estate, and they bring in "top guns" to do that.</p>

<p>Back then, because you were the interior artist, you read the plot. You might have, by this time, already drawn that story, so you knew the intricacies of it. More importantly, you knew, "There's this one shot I really want to do, but the plot didn't allow me to do that." So now you've got this cover that really connects to that book and that story.</p>

<h2>Challenges with Modern Covers</h2>

<p>Nowadays, especially with multiple variants, you're called in to <strong>do your best shot as you</strong>. A lot of times, they don't even give you a brief on what the story is. They just tell you But because I came from film, I wanted to tell visual stories, and for me, the story that I'm drawing, even if it's just one cover image, is important.</p>

<h2>Finding New Angles</h2>

<p>I've drawn Wolverine five million times, and after a while, you kind of, this is the wrong word, but you kind of get bored and want to try something else. That something else is, "Okay, he's mad, and he's going at it with both guns blazing, but he doesn't want to kill this person." He has this long history with him, he knew him before he was a bad guy. He doesn't want to do it, but for the sake of society and the greater good, he's got to take this guy down.</p>

<p>Now I'm going to try to show <strong>pain in his face</strong>, pain that he's going to take out somebody he knows and doesn't want to but knows he has to. Even if it doesn't come out to the viewer, for me drawing it, that's now a different drawing than the last time I did this. That's how I approach it.</p>

<h2>The Impact of Art Beyond Intent</h2>

<p>What I really love are the images I’ve been able to do that reach audiences I never thought of, I never intended to reach. That's what makes my work in the X-office magical for me.</p>

<p>I started in the Uncanny office. I wanted to do my best because this is the team, the original X-team, and I wanted to do my best interpretation of them. One time, my editor, Suzanne Gaffney, said, "Storm is getting this reputation as being the ice queen, being a competent, strong leader, but she never shows emotions." People don't warm up to her. Can you do something about that?</p>

<h2>Storm in the Rain</h2>

<p>We went back and forth, and ended up with a half-shot of <strong>Storm crying in the rain</strong>. Up front, it just looks like the X-Men leader is in the rain, but if you look real closely, you see a couple of crooked streaks. When I did that, I was just following Suzanne's lead of showing another side of Storm, an emotional side.</p>

<p>But to this day, I'm proud that I can go to conventions, and it started with people in society who felt like they were outsiders, the nerds, the people that others ignored, picked on, and bullied. Then it grew into the LGBTQ community, and then it grew internationally across different ethnicities. Everybody looked at that cover, and it seemed to say, **"That's me too." ** I cry, and people don't know I'm crying.</p>

<h2>Art That Resonates</h2>

<p>That wasn't my original intent for societal effect. My intent was just for Storm. But <strong>art is such that it can be interpreted beyond by whoever's looking at it and whatever is true in their life</strong>. That has to be the number one cover that I am really proud to have done because it has now morphed into something else. I really think that's what real art is all about.</p>
