<p>I’ve done thousands of figure drawings from life, and I’ve discovered a simple but powerful process to separate light and shadow. I start by mapping that <strong>key separation</strong> where the light side meets the shadow side. Once I set those edges, filling in the shadow areas becomes quick and efficient. </p>

<p>In this lesson, I’m focusing on <strong>shadow mapping</strong>. This happens after I’ve blocked in the basic proportions, and major shapes. I then switch to establishing the <strong>edges of the shadows</strong>, something that solidifies the 3D forms. When I do it well, the drawing immediately starts to feel dimensional.</p>

<h2>Understanding Light and Shadow Edges</h2>

<h3>Core Shadows</h3>

<p>Core shadows are found along the <strong>terminator</strong>, the borderline where direct light stops hitting the form. How sharp or soft I draw that edge can show how quickly or smoothly the form transitions away from the light. When light direction is more distinct and the form has a strong plane change, I’ll use a firmer edge. On rounder surfaces or soft transitions, I’ll use a softer edge.</p>

<h3>Cast Shadows</h3>

<p>Cast shadows show up when one form blocks the light from another surface. They can create strong <strong>sharp edges</strong> that help show the relationship of overlapping forms. When a form is near a background or overlapping another form, I often see cast shadows that help define the distance and interaction between them.</p>

<h2>Finding the Terminator</h2>

<p>The <strong>terminator</strong> is the precise area where the light can no longer reach. This line divides the light and shadow families. It can be tricky to see when halftones, reflected lights, and dark backgrounds confuse the eye, but the terminator is always the true boundary between the lit and unlit sides.</p>

<p>Sometimes I like to imagine a slice through a form with a plane perpendicular to the light. Where that plane touches the object is where the terminator lies. With complex shapes, each “slice” can be angled differently, so the terminator can twist along an arm, leg, or any organic form. Over time, I’ve grown comfortable guessing where it should be if it’s not completely visible.</p>

<h2>Complex Forms</h2>

<p>It’s usually easiest to learn on a simpler shape, like a cylinder. If the light source is above, the top cap is lit, and the cylinder’s side transitions into shadow around its curve. On an <strong>arm</strong>, which is essentially cylindrical, the terminator might shift as the form changes direction. If I see bumps or valleys, I adjust the shadow boundary accordingly. </p>

<p>I also keep in mind that <strong>reflected lights</strong> can appear in the shadow area. They don’t mean that part of the form is in light, it’s still shadow, just a bit brighter than other shadow regions. This can confuse me at first, so I always check if the main light is really hitting that spot or if it is just a reflection.</p>

<h2>Common Mistakes</h2>

<p>• <strong>Soft, flat lighting</strong>: If the light source is very diffused, the boundary between light and shadow can be subtle. In that case, I invent a terminator based on a logical light direction.<br />

• <strong>Dark halftones mistaken for shadow</strong>: A halftone can be quite dark but might not actually be in the shadow family.<br />

• <strong>Reflected lights mistaken for direct lights</strong>: Brightness in the shadow might look like direct light, but it’s still part of the shadow.<br />

• <strong>Overlooking hidden cast shadows</strong>: Sometimes a muscle or a bone casts a subtle shadow onto an adjacent form. If I treat that as a core shadow instead, the shape can look incorrect.</p>

<h2>Practice Projects</h2>

<h3>Level One</h3>

<p>I’ve provided several reference photos of arms. I start with a linear lay-in of the proportions, then I carefully map the core shadows, cast shadows, and contours. I focus on getting each edge type right. I don’t need to do any rendered shading, I just want my lines to describe where the form turns away from the light and where a cast shadow might be.</p>

<h3>Level Two</h3>

<p>Using the next set of references, I have to invent the light source myself because these photos are flat-lit. I imagine the light coming from somewhere specific, then I draw each terminator, focusing on correct <strong>edge types</strong> (softer on large rounded forms, firmer on tendons and bones, sharp for cast shadows). I also invent cast shadows where appropriate.</p>
