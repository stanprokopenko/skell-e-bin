<h2>Stacking Goals</h2>

<p>I like to <strong>stack a few goals</strong> whenever I draw. I focus on:<br />

- <strong>Connective strategies</strong> (curves and corners, beanbags and drumsticks)<br />

- <strong>Simple forms</strong> (balls, boxes, and tubes)<br />

- <strong>Mark making</strong> (aiming for more beautiful lines)<br />

- <strong>Strong shape design</strong>  </p>

<p>These goals help me measure my success. For example, if I’m working on connecting forms, I might not worry as much about the prettiness of my lines at first. But once I feel good about one area, I add on another focus.</p>

<h2>Basic Construction</h2>

<h3>T for the Torso</h3>

<p>I often start by drawing a <strong>T-shape</strong> for the shoulders. I compare this shoulder line to a vertical or horizontal guide to keep it aligned. This helps me build a <strong>solid foundation</strong> before adding detailed shapes.</p>

<h3>Egg for the Rib Cage</h3>

<p>Then I draw an <strong>egg shape</strong> for the rib cage. It doesn’t need to be anatomically perfect. I might trim a bit off the top where the shoulder girdle meets the rib cage. Sometimes I visualize two eggs for each side, or I start with a <strong>two-dimensional side shape</strong> and refine it later.</p>

<h3>Defining the Waist and Stomach</h3>

<p>As I move down, I note the <strong>waist</strong>, the <strong>stomach</strong>, and where these meet the rib cage and hips. Little markers, like the <strong>crotch</strong> or <strong>belly button</strong>, help me stay accurate. I lighten earlier lines if they get messy and adjust as needed.</p>

<h2>Using Overlaps</h2>

<p>When a limb or another form overlaps the torso or hips, I try to see the <strong>complete form</strong> behind it. I sometimes lean or move to a different vantage point so I can <strong>visualize the full shape</strong>. Even if it’s hidden, drawing it lightly helps keep my perspective correct.</p>

<h2>Refining Shapes and Proportions</h2>

<p>I treat each region as <strong>simple forms</strong> (eggs, tubes, or boxes). Once I have these, I compare each new piece to the others. I look for overlaps and corrections to maintain good proportions:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Egg for the shoulder</strong>  </li>

<li><strong>Tube for the arm</strong>  </li>

<li><strong>Beanbag for the torso</strong>  </li>

</ul>

<p>With every layer of detail, I refine shape and proportion a bit more.</p>

<h2>Adding Character</h2>

<p>After laying in generic forms, I start adding <strong>characteristic details</strong>. A slight bulge for the stomach or a clearer waistline helps the figure feel more natural. This also helps me check if my proportions match the pose I see.</p>

<h2>Visualizing Complete Forms</h2>

<p>When I imagine each segment in 3D, it becomes easier to render or shade later. For instance, if I’ve drawn the shoulder as an egg, I can practice shading a single egg to improve my light and shadow skills.</p>

<h2>Next Steps</h2>

<p>Now that I have a torso structure, I’m ready to <strong>attach the legs</strong>. I’ll keep building toward a full pose and, eventually, explore how to <strong>light and shade these forms</strong>.</p>
