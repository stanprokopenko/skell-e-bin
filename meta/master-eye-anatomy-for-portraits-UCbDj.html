<p>In this lesson, we're going to work on putting in the features of the eye. We'll cover the eye itself, the surrounding fat, how the eye is held in place, and then move on to the nose, cheek, mouth, and lower jaw area. Let's start with the eye.</p>

<h2>Eye Placement</h2>

<p>When dealing with the eye, think about the placement of the large form. Here are some simple ways to approach it:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Relational Measurements</strong>: Use the wing of the nose to find the corner of the eye. This is a common relational measurement.</li>

<li><strong>Corner of the Mouth</strong>: A rough approximation of where the corner of the mouth is can help indicate the center of the eye.</li>

<li><strong>Triangulation</strong>: Use these reference points to triangulate the eye's position. This helps in getting a rough placement.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Canthral Ligament and Tarsus Plates</h2>

<p>The eye is held in place by the canthral ligament, which can be seen as a boxy area. Here's what you need to know:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Canthral Ligament</strong>: This ligament attaches to the inside of the temple and holds the eye in place.</li>

<li><strong>Tarsus Plates</strong>: These are the eyelids, which are planar and sharp. They create highlights at corners and intersections.</li>

<li><strong>Highlights and Corners</strong>: Always look for highlights around the lid or the intersection to the eye. These are points of texture or corners.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Eye Tilt and Design</h2>

<p>The tilt of the eye is crucial in creating a specific look. Here's how to think about it:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Axis of the Eye</strong>: The eye's axis can change from low to high or high to low. This affects the appearance and can be used to assign beauty.</li>

<li><strong>Designing the Eye</strong>: Start with the canthral ligament and tarsus plates. Think about the form intersection and how the tarsus plate wraps around the eye.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Surrounding Fat</h2>

<p>Fat around the eye cushions and protects it. Here are the different types of fat to consider:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Nasal Fat</strong>: Located at the inside corner, pinched down by the canthral ligament.</li>

<li><strong>Pre-Tarsus Fat</strong>: Rare fat that lives on the tarsus plate of the eyelid.</li>

<li><strong>Lateral Fat</strong>: Located on the outside edge.</li>

<li><strong>Roof Fat</strong>: Located above the eye, contributing to the socket's form.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Impact of Aging</h2>

<p>Aging affects the appearance of the eye in several ways:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Orbital Septum</strong>: Weakening of this seal causes fat to herniate against the skin, creating lines and impressions.</li>

<li><strong>Fat Herniation</strong>: This process creates a more aged appearance as gravity pulls down the fat.</li>

<li><strong>Specific Examples</strong>: Look at how aging changes the eye's appearance, such as the softening of the tarsus plate and the movement of fat.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Practical Drawing Tips</h2>

<p>Here are some tips to help you draw the eye more effectively:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>S-Curves and Ribbons</strong>: Use these to understand the eye socket's form. Think of the socket as a twisting ribbon.</li>

<li><strong>Asymmetry</strong>: The eye is asymmetrical, with the peak of the upper lid closer to the nose and the peak of the lower lid closer to the ear.</li>

<li><strong>Different Perspectives and Ages</strong>: Practice drawing the eye in different perspectives and ages to understand the form better.</li>

<li><strong>Organic Details</strong>: Use organic details like the eyebrow to suggest depth and complexity. Hooking the eyebrow can indicate a plane change.</li>

</ul>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p>We've covered the key points of drawing the eye, including its placement, the canthral ligament and tarsus plates, surrounding fat, the impact of aging, and practical drawing tips. Practice these techniques to improve your understanding and ability to draw realistic eyes.</p>
