<p>We're back with Season 2 of the Draftsmen Podcast! In this series, we're diving deep into the topic of art school. Many aspiring artists wonder whether they should attend art school or find alternative paths. It's a complicated decision with many layers. Art school can be good for some people and not for others. In this episode, we'll explore the <strong>pros of going to art school</strong> and why they still hold value today.</p>

<h2>Why Art Schools Still Exist</h2>

<p>Despite criticisms and debates about the effectiveness of art schools, they continue to thrive. Even with negative talk and viral content discouraging attendance, enrollments are increasing. Art schools exist because they offer something that many students and parents believe is essential for a successful career in the arts.</p>

<h2>Pros of Going to Art School</h2>

<h3>Family Ritual</h3>

<p>One of the reasons to go to art school is the <strong>emotional and ceremonial aspect</strong>. Moving away from home, attending college, and starting a new chapter in life is a significant family ritual. It's a time when we step into independence, make lifelong friends, and begin our professional journeys. This ritual can be important for personal growth and is often celebrated by family and friends.</p>

<p>However, not everyone experiences this the same way. For example, Stan didn't move away for art school; he stayed with his parents and attended a local school. This situation motivated him differently, pushing him to strive for independence in his own way.</p>

<h3>Mentorship</h3>

<p>Art school provides access to <strong>mentorship</strong>, which can be challenging to find elsewhere. Having a mentor means getting personal feedback, guidance, and support from experienced professionals. Mentors can offer encouragement, help with the emotional side of learning, and contribute to our development as artists.</p>

<h3>Community</h3>

<p>Being part of an <strong>artistic community</strong> is a significant advantage of art school. We're surrounded by peers who share our interests and passions. This environment fosters collaboration, inspiration, and mutual support. These relationships often continue into our professional lives, providing a network of contacts and lifelong friends.</p>

<h3>Networking</h3>

<p><strong>Networking</strong> begins on day one at art school. The connections we make with classmates, teachers, and professionals can open doors to opportunities in the future. Networking isn't limited to school; it can also happen online or at events. But being in a physical space with like-minded individuals can make networking more accessible.</p>

<h3>Equipment and Resources</h3>

<p>Art schools offer access to <strong>equipment and resources</strong> that might be expensive or difficult to obtain on our own. This includes studios, tools, models, libraries, and specialized software. Having these resources at our disposal allows us to practice and improve our skills without significant personal investment.</p>

<h3>Structure</h3>

<p>The <strong>structure</strong> provided by art school can be crucial for some students. Schools offer deadlines, assignments, and accountability. This environment helps us stay motivated and disciplined, mirroring the professional world's demands. For those who need external guidance to stay on track, this structure can be beneficial.</p>

<p>However, there's a debate about whether structure is always necessary. Some argue that being self-motivated and creating our own structure is more valuable, especially if we aim to be freelancers or entrepreneurs.</p>

<h3>Internships</h3>

<p>Art schools often provide access to <strong>internships</strong>, which can lead to professional opportunities. Internships allow us to gain real-world experience, make industry connections, and sometimes even secure job offers. Some companies offer internships only to students enrolled in art schools, making this a unique advantage.</p>

<p>For example, Stan secured an internship at Sony Online Entertainment right after high school. Although he realized that working in a traditional office environment wasn't for him, the internship helped him understand his career preferences and gain valuable experience.</p>

<h3>Degree</h3>

<p>Finally, many students attend art school to obtain a <strong>degree</strong>. A degree can be essential for certain career paths and is often valued by employers and parents alike. While the degree itself may not guarantee success in the arts, it can be a critical component for some people, providing validation and meeting professional requirements.</p>

<p>Art school offers many advantages, from mentorship and community to resources and structure. It's important to consider these pros when deciding whether to attend. In upcoming episodes, we'll delve deeper into each of these topics and also explore the cons of art school. Whether we choose to attend or not, understanding what art school provides can help us make informed decisions about our artistic journeys.</p>
