<p>In this video, I'm going through some examples of how I study gesture from master images. I've included historical figures like <strong>Michelangelo</strong>, <strong>Peter Paul Rubens</strong>, and <strong>Rodin</strong>, as well as contemporary artists whose work I find engaging.</p>

<p>My goal is to look at how figures are posed using this technique to connect with their position and body language.</p>

<h2>Observing Master Drawings</h2>

<p>When I examine master drawings like those of Michelangelo, I enjoy seeing how often something has been <strong>reposed or repositioned</strong>. For example, why is a forearm drawn slightly more extended on one side? Or why is a calf emphasized more in one area? These components contribute to the <strong>gesture</strong>, <strong>posing</strong>, and <strong>body language</strong>.</p>

<h2>Applying Our Techniques</h2>

<p>Using the step-by-step methods we've learned, I apply the same lines to think about these positions. I start with the <strong>cervical</strong> and <strong>thoracic</strong> regions, noting the stretching or leaning of the figure. I observe how the rib cage feels like it's leaning toward us, creating a <strong>pinch forward</strong>. This leads to details like the oblique fat coming out as the hip raises.</p>

<h2>Analyzing Weight and Movement</h2>

<p>I consider where the weight is placed, perhaps on a specific leg, and how that affects the <strong>femur's angle</strong>. All of this builds up to getting comfortable with the approach and learning how other artists pose and position figures. This allows us to start creating our own.</p>

<h2>Learning from Invented Poses</h2>

<p>Many of these master drawings are <strong>invented</strong>. While there might have been some loose reference, artists like Michelangelo often composed figures without models. By studying how they use weight and pose figures, we can break down gestures into the arms and other body parts.</p>

<h2>Observing Artistic Choices</h2>

<p>I notice how an elbow pushes back and then forward again, or how a shoulder comes up to create a nice rhythm off the thoracic region. These observations might be different from drawing from a photograph because I'm learning about the artist's aesthetic for arranging a body.</p>

<h2>Drawing Straight-On Gestures</h2>

<p>One common question I get is how to draw gestures that are <strong>straight on</strong>. These poses have less side-to-side movement, but there's still <strong>asymmetry</strong>, it's just in perspective. The pelvis might pull forward while the rib cage pulls back, which creates <strong>3D asymmetry</strong>.</p>

<h2>Challenges with Complex Poses</h2>

<p>Some poses are challenging due to the amount of <strong>folding</strong> and overlapping forms. I find it helpful to push parts out to create open negative space. By observing how the artist organizes limbs and the subtle weight shifts, we can interpret and take inspiration without copying exactly.</p>

<h2>Master Copy vs. Interpretation</h2>

<p>In doing a master copy, I'm not copying as much as interpreting and seeing what I can take from how the figures are organized. Unless you're focusing on picking up hatching techniques, it's not necessary to replicate every detail.</p>

<h2>Hatching as Extension of Rhythm</h2>

<p>I noticed that in Michelangelo's work, the <strong>hatching</strong> emphasizes the larger <strong>rhythms</strong> of the body parts. The hatching continues the rhythmic play of curves, and even the lighting technique becomes an extension of these rhythmic forces.</p>

<h2>Studying Comic Art</h2>

<p>Switching from Michelangelo to <strong>Rob Liefeld</strong>, I explore how it's fun to mix it up and learn from different genres. <strong>Everyone has something to teach you</strong>.</p>

<h3>Understanding Comic Gestures</h3>

<p>In comic art, the idea is often about action, <strong>"smacking in the face with action." ** Artists like </strong>Jim Lee<strong>, </strong>Todd McFarlane<strong>, and </strong>Rob Liefeld** brought more extreme poses and distortions, compared to the classical, statuesque poses of earlier Marvel artists.</p>

<h3>Excess and Baroque Styles</h3>

<p>The Image Comics artists are <strong>Baroque</strong> in style, emphasizing excess hatching, explosions, and muscles at the expense of form, composition, and proportion. This is something to learn from, and it's totally valid.</p>

<h2>Analyzing Gesture in Comics</h2>

<p>I look at a drawing of <strong>Deadpool</strong> and consider what's happening in the gesture. There's an excessive use of <strong>foreshortening</strong> and collapse of space.</p>

<h3>Dealing with Foreshortening</h3>

<p>To interpret figures with foreshortening, I adjust the length of lines and increase <strong>wrapping lines</strong> to summarize the difference in space. If the wrapping line for a neck was one way, for a foreshortened figure, the wrapping line would open up to indicate depth.</p>

<h2>Gesture in Composition</h2>

<p>I consider how <strong>compositions have a skeleton</strong>, with horizontal, vertical, and diagonal axes. Accentuating these axes gives different qualities.</p>

<h3>Diagonals and Excitement</h3>

<p>In comics, there's a lot of emphasis on <strong>diagonals</strong> because they create excitement and movement. Even the frame organization can have gesture.</p>

<h2>Avoiding Cropping at Halves</h2>

<p>In comic art, there's often <strong>excessive cropping</strong>. I usually try to avoid cropping at halves or joints, which is the classical approach. Cropping at thirds feels more intentional and less abrupt.</p>

<h2>Inventing Poses from Imagination</h2>

<p>A good way to start inventing is to take a pose you find interesting and try to draw it from a different angle. For example, what would the character look like jumping away from us? This helps increase my ability to invent and use this approach from different perspectives.</p>

<h2>Being Critical and Personal Preferences</h2>

<p>I'm open to being critical and recognizing things I might not like. For example, in comics, people often lack necks and have exaggerated musculature.</p>

<h3>Body Language in Comics</h3>

<p>I observe that in comics, characters often have <strong>high shoulders</strong> and <strong>low heads</strong> to look more powerful or intimidating. Their bodies may close in, adopting threatening or defensive stances. Recognizing these stylistic choices can influence how we depict figures.</p>

<h2>Personal Learning and Preferences</h2>

<p>It's important to understand why I like someone's work and what I might do differently. The lessons you take will be personal, and that's a good thing.</p>

<h2>Considering Composition and Cropping</h2>

<p>I think about how classical imagery is respectful of the frame, creating a barrier between the viewer and the depicted world. Comics often break that barrier with cropping and abrupt points, inviting the viewer into the space, creating immersion in a different way.</p>

<h2>Analyzing Action Poses</h2>

<p>I look at a comic panel where a character is throwing a punch. I feel that the action could be clearer, so I consider how to adjust the pose to suggest the punch more effectively.</p>

<h2>Expressing Personal Ideas</h2>

<p>Part of my reason for inventing is to express my own ideas. By analyzing and reimagining poses, I can explore different ways to communicate something that I appreciate or want to convey.</p>
