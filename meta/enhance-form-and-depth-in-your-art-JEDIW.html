<p>We've reached the stage where our sketch is complete, values are established, and colors are blocked in. Now, it's time to <strong>refine the piece</strong>, keeping an eye on our values and ensuring every decision is logical and in context with the surrounding shapes. We don't want to add specular highlights randomly just because they look cool. Instead, we need to consider <strong>where the light source is</strong> and why we're placing certain values, lights, and colors in specific places.</p>

<h2>Adjusting the Background</h2>

<p>To make the portrait more visually interesting, I like to <strong>spice up the background</strong>. On the background layer, I might adjust the hue, saturation, and brightness to find a color that complements the subject. For instance, a vibrant yellow-orange, inspired by school buses, can make the piece pop.</p>

<h2>Adding Color Variations</h2>

<p>With our values in place, we can start <strong>playing around with more adventurous color notes</strong>. I enjoy adding color variations, especially in the darkest darks, to create depth and interest. Using the <strong>Filthy Plugin</strong>, I experiment with hue shifts and add subtle color variations while keeping the same value. This plugin allows me to add different hues without altering the overall value structure, making it easier to introduce new colors without affecting the balance of the piece.</p>

<h2>Refining Shapes and Edges</h2>

<p>At this stage, I take time to <strong>fix any areas that look messy</strong>. I clean up the outlines and refine the shapes to reduce visual noise. This might involve adjusting the edges, smoothing transitions, or erasing unnecessary strokes. I may also merge layers to simplify the workflow and focus on refining the overall composition.</p>

<h2>Experimenting with Lighting</h2>

<p>I like to <strong>experiment with different lighting effects</strong> to enhance the form. For example, adding a softer rim light on the opposite side can balance the harsh rim light already in place. Using tools like the lasso or smudge tool, I can quickly test out how additional lights impact the piece. It's important to consider the <strong>fall-off of values</strong> and ensure that any new lighting makes sense within the context of the scene.</p>

<h2>Checking Values in Grayscale</h2>

<p>Switching the image to <strong>black and white</strong> helps me assess the values without the distraction of color. This allows me to see if the composition works from a value perspective. I might adjust the background with a gradient to make the subject stand out more. Looking at the values in grayscale helps identify areas that need more contrast or refinement.</p>

<h2>Fine-Tuning Details</h2>

<p><strong>Zooming out</strong> to view the piece as a whole is crucial. It helps me see what needs to be tweaked. For instance, I might notice that the hair needs more sheen or that certain areas require more light or shadow. I add subtle highlights and shadows where needed, being careful not to over-detail since the final piece will not be viewed up close.</p>

<h2>Adjusting Colors and Mood</h2>

<p>I <strong>experiment with different background colors</strong> and saturation levels to see how they affect the mood of the piece. Adjusting the hue can tie elements together and enhance the overall feeling. It's a balancing act between saturation, lightness, and color harmony. Sometimes, changing the background to a cooler purple or blue can complement the subject better than the original color.</p>

<h2>Final Touches</h2>

<p>In the final stages, I focus on <strong>refining any remaining issues</strong>. This might involve adjusting the neck's proportions, adding flyaway hairs, or enhancing facial expressions. It's important to <strong>take breaks</strong> and view the piece at different sizes or on different devices to gain a fresh perspective. Exporting the image to my phone allows me to see it at a smaller size and spot areas that need improvement.</p>

<p>I also recommend staying zoomed out when making final adjustments. It prevents getting lost in unnecessary details, and it ensures the overall composition reads well. Remember, it's a back-and-forth process, so don't be afraid to make changes as you see fit.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p>Refining a digital portrait is not a quick process. It's about making continuous adjustments and experimenting until you are satisfied with the result. Sometimes, I prefer to <strong>go straight to color</strong> instead of starting with values first. This method I've shown is just one way to approach it. <strong>Give it a try, you might like it</strong>. If not, take the bits and pieces that are useful to you, and run with them.</p>
