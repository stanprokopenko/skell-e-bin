<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>Hello and welcome! In this first chapter, I want to walk you through the materials I like to use. It’s quite simple. I mostly stick to <strong>black pens</strong>, a <strong>good sketchbook</strong>, and a few <strong>markers</strong> or <strong>gouache</strong>. Let’s explore these items in detail.</p>

<h2>Sketchbooks</h2>

<p>I prefer a <strong>moleskin</strong> with <strong>thicker paper</strong> (look for 165-gram, 111-page versions). The cover color can vary, and some versions are labeled blue or white. The key is the thick paper because I often smudge and use gouache. If the paper is too thin, it can tear or warp.</p>

<p>I carry a sketchbook everywhere. It inevitably gets beat up, but it’s worth it since I never know when I’ll have a few minutes to capture a quick idea. Even rushed sketches can capture energy and life, which I can refine later.</p>

<p>Other sketchbooks can also work, as long as the pages are sturdy. For example, I have one made with very thick paper that handles smudging and marking well. Sometimes I even use <strong>stone paper</strong>, which lets you lift values and blend gouache in interesting ways. I’ve even used a <strong>photo album</strong> as a sketchbook, because the paper is thick enough to handle ink and paint.</p>

<h2>Pens and Markers</h2>

<p>I like to use a <strong>black pen</strong> that keeps my lines sharp. I also add color with <strong>water-based markers</strong> (like <strong>Tombow</strong>). Water-based markers don’t bleed through the page, and they don’t smear my pen lines. This way, my drawings stay intact unless I decide I actually want some bleeding as a special effect.</p>

<p>If you’re on a budget or just starting, a basic approach is to get a <strong>few grayscale markers</strong> for simple value studies. That might be a 50% gray and a 30% gray to start. Alcohol-based markers such as Copics are also popular, but they can soak through the page and sometimes smear your pen lines, so be aware of that.</p>

<h2>Paper and Gouache</h2>

<p>As you experiment with sketches, you might add <strong>gouache</strong> now and then. Heavier paper stands up to paint better. Make sure you have something that can handle moisture and smudging without tearing. The 160- or 165-gram paper weight is a good standard if you plan on mixing pen lines with light washes of paint or ink.</p>

<p>Those are my main materials: a <strong>heavier paper sketchbook</strong>, a <strong>pen</strong>, and maybe a few <strong>markers or gouache</strong>. That’s all you need to get started. Next, we’ll dive into the basics of sketching shapes. Grab your favorite pen, and let’s begin!</p>
