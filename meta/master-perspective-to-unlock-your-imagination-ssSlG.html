<p>Welcome to a course that demystifies perspective without causing brain damage. You'll learn the secrets of how artists turn a flat surface into a deep, immersive world. Discover what <strong>bodies and buildings have in common</strong>, and how perspective applies to everything around you.</p>

<h2>Why Perspective Matters</h2>

<h3>Not Just for Boxes and Buildings</h3>

<p>You may know how to draw boxes in one, two, or three-point perspective, which helps you render city streets and buildings. But there is more. <strong>Perspective is not only about boxes and buildings</strong> - it applies to everything in the world.</p>

<p>Watch how a box can become many things: something boxy, or something boxy with a bit of cylindrical form. A sphere is the basic form of countless objects. Understanding these basics opens up endless possibilities.</p>

<h2>The Challenge of Learning Perspective</h2>

<h3>Few Artists Master Perspective</h3>

<p>Many artists find perspective challenging, and few truly master it. I hoped to learn it in college to draw buildings like this, but couldn't find any teachers who knew it. Back then, resources were scarce, and learning perspective was hard.</p>

<p>I once had a job illustrating a round platform with stair steps in front, side, and three-quarter views. I didn't have any idea how to do it. That's when I realized <strong>I needed to learn perspective</strong> if I was going to do this for a living.</p>

<h3>Recognizing Your Need for Perspective</h3>

<p>How do you know if you need perspective? Consider how you hope to draw:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>If you work flat</strong>, like a graphic designer, or if you paint non-representationally, focusing on pattern and abstract design, not form and space, perspective won't help you much.</li>

<li><strong>If you just copy what you see</strong>, you don't need perspective for that.</li>

</ul>

<p>But if you want to create original work from your imagination, perspective is essential.</p>

<h2>Learning to Draw, Not Just Copy</h2>

<h3>The Story of the Proud Youth</h3>

<p>A proud youth proved he could draw accurately from observation. But it took a lot of time, and he found it difficult to capture moving subjects. He bought a camera, which took less time and captured moving subjects beautifully. He copied the photos and beheld drawings that looked a lot like the photos.</p>

<p>Eventually, he discovered that processing a photo created an impressive picture with attractive blotch marks all over it. <strong>"I have created art,"</strong> he thought.</p>

<p>His father objected, questioning whether pushing buttons on a computer or copying what's in front of him truly manifested his creative self. His mother joined in, urging him to do something original.</p>

<p>So, the youth grudgingly got his act together and gave it a shot, producing this:</p>

<p><em>(Imagine a less impressive drawing here.)</em></p>

<p>It pleased his parents even less. But at least he had moved beyond mere copying. Unfortunately, he didn't live long enough to reach his potential. But the spark of creativity was there, and your story may offer a more positive ending.</p>

<h3>The Lesson: Learn to Draw Creatively</h3>

<p>The lesson is to <strong>learn how to draw, not just copy</strong>. Always listen to your parents, unless they're wrong. In this case, they were right.</p>

<h2>Unlocking Your Imagination</h2>

<h3>Drawing Anything from Any Position</h3>

<p>Do you get ideas for images but find them difficult to draw? Do you have trouble drawing something in a different position from your reference and making it look right?</p>

<p>Everyone does, until they learn how. Once you know how, <strong>you can draw anything you can imagine</strong> in any position, and in all sorts of styles. When you can draw from your imagination, you can create your own worlds.</p>

<h3>Examples from Former Students</h3>

<p>Here are drawings from former students who learned just enough perspective to draw what they liked:</p>

<p><em>(Imagine examples of student work showcasing perspective.)</em></p>

<p>They started with the basics and used perspective to bring their ideas to life.</p>

<h2>What You Will Learn</h2>

<h3>Classic Perspective Techniques</h3>

<p>In this course, I'll teach you <strong>classic perspective</strong>, 600 years of Renaissance knowledge to draw like they did in the old days. We'll use 21st-century tools, but study the timeless drawing skills.</p>

<h3>Building Strong Foundations</h3>

<p>We'll begin with <strong>basics</strong>, establishing strong foundations before moving on to developed perspective and complex worlds. I'll give you assignments that you can work on lightly or heavily. If you carry through with them, <strong>you will gain the skills to invent</strong>. That's what this is about.</p>

<p>I'll explain every step as simply as possible. <strong>Perspective is not easy</strong>, but we'll make it as easy as we can, and useful for what you want to draw. And you may find it fun, <strong>perspective problems are basically puzzles</strong>.</p>

<h2>Studying the Masters</h2>

<h3>The Treasure Hunt Project</h3>

<p>If we want to master a skill, we can start by studying highly skilled masters. <strong>Your first project</strong> is a Treasure Hunt:</p>

<ol>

<li><strong>Gather your favorite pictures</strong>.</li>

<li><strong>Sort out the ones that showcase perspective</strong>.</li>

</ol>

<p>For example, here's a study that Leonardo da Vinci drew, and he never intended the world to see it. That's part of why I love it, no showing off. The lines go down as easy as breathing. From a perspective point of view, it's quite simple, almost entirely three sets of lines. *500 years ago. *</p>

<p><em>(Imagine Leonardo's study here.)</em></p>

<p>Pieter de Vries drew environments like little stages where stories could play out. <em>400 years ago.</em></p>

<p><em>(Imagine de Vries' work here.)</em></p>

<p>Winsor McCay drew thousands of comic strip panels where stories played out. <em>100 years ago.</em> He knew perspective. <strong>What he used here, you will learn in this course.</strong></p>

<p><em>(Imagine Winsor McCay's work here.)</em></p>

<h3>Identifying Perspective Problems</h3>

<p>Also, collect potential perspective problems to be solved later, questions you have, puzzles you care about. Examples include,</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>How do arches get smaller as they go away?</strong> Is there a science to that? Yes, and it's not that difficult.</li>

<li>**Can you manipulate that science and make it look credible? ** Yes! In one way, that's the whole aim of this course, to learn enough perspective to invent and experiment as you like.</li>

<li><strong>How do you take a picture of something you're looking up at and draw it as if you're looking down at it?</strong> You will learn that!</li>

<li><strong>How do kids on a merry-go-round in a perspective view clump up against the edges and spread out in the middle?</strong> Is there a way to draw that from imagination and from different points of view and keep it believable? <strong>There is!</strong></li>

</ul>

<p>If you want to do that or anything like it, <strong>you're in the right place</strong>.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p>If you are an absolute beginner, I'll do all I can to make it easy to understand. Even if you're a pro, you may enjoy it. With <strong>600 years of perspective</strong>, and more tools than the Renaissance artists imagined, you can learn to create compelling, realistic drawings.</p>

<p>Join me in this journey of perspective, and use these skills for the rest of your life.</p>
