<h2>What Are Clangers?</h2>

<p>Clangers are <strong>experimental marks</strong>, those spontaneous sketches we create without worrying about the outcome. They're the figures we draw with <strong>no care in the world</strong>, free from the pressure of perfection. By embracing clangers, we allow ourselves the freedom to <strong>explore and experiment</strong>. This leads to unexpected breakthroughs in our art.</p>

<h2>The Magic of Mileage</h2>

<p>One of the most stultifying things for any artist is expecting a good drawing to happen by magic. But the real magic lies in the <strong>mileage</strong>, the sheer amount of drawing we do. By filling pages with clangers, we give ourselves the grace to <strong>draw without fear</strong> of criticism. This practice builds our <strong>hand memory</strong> and leads to confident strokes that were not intended to be anything other than an experiment.</p>

<h2>Techniques for Drawing Clangers</h2>

<p>When I'm drawing, I focus solely on the art, ignoring anything that might impede me. With my Conté à Paris pencil, I constantly <strong>lift my fingers for pointed lines</strong> and <strong>place my palm down for broad strokes</strong>. Broad strokes are for <strong>heavy or thick things</strong>, and understanding this is the beginning of developing your own style.</p>

<h3>Using Shapes and Rhythms</h3>

<p>I think about the <strong>broad back of the skull</strong>, emphasizing how it feels big and heavy at the back. I use <strong>rhythm</strong> to connect shapes, allowing the drawing to flow naturally. For example, I consider how the <strong>rib cage</strong> connects to the <strong>pelvis</strong> and how the limbs extend from the body. This approach turns drawing into a <strong>subconscious engine</strong> that fuels creativity.</p>

<h2>Overcoming the Fear of the Blank Page</h2>

<p>Starting on a blank page can be intimidating. That's why I love to <strong>fill a page with clangers</strong>. By doing so, I remove the fear of making mistakes. This page becomes a playground where I can explore ideas, without worrying about the outcome. Remember, these drawings are for you, <strong>no one else needs to see them</strong>.</p>

<h2>The Power of the Gestural Hand</h2>

<p>I draw using the <strong>gestural hand</strong>, which involves using my arm and shoulder to create fluid lines. This method allows me to move freely across the paper, capturing the essence of the figure with <strong>confidence and movement</strong>. The gestural hand is essential for creating dynamic and lively drawings.</p>

<h3>Avoiding the Detail Hand</h3>

<p>The <strong>detail hand</strong>, which relies on small, tight movements from the fingers, can limit the fluidity of your lines. By focusing too much on details, you risk losing the overall gesture and energy of the drawing. Embracing the gestural hand helps maintain a balance between <strong>structure and gesture</strong>.</p>

<h2>Observing and Creating Characters</h2>

<p>Characters are all around us. By observing people in everyday life, we can find endless inspiration for our art. Each person has unique features and expressions that can be captured in our drawings. Whether it's the way someone stands or a particular gesture, these observations help us create <strong>diverse and compelling characters</strong>.</p>

<h2>The Importance of Practice and Experimentation</h2>

<p>Every drawing, whether successful or not, contributes to your growth as an artist. Don't be afraid to make mistakes, <strong>that's where learning happens</strong>. Each clanger teaches you something new, and over time, you'll see improvement in your work. The key is to keep drawing, keep experimenting, and keep pushing your boundaries.</p>

<p>Embrace the freedom of drawing clangers. Fill pages with experimental marks, and don't worry about the outcome. By doing so, you build confidence, develop your hand memory, and unlock creativity you did not know you had. Remember, the real magic is in the mileage, so keep drawing and enjoy the journey.</p>
