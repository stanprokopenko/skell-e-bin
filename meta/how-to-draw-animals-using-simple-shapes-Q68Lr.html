<p>Hey, everybody. We've looked at using simple shapes to draw animal portraits. As a bonus lesson, I've invited my friend Aaron Blaise, the master of animals and the Creature Art Teacher, to show you how he uses simple shapes when designing and animating creatures. I think it's important to know how these techniques can help you in the future. This video is meant to serve as inspiration. There won't be an animation assignment after this. Just watch and enjoy.</p>

<h2>Breaking Down Animals into Simple Shapes</h2>

<p>Hey, everybody. Aaron Blaise here, and I'm going to talk to you today about how you can break down animal anatomy into simple shapes and forms. It really helps. Many people try to draw animals, whether at the zoo or drawing their dog or cat, and they're not familiar with the anatomy. They get hung up on it. Yes, you should know a little bit of anatomy eventually, but you can <strong>break down those complicated forms into much simpler forms</strong>.</p>

<h2>Drawing a Dog with Simple Shapes</h2>

<p>Let's take a dog, for example. I think about the <strong>head, neck, shoulders, body, and hips</strong> as very simple forms that we can create.</p>

<h3>Starting with the Head</h3>

<p>I usually start with a circle and then square that off. Think of a dog's head like this wedge-shaped square. Then, off of that, you can draw the snout. It's straight on top and comes back, feeding into the head.</p>

<h3>Finding the Rhythm and Flow</h3>

<p>I'm always thinking about the <strong>rhythm</strong>. What I mean by rhythm is the flow through the body. Once I've established the head, I want to find that flow, find that rhythm through the body. I think about the spine feeding into the tail and how that flows. Starting with the head, I find that flow right through the body. This is the rhythm, the gesture, whatever you want to call it.</p>

<h3>Building the Body Parts</h3>

<p>Once I find that, I build all the parts right onto that line I've just drawn through.</p>

<h4>Drawing the Neck</h4>

<p>I come down and draw the neck. The neck is the next thing I think about. The neck has flexibility. Another thing to think about is that the <strong>head, neck, shoulders, trunk of the body, and hips</strong> go from <strong>rigid</strong>, <strong>flexible</strong>, <strong>rigid</strong>, <strong>flexible</strong>, to <strong>rigid</strong> again. That really helps when you're trying to find gestures and poses. Think of the neck as a tube, like a nice cylinder coming off the back of the head.</p>

<h4>Drawing the Shoulders and Front Legs</h4>

<p>Then we get into the shoulders. That tends to be kind of like this box shape coming off the body. Keep your shapes simple. Don't get caught up with the anatomy. Just think about the shapes. I'm going to have that come down into the front legs. Once again, back to tubes. There's a long tube coming off this box that we've just created, down into the feet.</p>

<h4>Drawing the Body and Hips</h4>

<p>Once we've got the shoulders established, we go into the next section. Remember, I want to <strong>follow this flow</strong>. That's important. You'll notice that everything is working off of that. I want that rhythm to be echoed in all the shapes that I'm creating. We've got a little curve in the back and a curve in the rib cage and the belly. Once again, it's another tube. Think of the tube that comes up to the hips, with another tube right there.</p>

<p>We come down to the hips, and we've got another box, just like so.</p>

<h4>Drawing the Back Legs</h4>

<p>For the back legs, I always think of them like a <strong>chicken leg</strong>. Everyone is familiar with a chicken leg. If you can draw a chicken leg, it looks like a teardrop. You just adjust it a little bit, put a little foot on it, and there's your back leg. We're going to draw that chicken leg off that box. It's going to come back just like that, and then you can put a foot on it.</p>

<h4>Adding the Tail</h4>

<p>Then, coming off of here, there's that <strong>tail</strong>.</p>

<h3>Adding Details</h3>

<p>Once you get those shapes down, you can add whatever detail you want. But this is where it starts. <strong>Think about those simple shapes</strong>: the box for the head, the tube for the neck, the box for the shoulders, the tube for the body, and another box for the hips going into those back legs. You can start moving the character.</p>

<h2>Moving and Posing the Simple Shapes</h2>

<p>My background is animation, and one of the things we purposely did when we designed our characters was to base them on simple shapes that can be attached—one shape to another—so that when it came time to animate, all we had to do was <strong>move those simple shapes around</strong>, and then it was just about attaching details to that.</p>

<h3>Changing the Pose</h3>

<p>Let me show you what I mean. If I want to raise his leg, let's have him bring his paw up. All I have to do is think about this box shape and move it up here. Now I've got it moved up just a little bit there. Here, I can bring that up. Once again, simple shapes. Bring the paw down like so. I'm just thinking about that simple shape coming up.</p>

<p>Same with the back leg. If we come back here and I want to bring that back leg up, maybe compress it like he's stepping over a log. Right here, I know there's a knee there, the corner of that block we've created that represents a knee. All I have to do is, once again, thinking about that shape, bring that up, bring this over here. Now we're making another block, just a different block right here. That knee comes up. Remember the chicken leg, and then there's a foot right here.</p>

<h3>Moving the Head</h3>

<p>You can take those simple shapes that you've created and then move them around. It makes it a lot easier to do that if you think in simple shapes. Same thing here. If you want to bring that head down, the block of the skull that we've created, all you have to do is bring that tube down as well. Now you can start creating poses in this way, very simply, by attaching these shapes in different ways.</p>

<h2>Adapting Shapes to Different Animals: Drawing a Bear</h2>

<p>Let's go to another one. I want to show you how you can take those same shapes and <strong>change those proportions</strong> to create other animals. For instance, let's draw a bear. I've drawn lots of bears. I directed Brother Bear, so I've done thousands and thousands of bears. Once again, in creating those bear characters, it was all about breaking those forms down—the anatomy of a real bear—down to its basic shapes.</p>

<h3>Starting with the Head</h3>

<p>Just like a dog, I start with that big head. A bear has this big head and is very blocky, right here. Big snout, a big shape. Now, dogs and bears are actually very distantly related, but they have a lot of similar shapes, just proportioned a little differently. This is similar to what we just had with the dog.</p>

<h3>Drawing the Neck and Shoulders</h3>

<p>Now we're going to get into the body. We're going to get really big and bulky. Rather than this nice, slender tube for a neck, we're going to get into a much bigger and bulkier neck. Before I do that, I want to find that gesture right through the body, just like so. Bears tend to walk with their head hanging low a little bit. Let's get that big, thick neck. Look how thick that is right there. Think about simplicity. Think about how you can take all that detail that you might see in a photo or in life and break it down to its simplest form.</p>

<p>They have <strong>big shoulders</strong>, especially grizzly bears, a big hump on their shoulders. So I'm going to get a nice big round shape up there coming down into this big upper body right there. So there's this kind of round and blocky all at the same time.</p>

<h3>Drawing the Legs and Body</h3>

<p>Here, we've got a head with that snout attached into that tube, the big thick neck, just like we did with the dog, but now it's bigger. Down into those big shoulders, let's bring this down into the front legs. On the dog, we drew these thin. On a bear, it's a big tube coming down. Think of it like this, like that—it tapers down at the bottom. Then you've got the feet here.</p>

<p>We go into this big body, and once again, I want to <strong>follow that form</strong>, remember, follow the gesture that we drew through, that rhythm. I want to follow that rhythm in here, thinking about that tube again, but now it's much bigger.</p>

<h3>Drawing the Hips and Back Legs</h3>

<p>Same thing back into the hips and the pelvis area. This is going to be a big blocky part right here. It goes down to the knee. See that big shape, just like that. Then, just like we had on the front feet, bring this down—it's a nice cylinder—coming down into those feet.</p>

<p>Bears are like people in the way their feet touch the ground, their back feet. They don't walk on their toes like a dog does with their ankle up in the air. A bear actually walks on its heel.</p>

<h3>Adding Details</h3>

<p>There you go. A little tail right there. There's the ear. Once you get those shapes down, you can create anything; you just have to know those proportions. Once you understand the proportions and those simple shapes, and you start putting them together, there's nothing that you can't create.</p>

<h3>Changing the Pose</h3>

<p>Now let's do the same thing we just did for the dog. If I think about taking the shape, now that little point right there is going to be his shoulder. If I want to pull that up and just adjust the shape just a little bit, then I can take that tube, move it this way, just like that. You can change the pose, just like that.</p>

<p>Same thing back here like we did with the dog's leg. Bring that up like that, change that tube. Then you can almost have him start to animate. You can start moving the character across the screen. That's what I think about when I'm drawing animals and breaking those shapes down.</p>

<h2>Building Strong Drawings with Simple Shapes</h2>

<p>You can see that square, that tube, that triangle, whatever it might be that makes up whatever animal you're drawing. If you can do that, if you can break it down, then that's the <strong>foundation</strong>. That's what's going to create a really strong drawing. If you can get that down, then you can build on top of it.</p>

<h2>Rotating Shapes into 3D Space</h2>

<p>Now we're going to start thinking about, instead of a circle, it's going to be a <strong>sphere</strong>. Let me show you what I mean.</p>

<h3>Drawing the Bear's Head as a Sphere</h3>

<p>If I start with a bear's head and I think about that bear's head as a sphere—let's say it's a sphere this time—and I want to draw a center line, I can just draw that simple shape of that muzzle. Now, it's going to be a shape like this, and that shape is going to fit right on the bear's head.</p>

<p>I'll show you one more. So I'm thinking about that same thing. As long as I know where that center line is, now I can move that head up here, and we've got simple, simple shapes.</p>

<p>Thanks again, Aaron. You guys saw at the end there, Aaron rotated those 2D shapes into 3D space. I know for many of you that just looks like witchcraft right now. But don't worry. We'll learn everything about what it takes to do that in the perspective section coming up. I hope you guys enjoyed this lesson. I'll see you next time.</p>
