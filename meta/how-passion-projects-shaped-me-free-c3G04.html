<h2>What's in Premium?</h2>

<p>In this lesson, we explore how engaging in personal projects can accelerate your growth as an artist. I share insights from my journey, including applying techniques learned from workshops with Max Turner and Glenn Vilppu. We'll discuss experimenting with different drawing methods like textured papers, gesture sketches, blending stumps, cross-hatching, and working with toned paper. You'll see how value studies, composition planning, and applying anatomy knowledge to creative projects can enhance your skills. Reflecting on past work, we'll highlight the importance of fearless exploration and continuous personal development in art.</p>
