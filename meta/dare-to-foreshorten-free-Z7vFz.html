<h2>What's in Premium?</h2>

<p>In this lesson, you'll learn how to embrace <strong>foreshortening</strong> using simple shapes like blocks and arrows. We'll start by understanding <strong>orthographic views</strong> to grasp object dimensions. You'll see how fitting complex forms into simple shapes simplifies foreshortening.</p>

<p>We'll cover techniques like drawing <strong>transparent forms</strong>, using <strong>scaffolding</strong> and <strong>extrusion</strong>, and connecting dots to complete foreshortened forms. You'll practice foreshortening on different axes, compare curved and blocky objects, and apply these concepts to anatomy.</p>

<p>We'll also explore dealing with diagonals and vectors in complex forms. By starting simple and gradually introducing complexities, you'll gain confidence in drawing three-dimensional objects with accurate foreshortening.</p>
