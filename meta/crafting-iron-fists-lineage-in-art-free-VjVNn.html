<h2>What's in Premium?</h2>

<p>In the premium lesson, I dive into the creation of the Iron Fist #4 cover, sharing my process from concept to final illustration. You'll learn how I developed the idea of showcasing the lineage of Iron Fist, highlighting the heritage of heroes throughout history.</p>

<p>I explain how I pitched the concept to Marvel and how they embraced it. You'll see how I incorporated the dragon symbol and Iron Fist chi to connect the generations of warriors. I discuss working with models and reference images to capture the unique aesthetics of each Iron Fist.</p>

<p>The lesson covers my artistic choices, like balancing warm and cool colors and aiming for a Hong Kong movie poster feel with montage elements. I reflect on the importance of legacy and how it influences my work, connecting the tradition of Iron Fist to my own journey as an artist.</p>
