<h2>The Fun of Thumbnailing</h2>

<p>Thumbnailing is one of my favorite parts of the creative process. It's where I get to imagine the final image without any of the heavy lifting. By drawing small, rough sketches of the composition, I can quickly explore different ideas. I like to draw the frame myself to keep everything loose and set the tone for what I'm about to do.</p>

<h2>Focusing Attention with One-Point Perspective</h2>

<p>In my first thumbnail, I started with a cute bunny character, maybe a baby version like my son, looking at the camera. Since the bunny is the focal point, I placed him in the center. It's important for all other elements to support the focal point, both compositionally and with color.</p>

<p>One effective way to focus attention is by using <strong>one-point perspective</strong>, where all lines converge at a single point. This directs the viewer's eye to the main character. Elements like walls, sidewalks, and telephone poles can naturally create these converging lines.</p>

<h3>Using Affinity of Line</h3>

<p>The <strong>affinity of line</strong> means that the more lines pointing towards the focal point, the stronger the sense of perspective. Hard-surfaced objects like AC units are perfect for this. By aligning them correctly, they help create lines that draw attention to the main character.</p>

<h2>Considering Story and Emotion</h2>

<p>As I thumbnail, I think about the <strong>story</strong> and the <strong>emotion</strong> I want to convey. I ask myself, "Why is the character looking at the camera?" and "What kind of vibe do I want to create?" I imagined the bunny as a cute but tough little guy, a badass bunny who's in control of his surroundings.</p>

<p>To support this idea, I added elements like motorcycles and a biker gang. Perhaps the bunny is being cornered by a gang of biker cats, which adds tension and emphasizes his toughness. Their eyelines also point towards the bunny, reinforcing the focal point.</p>

<h2>Experimenting with Two-Point Perspective</h2>

<p>In my next thumbnail, I played with <strong>two-point perspective</strong>, where lines converge at two points. This can represent two different places or choices within the image. I imagined a scene where the bunny is at a crossroads, perhaps giving directions to the Saturn Donuts girl.</p>

<p>By adjusting the perspective, I included more elements like AC units and greenery, exploring a <strong>solarpunk</strong> vibe with plants and overgrowth on buildings. This creates a peaceful, slice-of-life scene that contrasts with the gritty alley of the first thumbnail.</p>

<h2>Combining Elements for a New Composition</h2>

<p>For the third thumbnail, I combined the <strong>gritty tone</strong> of the alley with the <strong>peaceful atmosphere</strong> of the solarpunk scene. I drew the bunny talking to a biker guy who looks tough but is actually friendly. This contrast adds interest and depth to the scene.</p>

<p>I considered the <strong>lighting scheme</strong> to make the characters stand out. By directing the light from a specific angle, I used shadows and highlights to emphasize the focal points.</p>

<h2>Exploring Warped Perspective</h2>

<p>In my fourth thumbnail, I indulged in a personal idea by drawing my wife and son. I wanted to capture a moment of my son learning to walk while holding our hands. To make it more dynamic, I explored a <strong>warped perspective</strong>, similar to a wide-angle lens that curves the lines.</p>

<p>This perspective allows me to see multiple planes of objects, making the composition more interesting and engaging. I filled the background with AC units and playful elements like cats riding motorcycles, adding whimsy to the scene.</p>

<p>Thumbnailing is a great way to <strong>play with ideas</strong> and figure out how to tell a story using the concepts you've been studying. It's an organic process where you draw what appeals to you and explore concepts you're interested in. Whether it's fun, attitude, or a specific emotion, getting to the essence of what you want to show is key.</p>

<p>Remember to think about how elements are <strong>lit</strong> and <strong>placed</strong> so that the lines lead the viewer to the focal point. This rough stage is all about exploring and refining ideas. Ultimately, you decide what to draw and how to tell your story.</p>

<p>I'll see you in the next one.</p>
