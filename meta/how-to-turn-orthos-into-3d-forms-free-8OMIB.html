<h2>What's in Premium?</h2>

<p>In the premium lesson, we explore the <strong>Ortho to Invented Form</strong> project, guiding you on how to transform 2D orthographic projections into inventive 3D forms. You'll learn to balance <strong>technical precision</strong> with <strong>creative exploration</strong>, ensuring your designs are both accurate and imaginative.</p>

<p>We analyze examples from student work to highlight key techniques:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Incorporating Slopes and Curves</strong>: Learn how adding slopes and curves can create dynamic forms that add depth and interest.</li>

<li><strong>Using Structural Guidelines</strong>: Understand the importance of thin wires or structural lines to accurately position and proportion your forms.</li>

<li><strong>Experimenting with Positive and Negative Space</strong>: Discover how to play with visual perception by creatively using positive and negative forms.</li>

<li><strong>Introducing Innovative Angles</strong>: Explore how tilting forms and altering angles can lead to unexpected and engaging designs.</li>

<li><strong>Applying Perspective Principles</strong>: Enhance your forms by applying perspective, adding realism and dimensionality to your work.</li>

<li><strong>Strengthening Freehand Drawing Skills</strong>: Develop your ability to perceive horizon lines and draw accurately without reliance on tools.</li>

</ul>

<p>By the end of the lesson, you'll have a deeper understanding of how to combine your technical drawing skills with creative design approaches to produce unique and compelling 3D forms.</p>
