<p>Hi everybody! I'm back to show you how to take our melted pancake shapes and turn them into dynamic rock formations. Last time, we built up an environment using basic rounded shapes. Now, let's explore how to extrude these forms and create more complex structures.</p>

<h2>Starting with the Previous Drawing</h2>

<p>Here's the drawing I did last time. I'm going to take a portion of it and focus on expanding from there. The benefit of working digitally is that I can easily reframe and adjust my composition. I've kept the horizon line in the same place, so nothing's changed in terms of perspective.</p>

<h2>Extruding Shapes from Basic Forms</h2>

<p>I like to think of this process as working in a 3D program like Maya. Imagine your drawing is a facade that you can pull and extrude. <strong>I can grab an edge and pull it out, expanding the shape into the space.</strong> For example, I can take a shape and pull it out towards the viewer or upwards into the sky.</p>

<p>When you start extruding shapes, your brain becomes more familiar with drawing organic forms in perspective. You'll create <strong>overlaps</strong> that add depth and introduce a sense of scale as elements get larger or smaller.</p>

<h3>Compositional Groupings</h3>

<p>As you work, you'll notice natural groupings forming in your composition:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Large groupings</strong></li>

<li><strong>Smaller groupings</strong></li>

<li><strong>Background groupings</strong></li>

</ul>

<p>These groupings are important because they help your eye move through the drawing and create visual interest.</p>

<h2>Techniques for Extruding Shapes</h2>

<p>To begin extruding shapes, I like to sketch lightly in red or use a light touch. Here are some techniques:</p>

<h3>Using Contour Lines</h3>

<p>Drawing contour lines over your shapes helps you visualize how the forms wrap and turn in space. <strong>Contour lines allow you to anchor where things are and make your shapes feel more credible.</strong></p>

<h3>Pulling Shapes Upwards</h3>

<p>When pulling shapes upwards, remember that as you go over the horizon line, the <strong>elliptical angles become tighter</strong>. This means you'll see less of the top plane and more of the side planes.</p>

<h3>Dealing with Tangents</h3>

<p>Be mindful of tangents, where lines touch in a way that creates awkward tension. <strong>Avoid tangents by either overlapping forms or pulling them back so they don't touch.</strong> This keeps your drawing visually clear and prevents distractions.</p>

<h2>Creating Organic Forms</h2>

<p>Now, let's loosen up and start drawing larger shapes. Don't be afraid to expand and distort your forms. <strong>Grabbing shapes and pulling them out adds dimension and interest.</strong></p>

<h3>Bending, Twisting, and Distorting</h3>

<p>You can begin to <strong>bend, twist, and distort shapes</strong>, breaking free from rigid structures. This process allows you to create more natural and dynamic rock formations.</p>

<h3>Extruding Shapes in Multiple Directions</h3>

<p>Not everything has to be locked into one direction. <strong>You can extrude shapes in multiple directions, creating arcs, overhangs, and unique formations.</strong> This adds variety to your environment and makes it more engaging.</p>

<h2>Adding Detail and Cracks</h2>

<p>Once you've established your forms, you can start adding details like cracks and splits to enhance realism.</p>

<h3>Using Cracks to Enhance Realism</h3>

<p><strong>Adding cracks and splits mimics how nature affects rock formations.</strong> Water erosion, gravity, and other natural elements cause rocks to crack and break apart. Drawing these details brings your rocks to life.</p>

<h3>Placing Rocks and Sediments</h3>

<p>Consider how gravity pulls rocks downward, causing them to tumble and pile up. <strong>Adding small, medium, and large rocks around your formations adds depth and realism.</strong></p>

<h2>Composition and Areas of Rest</h2>

<p>When adding detail, it's important to balance it with areas of rest.</p>

<h3>Importance of Areas of Detail and Rest</h3>

<p><strong>If you put too much detail everywhere, the eye doesn't know where to look, and the image can feel overwhelming.</strong> By balancing detailed areas with simpler ones, you guide the viewer's eye through the composition.</p>

<h3>Distributing Detail Strategically</h3>

<p>I like to place detail in specific areas to create visual interest. For example, I might add detail in the foreground, a bit in the midground, and leave the background simpler. <strong>This distribution helps move the eye around the piece without causing visual overload.</strong></p>

<h2>Avoiding Repetition and Flatness</h2>

<p>To keep your drawing dynamic, avoid repetitive patterns and flatness.</p>

<h3>Varying Contour Lines</h3>

<p><strong>Don't use the same repetition of patterns or contour lines</strong>, as this can flatten your drawing. Instead, vary your lines, making some wider, some smaller, to add interest and depth.</p>

<h3>Breaking Forms into Smaller Forms</h3>

<p>By <strong>breaking larger forms into smaller ones</strong>, you create complexity and realism. This could be through adding cracks, splitting edges, or extruding parts of the shape.</p>

<h2>Thinking in 3D and Developing Instinct</h2>

<p>As you work through this process, you're developing your ability to think in three dimensions. <strong>Practice helps you develop an instinct for where to add details, how to extrude shapes, and how to compose your drawing.</strong></p>

<p>Extruding shapes and adding detail brings your environment to life. <strong>By practicing these techniques, you'll become more comfortable with pulling shapes out, creating dynamic compositions, and adding realism to your drawings.</strong></p>

<p>Remember, balance is key. <strong>Areas of detail should be balanced with areas of rest</strong>, and your shapes should vary to keep the viewer engaged. Keep practicing, and you'll develop an instinctive understanding of how to create compelling rock formations.</p>

<p>Now, go draw some rocks!</p>
