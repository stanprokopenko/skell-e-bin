<p><strong>Rethinking Perspective in Drawing</strong></p>

<p>When you think of perspective, you might picture complicated grids or a 3D computer world full of lines. But you don’t always need those detailed grids to show depth in your drawings. There are much simpler tools, called <strong>depth cues</strong>, that are often overlooked but are very effective for creating a sense of form and space.</p>

<p><strong>Six Depth Cues for Indicating Depth and Form</strong></p>

<p>You can create convincing depth with six simple cues:

- Overlap

- Diminution

- Convergence

- Foreshortening

- Atmospheric Perspective

- Rendering</p>

<p>Let’s break down each one.</p>

<p><strong>Overlap</strong></p>

<p>Overlap is one of the most powerful ways to show that something is in front of something else. When one object covers part of another, the viewer immediately knows which is closer. </p>

<ul>

<li>If you overlap the left elephant over the right, the left one looks like it's in front.</li>

<li>Switch the overlap, and now the right is in front.</li>

<li>Overlap is the most foolproof depth cue you can use. It overrides the others to clearly communicate what is in front.</li>

</ul>

<p><strong>Diminution</strong></p>

<p>This cue refers to things getting smaller as they move away from you into the distance.</p>

<ul>

<li>You see it every day, people, cars, and distant objects look tiny.</li>

<li>If you draw a faraway elephant the same size as a close one, it suddenly looks gigantic.</li>

<li>Just remember: things get smaller as they recede.</li>

</ul>

<p><strong>Convergence</strong></p>

<p>When objects move away, their parallel edges appear to angle and meet at a vanishing point.</p>

<ul>

<li>In a box, the parallel edges converge towards that vanishing point.</li>

<li>This doesn’t only apply to boxes. Any form can be imagined inside a box, so you can use this principle for other shapes too.</li>

<li>The height of a standing person, their waistline, or any point on their body will converge towards this same vanishing point as they move back.</li>

<li>If you rotate a pencil, it gets shorter until it becomes just a dot at the vanishing point.</li>

<li>Boxes are incredibly helpful for visualizing how things shorten and converge as they recede.</li>

</ul>

<p><strong>Foreshortening</strong></p>

<p>Foreshortening happens when parts of objects move toward you, which makes their length appear shorter.</p>

<ul>

<li>Every 3D object will have some plane that’s being foreshortened.</li>

<li>For example, the top of a box looks much shorter when seen at an angle than if you look directly down at it.</li>

<li>If you rotate the box, different planes become foreshortened.</li>

<li>With a face, the side plane can look very thin in profile and normal when facing forward, these are all forms of foreshortening.</li>

<li>Boxes help you imagine and foreshorten the planes of any 3D object.</li>

</ul>

<p><strong>Linear and Tonal Techniques</strong></p>

<p>The first four cues, <strong>Overlap, Diminution, Convergence, and Foreshortening</strong>, are all about <strong>linear perspective</strong>. You control them using lines.</p>

<p>The last two cues use value or color instead of lines.</p>

<p><strong>Atmospheric Perspective</strong></p>

<p>Atmospheric perspective is about how air, fog, and tiny particles affect what you see as things get farther away.</p>

<ul>

<li>Objects far away have more atmosphere in front of them, which hides them.</li>

<li>The effect: things recede into a fog and become less distinct.</li>

<li>You can even apply this idea to line drawings by making lines lighter for background objects.</li>

<li>Atmospheric perspective acts as a bridge between linear perspective and tonal modeling.</li>

</ul>

<p><strong>Rendering (Tonal Modeling)</strong></p>

<p>Rendering uses value, not lines, to show depth. It’s all about using the laws of light to shade and reveal the 3D shape of something.</p>

<ul>

<li>This is purely tonal and about how you render form with shading.</li>

<li>You will learn more about this in the values and edges section.</li>

</ul>

<p><strong>Focusing on Linear Depth Cues</strong></p>

<p>For now, focus on those first four cues: <strong>Overlap, Diminution, Convergence, and Foreshortening</strong>. They are the main tools for drawing depth and form using lines. </p>

<p>In the next lesson, you’ll dive into drawing with one-point perspective and see how these linear depth cues work together in practice.</p>
