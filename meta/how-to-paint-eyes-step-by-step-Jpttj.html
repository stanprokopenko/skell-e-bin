<h2>Starting the Lay-In</h2>

<p>I'm starting my full-color rendering of the eyes, applying the knowledge and tips we've covered so far. I begin with the <strong>gesture and lay-in</strong>, focusing on the <strong>keystone shape</strong> between the eyebrows, the glabella. I rough in the <strong>eye line</strong> and adjust the <strong>tilt of the eyes</strong> to match my reference. It's important to block in the <strong>underlying spheres of the eyeballs</strong> to build three-dimensional eyelids that wrap around them.</p>

<p>I use <strong>vertical curved lines</strong> to indicate where the pupils will be on these spheres. Then, I sketch the <strong>gesture of the eyelids</strong> and erase any unnecessary construction lines. I take my time to ensure accuracy, knowing that initial lay-ins don't have to be perfect. Adjustments can always be made along the way.</p>

<h2>Understanding Eye Anatomy</h2>

<p>I pay close attention to the <strong>negative shapes</strong> surrounding the irises, as they help me place them accurately. The <strong>cornea</strong>, the lens that bulges out on top of the iris and pupil, affects the shape of the eyelids. Typically, the <strong>apex of the eyelid</strong> aligns with the center of the pupil. I notice that the pupils aren't always centered, they might favor one side depending on the perspective.</p>

<h2>Blocking in Eyelashes and Eyebrows</h2>

<p>When drawing the eyelashes, I focus on creating <strong>flat, graphic shapes</strong> instead of individual hairs. This simplifies the process and allows for more detailed rendering later. I also block in the <strong>eyebrows</strong>, treating them as solid shapes to establish a good construction drawing to work with.</p>

<h2>Preparing for Painting</h2>

<p>In Photoshop, I organize my layers by collapsing all line work into one layer and removing any white areas from erasing and painting. I <strong>label my layers</strong> for clarity. I <strong>colorize the line layer</strong>, choosing a reddish-orange hue, and set it to <strong>multiply</strong> over my wash layer.</p>

<p>I create a <strong>wash layer</strong> underneath, using a <strong>red-orange color wash</strong> to eliminate the intimidating white canvas. This wash prevents white from poking through unpainted areas and provides a mid-tone value to work from.</p>

<h2>Blocking in Local Colors</h2>

<p>I add another layer for <strong>local colors</strong>, filling in areas with flat values without worrying about gradients or shadows. I find the local color of the skin by looking at the <strong>midtones</strong> and fill the entire area. For the <strong>sclera</strong> (white of the eye), I select the flesh color and <strong>desaturate</strong> it, avoiding pure white.</p>

<p>I fill in the <strong>irises</strong> with desaturated blues and the <strong>pupils</strong> with a saturated red-orange rather than black to keep them lively. I block in the <strong>eyelashes</strong> and <strong>eyebrows</strong> as graphic shapes, and add the <strong>tear ducts</strong> with a more pinkish tone.</p>

<h2>Separating Lights and Shadows</h2>

<p>Next, I create a layer to separate the <strong>lights and darks</strong> in a graphic way, similar to comic book coloring. I select a good shadow color for the flesh and fill in the shadow areas as flat shapes. I simplify the shapes into graphic forms without focusing on gradients yet.</p>

<p>I apply the same process to the <strong>whites of the eyes</strong>, separating the light and dark areas. This step helps establish the foundational value structure of the painting.</p>

<h2>Blending and Creating Gradients</h2>

<p>I merge the layers onto a new layer (keeping the originals for selection) and use the <strong>blender tools</strong> to create soft edges and transitions. I leave <strong>cast shadows sharp</strong> to maintain variation between hard and soft edges, which adds visual interest to the painting.</p>

<h2>Adding Highlights and Dark Accents</h2>

<p>I add highlights by using <strong>cooler pinks</strong> to create variation between warms and cools, making the features pop. I adjust the opacity of the highlight layer for subtler effects. To add stronger highlights, I use lighter, desaturated blues for the brightest spots, like the tip of the nose or the edges of the eyelids.</p>

<p>For <strong>dark accents</strong>, I use <strong>saturated cadmium reds and oranges</strong> to keep the shadow areas lively. I carefully place these accents in the corners of the eyes and areas of occlusion.</p>

<h2>Refining Details</h2>

<p>Now, I move into the refining phase, adding <strong>variation in brushwork</strong>, color, and edge sharpness. I go back and forth between different areas, adding nuances and more definition. This "noodling" phase is where the painting starts to come to life.</p>

<h2>Final Touches and Tips</h2>

<p>I push the <strong>cast shadows</strong> by adding saturated colors to make them pop. I vary my brushwork, incorporating smooth gradients and textured strokes for interest. I also add a subtle <strong>secondary light source</strong>, keeping it subdued so the primary light source remains the focus.</p>

<p>Throughout the process, I focus on maintaining a balance of <strong>warm and cool tones</strong>, <strong>hard and soft edges</strong>, and <strong>light and dark values</strong>. By building a strong foundation with careful lay-ins, thoughtful layering, and attention to detail, the final rendering achieves a realistic and dynamic look.</p>
