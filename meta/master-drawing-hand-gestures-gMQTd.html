<p>In this lesson, you'll learn how to capture the gesture of the hand by focusing on the big laying of parts to organize what the hand is doing before developing its render.</p>

<h2>Hands as Communicative Tools</h2>

<p>Your hands aren't independent things that live outside and apart from your body, they are <strong>punctuators</strong>. Hands support your body language, and amplify your message. When used independently or disconnected from the body, they can seem bizarre and awkward.</p>

<h3>The Impact of Hand Gestures in Communication</h3>

<p>Consider the humorous scenario where someone doesn't know what to do with their hands during a speech. Their hands inappropriately raise in a way that's disconnected from their speech, making the situation feel awkward or amusing. We expect hands to support body language, and when they don't, it stands out.</p>

<p>The elevation of hands above the chest can feel alarming and unnatural. Studies suggest that hands can increase the effectiveness of a message by about <strong>60%</strong>. Politicians, for example, are scrutinized for their hand gestures because these movements are crafted to enhance their communication.</p>

<h3>Examples from Politicians</h3>

<ul>

<li><strong>John Kasich</strong> was criticized for his aggressive and unnatural chopping gestures that didn't match the cadence of his message.</li>

<li><strong>Barack Obama</strong> often spoke with his palms facing in towards the center of his body, starting gestures from the outside and concluding them inside, suggesting a bringing together.</li>

<li><strong>Donald Trump</strong> used sharp, outward gestures like pointing and chopping, creating different shapes and qualities in his communication.</li>

<li><strong>John F. Kennedy</strong> often gestured with his palm out and thumb on top, offering a softer shape compared to pointing.</li>

</ul>

<p>These examples show how hand gestures can convey different qualities, from openness to aggression, and how they support the speaker's message.</p>

<h2>Hands in Art and Storytelling</h2>

<p>In drawing, hands can communicate qualities about a character's personality or story. The appearance and gestures of hands can signify aspects like nervousness (chewed nails) or age (ragged hands).</p>

<h3>Importance of Hand Gestures in Character Design</h3>

<p>When designing characters, think about how their hand gestures and shapes support their body type and personality.</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Gaston</strong> from Disney's <em>Beauty and the Beast</em> has heavy, weighted hands that match his brutish upper body. His aggressive pointing gestures amplify his arrogant character.</li>

<li><strong>Merlin</strong>, on the other hand, has squarer, more stable hand shapes. His steepling gesture (hands together in a triangular shape) conveys wisdom, matching his wise character.</li>

</ul>

<p>By connecting hand gestures with body types and personalities, you enhance the storytelling in your art.</p>

<h2>Understanding Hand Structure for Drawing</h2>

<p>To capture the gesture of the hand, start by simplifying it into three main parts:</p>

<ol>

<li><strong>Forearm</strong></li>

<li><strong>Palm</strong></li>

<li><strong>Fingers</strong></li>

</ol>

<h3>Basic Proportions and Shapes</h3>

<ul>

<li><strong>Palm Length</strong>: From the wrist to the fingertip, the end of the palm is about <strong>halfway</strong>.</li>

<li><strong>Finger Arcs</strong>: The fingers decrease in length from the middle finger outward, following an <strong>arc or wave pattern</strong>.</li>

<li><strong>Middle Finger</strong>: It's the longest finger and serves as the peak in the arcs formed by the knuckles.</li>

<li><strong>Fingers Gesture Inward</strong>: All fingers have a slight angle <strong>towards the middle finger</strong>.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Using Gestural Lines</h3>

<p>Use <strong>C-curves</strong> and <strong>S-curves</strong> to capture the fluidity of the hand. Start with broad lines to establish the overall flow and then refine the shapes.</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Forearm to Palm</strong>: Begin with an S-curve for the outside of the forearm flowing into the hand.</li>

<li><strong>Palm Shape</strong>: Think of the palm as a <strong>box of playing cards</strong>, a simple geometric shape to frame the fingers.</li>

</ul>

<h3>The Thumb as a Door Wedge</h3>

<p>The thumb can be thought of as a <strong>door wedge</strong> attached to the side of the palm. This helps in visualizing its unique position and movement.</p>

<h3>Asymmetry in Fingers and Hands</h3>

<ul>

<li><strong>Bone and Padding</strong>: Each finger has <strong>bone on top</strong> (sharper) and <strong>padding on the bottom</strong> (softer).</li>

<li><strong>Asymmetrical Design</strong>: The fingers are asymmetrical in texture and rhythm, adding to the organic feel of the hand.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Drawing Techniques for Hands</h2>

<h3>Breaking Down the Hand into Simple Shapes</h3>

<p>Start by creating a basic <strong>envelope</strong> to capture the overall shape of the hand. This helps in organizing the parts without getting caught up in details.</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Forearm Width</strong>: Track down into the middle fingers, establishing the width.</li>

<li><strong>Finger Proportions</strong>: Each finger segment gets shorter by about a <strong>third</strong>, from proximal to middle to distal.</li>

<li><strong>Perspective Awareness</strong>: Be mindful of perspective, especially in foreshortened views.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Organizing Fingers and Proportions</h3>

<ul>

<li><strong>Middle Finger as Reference</strong>: Use the middle finger as a peak to establish arcs at every knuckle.</li>

<li><strong>Grouping Fingers</strong>: Sometimes, group fingers together to simplify complex poses.</li>

<li><strong>Negative Spaces</strong>: Pay attention to the negative spaces between fingers to enhance the hand's expressiveness.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Emphasizing the Middle Finger as the Peak</h3>

<ul>

<li><strong>Arcs and Waves</strong>: The knuckles and fingertips form arcs with the middle finger at the highest point.</li>

<li><strong>Finger Direction</strong>: Fingers subtly angle towards the middle finger, creating harmony in the hand's gesture.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Tips for Capturing Hand Gestures</h3>

<ul>

<li><strong>Start with Major Shapes</strong>: Focus on forearm, palm, and fingers before adding details.</li>

<li><strong>Maintain Fluidity</strong>: Keep the gestures smooth using C-curves and S-curves.</li>

<li><strong>Use Wrapping Lines</strong>: Introduce wrapping lines to suggest form and perspective.</li>

<li><strong>Capture the Essence</strong>: Aim to convey what the hand is doing and its expression, rather than getting lost in details.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Gesture Drawing Examples</h2>

<p>When practicing, work through several hand poses, applying the techniques above.</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Foreshortened Hands</strong>: Focus on the overall flow and use overlapping shapes to convey depth.</li>

<li><strong>Pointing Gestures</strong>: Emphasize the direction and extension of fingers, which can convey confrontation or directness.</li>

<li><strong>Grouped Fingers</strong>: Simplify complex finger arrangements by treating them as grouped shapes or hooks.</li>

</ul>

<p>Remember, the goal is to understand the hand's behavior and what it communicates. Don't get overwhelmed by the complexity, start simple and build upon the basic shapes.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p>Capturing the gesture of the hand is about understanding both its physical structure and its expressive capabilities. By focusing on the big laying of parts and using gestural lines, you can effectively convey the hand's movement and emotion in your drawings. Practice simplifying the hand into basic shapes, pay attention to proportions, and consider how hand gestures support the overall storytelling in your art.</p>
