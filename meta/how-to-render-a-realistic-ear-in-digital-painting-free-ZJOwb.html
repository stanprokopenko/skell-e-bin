<h2>What's in Premium?</h2>

<p>In this premium lesson, you'll learn to paint a full color rendering of an ear, step by step. We start with a <strong>color wash</strong> using <strong>cadmium red-orange</strong> to set a warm base. You'll create a <strong>rough gesture drawing</strong>, using specific shapes like the <strong>hook shape</strong> for the <strong>helix</strong> and <strong>antihelix</strong>, and organize your work with layers.</p>

<p>You'll learn how to <strong>block in flat local colors</strong> for the skin, hair, and earrings, and how to <strong>separate lights and darks</strong> to define shadow shapes. The lesson covers adding <strong>midtones and highlights</strong>, refining edges with blending techniques, and incorporating <strong>subsurface scattering</strong> to mimic light under the skin. We'll guide you through adding <strong>dark accents and highlights</strong> to enhance depth, and applying <strong>final touches</strong> to bring your painting together. Additionally, we'll revisit <strong>ear anatomy</strong> to reinforce your understanding of each part you're rendering.</p>
