<p>Have you ever wondered how to make someone look old in your drawings? Instead of relying solely on wrinkles, you can convey age by focusing on the underlying structure of the face. Here are some tips to help you depict age more effectively.</p>

<h2>Understand the Skull and Fat</h2>

<p>The key difference between youthful and aged faces lies in the visibility of the skull and the distribution of fat. In younger faces, <strong>more fat</strong> covers the skull, resulting in <strong>softer surfaces</strong> and less defined bone structures. In older faces, <strong>less fat</strong> reveals more of the <strong>hard surfaces</strong> of the skull, making features like cheekbones and eye sockets more pronounced.</p>

<h2>Emphasize Cheekbones and Facial Planes</h2>

<p>Start by constructing the basic head, marking the eye sockets, nose, mouth, and especially the cheekbones. Highlight the <strong>cheekbones</strong> where the <strong>fat has decreased</strong>, revealing the bone beneath. This creates sharper planes and angles, contributing to an aged appearance.</p>

<p>Avoid overusing wrinkles, instead, focus on how the <strong>planes of the face</strong> change with age. Show the contrasts between bone, muscle, and diminishing fat layers.</p>

<h2>Observe the Malar Fat Pad</h2>

<p>With age, the <strong>malar fat pad</strong> moves downward due to gravity. In youthful faces, it sits higher, smoothing the transition between the cheekbone and nose. In older faces, it slides down and gathers at the side of the nose, creating pronounced shapes and shadows. Depicting this shift emphasizes sagging associated with aging.</p>

<h2>Depict Sagging Around the Eyes</h2>

<p>The <strong>fat around the eyes</strong> sags with age, forming bags under the eyes and causing the skin to pinch or hang. This emphasizes the eye socket and makes the brow and forehead appear more prominent. Show how the upper eyelid droops and how shadows form where the skin sags.</p>

<h2>Show Changes in the Jawline</h2>

<p>As people age, the <strong>buccal fat</strong> (near the mouth) and <strong>jowl fat</strong> sag, disrupting the firm <strong>jawline</strong>. Including slight dips or bulges below the mandible line suggests an older age. Breaking up the straight jawline with these changes adds realism to aged portraits.</p>

<h2>Use Lighting to Enhance Age Features</h2>

<p>Consider how lighting affects the face. Strong lighting accentuates the <strong>planes</strong> and <strong>forms</strong>, making bone structures more prominent. Use <strong>hard edges</strong> to indicate sharp transitions in bone areas and <strong>soft edges</strong> for softer, sagging areas. Shadows emphasize the depth of eye sockets, prominence of cheekbones, and sagging features.</p>

<h2>Think About Edge Quality</h2>

<p>When shading, use <strong>edges</strong> to convey surface turns:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Soft edges</strong> indicate gradual changes, like the rounded forehead or sagging cheeks.</li>

<li><strong>Hard edges</strong> show abrupt changes, like the brow or cheekbones.</li>

</ul>

<p>Use edges thoughtfully to emphasize aged features. Remember that edges follow the form and help describe the three-dimensional structure.</p>

<h2>Incorporate Gravity's Effects</h2>

<p>Gravity affects how facial tissues move over time. Indicate the downward pull on facial fat and skin by showing how features like the cheeks, eyelids, and mouth corners shift or sag. This suggests aging without making the face look like it's melting.</p>

<h2>Combine Structure with Expression</h2>

<p>By understanding the underlying <strong>anatomy</strong> and how aging affects it, you can create more realistic and expressive portraits of older individuals. Focus on the <strong>interaction between the skull and overlying tissues</strong>, and how light and shadow play on these forms to tell a story with your drawing.</p>
