<h2>What's in Premium?</h2>

<p>Join me, Eric Gist (EMGIST), as I share my journey to becoming a comic cover artist. I'll discuss how I started in comics, my work on titles like <strong>Fantastic Four</strong>, <strong>Iron Fist</strong>, <strong>Wolverine</strong>, and <strong>Hulk</strong>, and how I developed my signature style with <strong>deep shadows</strong> and a <strong>moody atmosphere</strong>.</p>

<p>We'll explore why specializing early in your career can help you stand out. I'll offer advice on improving your cover art by studying master artists and focusing on fundamentals like figure drawing, anatomy, and composition. We'll also talk about embracing limitations to boost creativity and what I wish I knew when I started.</p>
