<p>In our second review of assignments for the perspective course, we've received over 250 submissions! While we can't get to all of them, your enthusiasm is making this journey exciting. Today, we'll dive into some of your works, provide feedback, and share insights to help you progress.</p>

<h2>Copying and Personalization</h2>

<h3>The Value of Copying</h3>

<p>Copying is good. When you copy isometric illusions found online, you're learning techniques, much like actors who imitate others to hone their craft. This practice helps you get better at using your <strong>straightedge</strong> and <strong>triangular rulers</strong>.</p>

<h3>Moving Beyond Copying</h3>

<p>However, it's important not to stop there. Just as actors personalize their performances by imitating family and friends, you should start experimenting with your own illusions. This personal exploration lets you internalize techniques and develop your unique style.</p>

<h2>Mastering the Instruments</h2>

<p>The first lesson is about the instruments. Many of you pointed out that the tools can feel clunky. That's normal. Using <strong>straightedges</strong>, <strong>triangles</strong>, and drafting tools takes practice. They may feel awkward if you haven't used them before. Spending time to become familiar with them can't do you any harm, you might even find that you like them!</p>

<h2>Exploring Optical Illusions</h2>

<h3>Mikdad's Progress</h3>

<p>Mikdad has been copying isometric illusions and feels much better at using the rulers. This is great for building control. Now, it's time to start experimenting with your own illusions and submit them. You're learning technique, much like an actor learns technique, and you're doing a good job getting used to the instruments.</p>

<h3>Stepka's Star Illusion</h3>

<p>Stepka created an impressive illusion by changing a frame into a star, <strong>possible, impossible, possible, impossible</strong>. The organized process and exploration of reversing spatial relationships, like turning an exterior corner into an interior one, make this piece intriguing. Even if the silhouette is similar to others, the way you manipulate lines and spaces creates fascinating contradictions.</p>

<h4>The Impossible Staircase</h4>

<p>Stepka also figured out the <strong>impossible staircase</strong> from Escher. This illusion plays with isometric perspective and involves some "cheating." It's not easily achievable with vanishing points, but in isometric perspective, you can experiment with such concepts. We'll get to more on "cheating" later.</p>

<h3>Li Ming Lin's Optical Illusions</h3>

<p>Li Ming Lin started with a cube to get used to the tools before moving on to optical illusions. <strong>Roughing it out first</strong> helped overcome challenges, like the bottom optical illusion that only looks correct at a certain angle. This is similar to sidewalk illusions that rely on perspective to create depth when viewed from a specific angle.</p>

<h4>The Impossible Chessboard</h4>

<p>While working on Sandro Del Prete's impossible chessboard, Li Ming noticed that the placement of chess pieces is important. For example, the rook on the right covers part of the chessboard as it approaches a twist, enhancing the illusion. When composing your own illusions, consider how strategic placement can strengthen the effect.</p>

<h3>Michael Giff's Experience</h3>

<p>Michael found that without roughing it out first, he spent too much time measuring and trying to create something "cool." By starting with rough sketches, you can work through problems before committing to precise lines. This approach spares you the frustration of having to redo work due to inaccuracies.</p>

<h3>ESPY's Practice</h3>

<p>ESPY tried to fit all illusions on one page and made notes about issues with <strong>consistency in line angles and proportions</strong>. Even with measuring, keeping lines parallel in isometric perspective can be challenging. Using triangles and locking down your tools can help maintain accuracy. Precision is key when moving from rough sketches to final drawings.</p>

<h2>The Importance of Process</h2>

<h3>Roughing It Out</h3>

<p>Starting with a rough sketch allows you to conceptualize before focusing on precision. It's okay if the rough is messy, as long as you understand it. You can clean it up later using your tools.</p>

<h3>Precision with Tools</h3>

<p>When using straightedges and triangles, every line and point must be exact. Small inaccuracies can throw off the entire illusion. Practice controlling your lines and pressing down appropriately to prevent shifting. Over time, these tools will feel like extensions of your hand.</p>

<h2>Cheating and Optical Illusions</h2>

<p>Optical illusions often involve a level of "cheating," intentionally manipulating perspectives to achieve impossible scenarios. For example, TVH struggled with creating gaps inside walls without "cheating," or changing the view. By adjusting lines and "fattening" certain areas, you can create the desired effect. This is a perfectly legitimate approach in crafting illusions.</p>

<h2>Motivation and Application</h2>

<h3>Overcoming Challenges</h3>

<p>Creating complex optical illusions isn't easy. It requires planning, thinking, experimenting, and iterating. If you find it challenging or feel unmotivated, remember that these exercises sharpen your ability to perceive and manipulate space.</p>

<h3>Beyond Parlor Tricks</h3>

<p>Some might see optical illusions as mere novelty parlor tricks, but they offer valuable insights into perception and design. They can be used cleverly in storytelling, graphic novels, and illustrations to convey deeper meanings or create engaging narratives.</p>

<h3>Finding Inspiration</h3>

<p>If you're seeking inspiration, look for examples where optical illusions are integrated into stories or artwork. Sharing and discussing with peers can also spark new ideas and approaches.</p>

<h2>Embracing the Process</h2>

<h3>Finding Joy in the Work</h3>

<p>Brandon shared a great attitude: "I feel like the canvas is my playground in this project." Approaching these exercises with a sense of playfulness can make the work enjoyable and rewarding.</p>

<h3>Meditative Practice</h3>

<p>Mariah mentioned finding the exercises meditative after a while. Engaging deeply with these projects can alter your state of consciousness, leading to a satisfying sense of achievement.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p>Thank you for your dedication and creativity. Working on optical illusions strengthens your ability to handle the tension between <strong>shapes</strong> (flat) and <strong>forms</strong> (three-dimensional). Even if you didn't post your work, take time to look at what your peers are doing, some pieces are very impressive and worth studying.</p>

<p>This exercise gets you thinking about flat and 3D spaces, preparing you for more advanced topics like <strong>orthographics</strong>, <strong>eyeballing orthos into oblique drawings</strong>, and <strong>plan projections</strong>. These challenges lie ahead, and your efforts now are laying a strong foundation.</p>

<p>Remember, we're all part of a community stretching our brains together. Keep experimenting, embrace the challenges, and enjoy the process. See you in the next project!</p>
