<h2>Why Gradations Matter</h2>

<p>Gradations build your <strong>pressure control</strong>, <strong>stroke consistency</strong>, <strong>clean edges</strong>, and <strong>patience</strong>. They help you create smooth transitions in your shading. The same habits from line quality apply here: keep a relaxed grip, don’t squeeze the pencil, and use your shoulder and elbow for longer strokes. Use your wrist for shorter ones. Keep movements smooth, not choppy. No scribbling.</p>

<p>Make sure to sharpen your pencil before you begin. If you need a refresher, refer back to the pencil sharpening lesson from earlier in the course.</p>

<h2>Gradations Using the Tip</h2>

<h3>Short Gradations</h3>

<p>Try three pencil tip lengths: <strong>short</strong> (about ¼ inch), <strong>medium</strong> (about 1 inch), and <strong>long</strong> (about 2–4 inches). Fill a page with bars that go from dark to light, then reverse it from light to dark. Compress a smooth transition into a small space. This helps you capture firm core shadows on forms like cheekbones or nose balls.</p>

<h3>Medium and Long Gradations</h3>

<p>Use the entire length of your tip to practice slow, consistent value transitions. Aim for a smooth shift from one side of the bar to the other without visible steps or scratchy texture. If the paper’s texture fights you, try a smoother paper. Slightly overlap each stroke like shingles on a roof and gradually adjust your pressure.</p>

<h2>Gradations Using the Side</h2>

<p>Lay your pencil on its side. You can use graphite or charcoal. The broad plane of the lead covers more area and blends your tones smoothly. This is great for soft edges on a larger scale. Fill a page with curved planes or long, medium, and short bars to practice fading from light to dark.</p>

<h2>Individual Strokes</h2>

<p>If you have a charcoal pencil sharpened well, practice creating shapes with just one to three strokes. Use the tip for a sharp edge or the side for a soft edge. If one stroke isn’t enough, add only a few more. You can even try a single stroke that’s sharp on one side and soft on the other. This is tricky and requires a very sharp pencil.</p>

<p>Practice these warmups often before your main drawing session. They build a core shading skill that improves the look and feeling of all your drawings.</p>
