<h2>My Sketchbook Journey</h2>

<p>From age 40 to 45, I filled sketchbook pages with hundreds of drawings. I became a bit of a social misfit, often bowing out of conversations to immerse myself in these little arenas. But <strong>the reward</strong> was the ability to <strong>draw as exploration without planning</strong>. I became comfortable drawing without knowing what would happen, focusing on <strong>process over perfection</strong>.</p>

<h2>Drawing Without Planning</h2>

<p>In my sketchbooks, I started lightly and loosely. As the image <strong>crisped in my imagination</strong>, I'd gradually <strong>bear down</strong>. These drawings had stages, but they were <strong>spontaneous</strong>. Often, I'd get an idea or see something inspiring and want to get it down while it was fresh in my mind. About half were from imagination, and the other half were responses to things like the Thunder Beast at the Natural History Museum.</p>

<h2>Working in Stages</h2>

<p>Some of my sketches, like those involving radial symmetry, took an hour or more. I'd include shading, but only after truly understanding the forms. <strong>You earn the right to shade</strong> when you know the structure. I used graphite pencils and mechanical pencils, nothing special about the medium.</p>

<h2>Embracing New Mediums</h2>

<p>After thousands of hours with pencils, I grew tired of their ability to gradate. I became excited about using steel pens with walnut ink, <strong>digging into the paper without knowing how the form would come out</strong>. While pencils allow for gradation and erasing, starting with ink can make a piece <strong>come alive</strong>. For every one that works, there are many that don't, but I love the <strong>wildness and risk</strong>.</p>

<h2>Learning to Draw First</h2>

<p>Throwing down ink lines and hoping for something good requires one secret: <strong>learn to draw first</strong>. One of my first spontaneous drawings was of two apes at the LA Zoo. Emotion drove the process, not conscious thinking. Only later did I realize I was subconsciously aware of the forms and lines.</p>

<h2>Different Approaches</h2>

<h3>Simon Guinard's Thoughtful Lines</h3>

<p>Simon Guinard says, "<strong>Produce with your mind. Always have an idea in place. Think your lines before you touch the paper</strong>." He emphasizes planning every line.</p>

<h3>Justin Sweet's Gut-Driven Painting</h3>

<p>Contrastingly, Justin Sweet paints quickly, "<strong>right from the gut. No thinking</strong>." He lets the image stay in his imagination, allowing spontaneity to guide him.</p>

<h2>Two Ways of Working</h2>

<p>There are <strong>two ways of working</strong>:</p>

<ol>

<li>

<p><strong>Careful Stages</strong>: Planning, solving one thing at a time, thinking through each step. At least one stage should be about brainstorming and playing with variations.</p>

</li>

<li>

<p><strong>Improv</strong>: Taking risks and being willing to make mistakes. As Ralph Steadman said, "<strong>There are no mistakes, only opportunities to do something new</strong>."</p>

</li>

</ol>

<p>In this course, we'll lean towards working in stages because it's sensible, especially when collaborating with others. However, your greatest work may happen through improvisation, and all of this aims to give you the skills to do that.</p>

<h2>Starting with Fundamentals</h2>

<p>Let's begin with the simplest drawing skill an artist can develop: <strong>the ability to draw a straight line</strong>.</p>
