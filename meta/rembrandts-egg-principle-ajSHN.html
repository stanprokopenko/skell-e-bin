<p>Let's take a moment away from painting to discuss the <strong>egg principle</strong>. This is a technique my teacher taught me, and it's something I always think about when painting. Rembrandt is a prime example of an artist who mastered this principle. His portraits have a glow that draws you in, and it's all thanks to the egg principle.</p>

<h2>Explanation of the Egg Principle</h2>

<p>The <strong>egg principle</strong> is simple. Imagine an egg with a light source above it. The top of the egg, closest to the light, is the <strong>brightest point</strong>. As the light cascades down the egg, it gradually transitions from light to shadow. This is similar to how light behaves on a sphere.</p>

<h2>Application of the Egg Principle in Painting</h2>

<p>When painting a head, apply the egg principle by maintaining the <strong>lightest light</strong> at the top and allowing it to gradually darken as it moves down. This is akin to rendering a ball, focusing on the simplicity of the form. The human head is essentially an egg with features like the nose and lips added on.</p>

<h2>Importance of Restraint in Highlight Application</h2>

<p>It's crucial to <strong>restrain</strong> yourself from applying equal highlights across the head. The highlights should be consistent with the direction of the light source. This means the brightest highlights are at the top, and as you move down, the tones should get darker. This maintains a clear separation between light and shadow.</p>

<h2>Rembrandt's Use of the Egg Principle</h2>

<p>Rembrandt was meticulous in applying the egg principle. He ensured that nothing was as light as the highlight area, creating subtle transitions that gave his paintings a glowing effect. He used both above and side lighting to demonstrate this principle, making his work appear almost magical.</p>

<p>I encourage you to apply the egg principle in your painting. It helps create a three-dimensional glow that makes your work stand out. Remember this principle as you continue painting, and you'll notice the difference it makes in achieving a realistic portrayal of light and shadow. Let's get back to painting, keeping the egg principle in mind for our next masterpiece.</p>
