<h2>What's in Premium?</h2>

<p>In this lesson, you'll learn two approaches to mastering form and proportions: the <strong>blob approach</strong> and the use of <strong>grids</strong>. The blob approach helps you capture forms quickly by focusing on line angles without worrying about proportions. Grids assist you in starting with accurate lines and comparing orthographic views (<strong>orthos</strong>) to foreshortened views, helping you guess proportions. You'll explore the benefits and challenges of using grids and learn from the techniques of artist <strong>Kim Jung Gi</strong>. The lesson includes a project where you'll redraw your form studies, practice foreshortening, and apply practical tips to improve your drawing skills.</p>
