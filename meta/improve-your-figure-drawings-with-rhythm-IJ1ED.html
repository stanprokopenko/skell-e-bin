<p>Congratulations on finishing the first assignment! You all did some fantastic submissions. In this critique, we'll focus on <strong>standing poses</strong>. Many of you had good questions about foreshortening, extreme angles, twisting, and space. Those topics will come in later lessons. </p>

<p>For now, let's concentrate on:</p>

<ul>

<li>Understanding the <strong>separation of contour from rhythm and abstraction</strong>.</li>

<li>Setting up a <strong>blueprint</strong> that can be developed in terms of gesture and figure.</li>

<li>Examining how the <strong>rhythm</strong> looks and if we're getting <strong>symmetrical</strong>.</li>

<li><strong>Explaining differences in weight</strong>.</li>

</ul>

<p>These small pieces are essential. If you have issues with these problems, this is a good review to come back to.</p>

<h2>Using Examples to Improve Your Drawings</h2>

<p>I'll share examples so you can see side-by-side comparisons. In some cases, I'll show what I might do differently. But that doesn't mean you have to mimic exactly what I'm doing.</p>

<h3>Example: Hermes Running</h3>

<p>Here's a cool one of Hermes running. There's a lot of drama and movement in it.</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Observation</strong>: The pose feels a bit static.</li>

<li><strong>Goal</strong>: Make it feel like there's more movement or drama in the way he's running.</li>

</ul>

<h4>Steps to Enhance Movement</h4>

<ol>

<li><strong>Initiate Rhythm on a Diagonal</strong>: When making gesture lines, place them dramatically on a diagonal to force a back and forth.<ul>

<li>This over-exaggeration anticipates the stiffening that happens when forms are added later.</li>

</ul>

</li>

<li><strong>Emphasize the Thrust</strong>: Look for two diagonals, the thrust of the ribcage forward and the pull of the pelvis back.<ul>

<li>Keep it loose and avoid getting too contoured, which can take away rhythm.</li>

</ul>

</li>

<li><strong>Use Wrapping Lines</strong>: For foreshortening or indicating cylinders going back in space, use wrapping lines as shorthand.<ul>

<li>Think of angling a cylinder (like a toilet paper roll) relative to a limb to match its direction.</li>

</ul>

</li>

</ol>

<h4>Adjusting the Limbs</h4>

<ul>

<li><strong>Shorten Lines for Foreshortening</strong>: Make lines shorter and push the degree of wrapping to create a sense of depth.</li>

<li><strong>Chain Rhythms</strong>: Use curves to connect one part of the body to another, like bumping into the lower leg and back into the foot.</li>

<li><strong>Match Angles for Unity</strong>: Tweak limbs to match the direction of others to build a sense of unity and movement.<ul>

<li>Avoid horizontal lines that can make the pose feel stiff.</li>

</ul>

</li>

</ul>

<h2>Connecting Limbs and Creating Flow</h2>

<p>A common issue is how to connect limbs into the starting pathways of rhythms from the torso.</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Strategize Connections</strong>: Decide which lines you'll use to help draw the eye out or make limbs feel integrated.</li>

<li><strong>Avoid Contour Dependency</strong>: Don't rely solely on contours, think of abstract diagrams and relationships between body parts.</li>

<li><strong>Emphasize Rhythmic Bridges</strong>: Ensure there's a flow from one area to the next without abrupt breaks.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Using Long Lines for Passive Limbs</h3>

<ul>

<li><strong>Passive vs. Active Sides</strong>: Differentiate them by creating longer flows for passive limbs.</li>

<li><strong>Show More with Less</strong>: Use economy in your lines to convey movement efficiently.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Handling Back Views and Symmetry</h2>

<h3>Back Views</h3>

<ul>

<li><strong>Opposite Wrapping Lines</strong>: For back views, the wrapping lines are opposite to front views.<ul>

<li>The pelvis comes back at us, so wrapping lines go accordingly.</li>

</ul>

</li>

<li><strong>Integrate Limbs</strong>: Use asymmetries in the limbs once you get into them.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Symmetrical Poses</h3>

<ul>

<li><strong>Challenging Symmetry</strong>: Symmetrical poses can feel static.</li>

<li><strong>Use Shape if Necessary</strong>: Sometimes, you may need to use shape to convey the figure when rhythm isn't enough.</li>

<li><strong>Introduce Diagonals</strong>: Even in symmetrical poses, add diagonals with arms or legs to bring interest.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Emphasizing Story and Design</h2>

<p>When drawing, think beyond just capturing the twist or foreshortening.</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Focus on the Story</strong>: What's the big idea of the pose? What's compelling about it?</li>

<li><strong>Use Rhythm to Convey Emotion</strong>: The movement and positioning can tell a story.</li>

<li><strong>Design for Unity</strong>: Match limbs' angles, create parallels, and think about the overall composition.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Example: Adam and Eve</h3>

<ul>

<li><strong>Observation</strong>: Adam's pose shows hesitation before taking the apple.</li>

<li><strong>Design Choices</strong>:<ul>

<li>Use diagonals to show movement.</li>

<li>Observe how limbs break symmetry to draw focus.</li>

<li>Simplify to capture the big story moments.</li>

</ul>

</li>

</ul>

<h2>Tips for Practicing Gesture Drawing</h2>

<ul>

<li><strong>Avoid Adjusting for Body Type Early On</strong>: Treat every body the same in gesture stages.<ul>

<li>Customize body types with shape later.</li>

</ul>

</li>

<li><strong>Focus on Posing and Position</strong>: Leave details like muscle shapes and proportions for later stages.</li>

<li><strong>Stay in the Flow</strong>: Your attention should constantly redirect from one area to the next without interruption.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Common Issues to Avoid</h2>

<ul>

<li><strong>Symmetry in Limbs</strong>: Beware of making limbs too symmetrical, which can stiffen the pose.</li>

<li><strong>Isolated Lines</strong>: Don't let lines exist too far from one another, move them up to create rhythm.</li>

<li><strong>Attachment Points</strong>: Avoid sticking limbs on as shapes, integrate them into the figure's flow.</li>

<li><strong>Overemphasis on Contour</strong>: Refrain from focusing too much on outer shapes at this stage.</li>

</ul>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p>Great job on your submissions! The main areas to focus on moving forward are:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Enhancing Connections</strong>: Work on how you connect all parts of the figure.</li>

<li><strong>Maintaining Rhythm</strong>: Use the asymmetrical breakdown to interpret the body through rhythm.</li>

<li><strong>Creating Unified Figures</strong>: Ensure there's a rhythmic interchange throughout the figure.</li>

<li><strong>Challenging Contour Dependency</strong>: Move away from contour and embrace the abstract diagram of rhythm.</li>

</ul>

<p>Remember, these adjustments are challenging but essential for improving your gesture drawings. Keep experimenting with these techniques, and you'll see significant progress in capturing dynamic poses.</p>
