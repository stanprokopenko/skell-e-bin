<h2>Project Overview</h2>

<p>I work from the same photo you have so we can stay on the exact image. I’m using graphite for the whole drawing, then a little charcoal powder for the background. Graphite slows the demo down, but it lets me show every stage clearly.  </p>

<p>We’re at the point in the course where <strong>all earlier concepts overlap</strong>:<br />

<em> proportions<br />

</em> gesture / rhythms<br />

<em> shape design<br />

</em> form &amp; structure (the head as a box)<br />

<em> perspective<br />

</em> composition<br />

* values  </p>

<p>Until your “muscles” can juggle everything at once, move in <strong>clear stages</strong>. I demo the stages one at a time so you can see the thought process.  </p>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<h2>Laying-In the Big Proportions</h2>

<h3>1. Find a Ground-Truth Measurement</h3>

<p>I took the <strong>width of the beard</strong> (right under the nose). That width fits<br />

• once from the top of the head to the bottom of the nose<br />

• once more from the bottom of the nose to the beard’s core shadow<br />

• plus a sliver for the little hook at the very bottom.  </p>

<p>Everything else has to fit inside that measurement.</p>

<h3>2. Light Construction</h3>

<p>• Center-line has a slight tilt.<br />

• Cheekbone rhythm separates front plane from side plane, exactly like the box-of-the-head project.

• I keep angles <strong>simple polygons</strong> so they’re easy to shift if something feels off.  </p>

<p>I drew multiple light lines so the camera can see them, you don’t have to.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<h2>Designing Rhythms &amp; Shapes</h2>

<p>I design hair, beard and cheek with <strong>connected rhythms</strong> so the eye can flow:  </p>

<ul>

<li>The hair swoops down into the bridge of the nose.  </li>

<li>A triangle shadow under the nose points into the cheekbone.  </li>

<li>Negative shapes on left and right beard <strong>aren’t equal</strong>, one is heavier so the design feels balanced, not mirrored.</li>

</ul>

<p>Accuracy matters, but a <strong>good-looking, believable shape beats perfect tracing</strong> every time.  </p>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<h2>Shadow Mapping (Notan Stage)</h2>

<ol>

<li>**Squint hard. ** Large masses merge, ignore tiny changes.</li>

<li>Outline every shadow edge with an H pencil.  </li>

<li>Fill the entire shadow family with one flat value (4B).  </li>

<li>Blow through small “light lakes” inside the shadow, I’ll pick them out later with an eraser.</li>

</ol>

<p>No outlines where light meets light (bridge of the nose, forehead). Those edges will melt together.  </p>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<h2>Two Values Inside the Shadow</h2>

<p>Switch to a 6B and add the <strong>darkest accents</strong>:<br />

• mouth interior<br />

• nostrils<br />

• corners of the eyes<br />

• deepest hair pockets  </p>

<p>At this point I keep only <strong>two values in the shadow family</strong>: a lighter shadow mass and a darker accent. I resist the urge to model form yet.  </p>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<h2>Dropping in the Background with Charcoal Powder</h2>

<p>Materials I used<br />

<em> loose charcoal powder<br />

</em> cheap bristle brush (scrubber)<br />

<em> super-soft mop brush<br />

</em> kneaded &amp; pencil erasers  </p>

<p>Preparations<br />

1. Test temperature: my pan-pastel was warmer than the powder, so I ditched the pan-pastel.<br />

2. Decide where the background will be darker than the head to frame it.  </p>

<p>Application<br />

• Scrub the powder into the paper for a <strong>mid-tone shadow</strong> behind the cast.<br />

• Soft brush feathers the powder upward for a <strong>light half-tone</strong> on the cheek.<br />

• Always keep a scrap paper under your hand, charcoal lifts easily.

• Don’t spit, droplets glue powder and leave black freckles.</p>

<p>Important rule, **never mix charcoal accents with graphite accents. ** Graphite catches glare, charcoal doesn’t. Mixing both in your darkest darks creates ugly, spotty reflections.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<h2>Establishing the Five-Value Structure</h2>

<p>Value 1 – black accents (6B graphite)<br />

Value 2 – main shadow mass (4B graphite)<br />

Value 3 – dark half-tone (charcoal powder scrubbed in)<br />

Value 4 – light half-tone (thin layer of powder or soft graphite)<br />

Value 5 – white of the paper (picked out with eraser)  </p>

<p>Key points<br />

• <strong>Bright whites live mostly on the top planes</strong>, I removed value 5 from the beard so it rolls downward.

• Large masses first, details later. The beard, lower lip and neck all sit in value 3–4 so the face dominates.  </p>

<p>I “draw with the eraser” to pull value 5 back out of the powder: crisp highlight on the lip, soft glints on brow ridge, broad planes on forehead.  </p>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<h2>Edges</h2>

<p>I start hinting at edges but still keep it simple:<br />

<em> hard edge: light cheek against dark background, bottom rim of beard sweep<br />

</em> soft edge: cheek as it rolls toward the mouth, upper brow fading into shadow<br />

* lost edge: top of head where light meets light  </p>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<h2>Framing the Focal Area</h2>

<p>A value-1 shape behind the ear and cheek pops the head forward.<br />

The beard’s tail gets a sharp dark accent, then fades with a soft brush so the <strong>gesture stays readable</strong> without stealing attention.  </p>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<h2>Level-1 Finish – Where You Stop</h2>

<p>At Level 1 you should have:<br />

• clear five-value design<br />

• simple masses, no fiddly rendering<br />

• limited soft edges (background, big core shadows)<br />

• strongest contrasts around the eyes / nose / brow  </p>

<p>Do NOT chase tiny textures in the beard or pores in the cheek yet. The drawing should already read from across the room.  </p>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<h2>Preview of Level 2</h2>

<p>Next I’ll:<br />

<em> allow many subtle steps </em><em>inside each of the five buckets</em><em> (no longer locked to only five)<br />

</em> refine edges plane-by-plane<br />

* sculpt form within the shadow mass without breaking the overall design  </p>

<p>But the underlying composition you see right now stays exactly the same.  </p>

<p>Take your Level-1 drawing to this clean, graphic stage first. Once it works in five values, moving on to Level 2 rendering is straightforward fun instead of a fight.</p>
