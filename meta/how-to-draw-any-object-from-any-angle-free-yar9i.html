<h2>What's in Premium?</h2>

<p>In this lesson, you'll learn to simplify complex objects into basic forms that you can draw accurately from any angle. By reducing objects to simple shapes like boxes, cylinders, and spheres, you'll develop the ability to draw from imagination rather than merely copying what you see.</p>

<p>You'll practice repositioning these simplified forms to understand their structure and master the line systems that determine perspective. The lesson introduces the <strong>Blob Approach</strong>, a method of starting with a shape and adding cross-contour lines to define it.</p>

<p>Your challenge will be to choose a subject, preferably boxy, and draw it in various positions without focusing on detailâ€”enhancing your skill in visualizing forms from different angles.</p>
