<h2>What's in Premium?</h2>

<p>In this premium lesson on figure drawing, we embrace the challenges of <strong>foreshortening</strong> and turn them into opportunities for expressive art. You'll learn how to use the <strong>mermaid's net</strong> (also known as the <strong>envelope</strong>) to map out complex poses and establish where limbs fit within your composition. We focus on drawing with <strong>rhythm</strong> and a deep understanding of <strong>anatomy</strong>, paying attention to muscles like the <strong>tensor fasciae latae</strong> and how gravity affects the body's form.</p>

<p>You'll discover how to adjust proportions in foreshortened views—like making the head larger or exaggerating hips and knees—to compensate for distortion and enhance your drawing. We encourage you to adopt the mantra <strong>"push it till it breaks,"</strong> exploring exaggeration and being fearless in your approach. By balancing technique with personal expression, you'll learn to make artistic choices that please you and add dynamism to your work.</p>
