<p>I'm excited to share the winners of our recent figure sculpture competition. Before diving into the results, I want to thank everyone who participated. It was fantastic to see almost 100 people from all over the world coming together to sculpt and improve their skills. Your dedication and enthusiasm made this competition a success.</p>

<h2>Competition Overview</h2>

<p>This competition was special because it brought together a diverse group of artists. One of the main things I considered while judging was whether I could envision the sculpture cast in bronze and displayed in a gallery. I looked for sculptures where the details, textures, and overall presentation worked cohesively.</p>

<p>I appreciate all the feedback I have received. Some of you mentioned preferring when we offer two poses, a male and a female, to provide more options. I'll keep that in mind for future competitions. If you have any other suggestions on how to make these competitions better, please let me know.</p>

<h2>Honorable Mentions</h2>

<p>While there were many amazing entries, I want to give honorable mentions to two artists whose work stood out.</p>

<h3>Carlos Jara</h3>

<p>Carlos, from Venezuela, created a sculpture with an interesting texture and thoughtful details, especially in the base and the hair. The piece felt well-conceived and executed. Great job, Carlos!</p>

<h3>Yongping Li</h3>

<p>Yongping's sculpture was cohesive and had a pleasing aesthetic. It felt complete and well done. Excellent work, Yongping!</p>

<h2>Third Place Winner: Gwendolyn Mallet</h2>

<p>Our third place prize of $100 goes to <strong>Gwendolyn Mallet</strong>. I was impressed by the attention to detail, particularly in the base. The figure had a consistent texture and felt complete. The pose, anatomy, and gesture all worked together harmoniously. Capturing a good likeness is challenging, but Gwendolyn did a fantastic job.</p>

<h2>Second Place Winner: Quentin McCann</h2>

<p>The second place prize of $150 is awarded to <strong>Quentin McCann</strong>. Quentin's sculpture stood out with its well-treated forms and anatomy. The balance and gesture were spot on, and the details in the hands and face were accurate and appealing. The presentation and lighting also enhanced the sculpture. Congratulations, Quentin!</p>

<p><em>Full disclosure: I know Quentin personally, having competed with him in person before. He's a talented sculptor and art teacher, and his professionalism shines through in his work.</em></p>

<h2>First Place Winner: Sladjana Buhač</h2>

<p>The first place prize of $500 goes to <strong>Sladjana Buhač</strong>. Sladjana's sculpture captivated me with its pleasant and attractive facial features, a difficult feat in sculpture. The face and hands are crucial elements, and Sladjana excelled in rendering them. Although some elements like the base were a bit sketchy, the focus on the figure was exceptional. The sculpture felt well-executed, and nothing appeared out of place. Outstanding work, Sladjana!</p>

<h2>Next Steps for Winners</h2>

<p>To the winners, I'll reach out to you directly to arrange the prize distribution. Please check your messages.</p>

<p>Thank you again to everyone who participated. It was inspiring to see so many artists committing to sculpting a figure and completing a sculpture in just a few weeks. I hope you all enjoyed the experience as much as I did.</p>

<p>I'm planning to host more competitions in the future, possibly in the spring and fall. Stay tuned for updates, and feel free to subscribe to stay informed.</p>
