<p>Welcome back, everyone. Today I'm going to demonstrate three visual memory drawing exercises for figure drawing. These exercises are designed to challenge and improve your ability to draw figures from memory, while also incorporating design and invention skills.</p>

<h2>Exercise 1: Look, Remember, Draw</h2>

<p>For this exercise, I'll analyze the pose, remember key details, and then draw from memory.</p>

<p><strong>Analyzing the Pose:</strong></p>

<ul>

<li>Observe the overall gesture and major rhythms</li>

<li>Note key proportions and alignments</li>

<li>Simplify to basic forms</li>

</ul>

<p>When analyzing, I focus on things like:</p>

<ul>

<li>The main gesture line from shoulder to foot</li>

<li>Position of the raised knee relative to the belly button</li>

<li>Alignment of the torso with the leg</li>

</ul>

<p>I also take quick mental measurements, like comparing the distance from head to glutes with the distance from glutes to foot.</p>

<p><strong>Drawing from Memory:</strong></p>

<ol>

<li>Start with light construction lines for proportions</li>

<li>Lay in the basic gesture and angles</li>

<li>Build up the mannequin forms:<ul>

<li>Use simple geometric shapes (boxes, cylinders)</li>

<li>Consider the 3D orientation of each form</li>

<li>Pay attention to foreshortening</li>

</ul>

</li>

</ol>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>

<ul>

<li>Keep lines light for easy adjustments</li>

<li>Focus on the overall pose and proportions, not details</li>

<li>Use simplified mannequin forms, not detailed anatomy</li>

</ul>

<p>After drawing, I compare to the reference. It's important to analyze what I remembered accurately and what I missed. This feedback helps improve future attempts.</p>

<h2>Exercise 2: Reference to New Angle</h2>

<p>For this exercise, I'll draw from the reference, then draw it again from memory at a new angle.</p>

<p><strong>Drawing from Reference:</strong></p>

<ul>

<li>Focus on understanding the 3D forms</li>

<li>Use cross-contours to clarify form relationships</li>

<li>Consider how forms connect and overlap</li>

</ul>

<p><strong>Drawing from New Angle:</strong></p>

<ol>

<li>Visualize how the forms would look from the new viewpoint</li>

<li>Start with major forms and gesture</li>

<li>Adjust and refine, considering perspective and foreshortening</li>

</ol>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>

<ul>

<li>Use "blobby" shapes before refining to blocks</li>

<li>Think about which planes are visible from the new angle</li>

<li>It's okay to invent or adjust parts you can't fully remember</li>

</ul>

<p>Remember, the goal isn't a perfect drawing, but to strengthen your understanding and memory of 3D forms.</p>

<h2>Exercise 3: Study and Redesign</h2>

<p>This exercise involves studying the reference briefly, then drawing from memory with new proportions and from a different angle.</p>

<p><strong>Studying the Reference:</strong></p>

<ul>

<li>Analyze the core pose and gesture</li>

<li>Note key relationships between body parts</li>

<li>Understand the overall balance and weight distribution</li>

</ul>

<p><strong>Drawing with New Design:</strong></p>

<ol>

<li>Choose a new viewing angle and proportions</li>

<li>Start with the core of the pose (often the torso)</li>

<li>Adjust limb positions to fit the new proportions</li>

<li>Consider how the new proportions affect the overall design</li>

</ol>

<p><strong>Key Points:</strong></p>

<ul>

<li>Changing proportions will affect the pose - adjust as needed</li>

<li>Focus on capturing the essence of the original pose</li>

<li>Use your design skills to make the new version appealing</li>

</ul>

<h2>Tips for Practicing Visual Memory Drawing</h2>

<ol>

<li>Start with simpler poses and gradually increase difficulty</li>

<li>Reduce study time as you improve to challenge yourself more</li>

<li>Focus on understanding the pose, not just memorizing lines</li>

<li>Incorporate these exercises into your regular practice routine</li>

<li>Don't get discouraged by imperfect results - it's all good practice</li>

</ol>

<p>Remember, the goal of these exercises is to improve your ability to draw from memory and imagination. They combine memory skills with design and invention, which are crucial for creating original figure drawings and character designs.</p>

<p>Keep practicing regularly, and you'll see improvement in your ability to visualize and draw figures from any angle. Good luck, and I'll see you in the next lesson where we'll be moving on to shading techniques.</p>
