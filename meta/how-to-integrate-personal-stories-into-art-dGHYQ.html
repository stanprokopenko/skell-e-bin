<p>Hi everyone! I'm Bryce Ko, a concept artist and illustrator. You might know me from <strong>"Sea of Stars,"</strong> where I did all the illustrations and character designs. In this article, I'll walk you through my <strong>process</strong> for creating two pieces: a personal illustration and a <strong>"Spirited Away"</strong> fan art.</p>

<h2>Personal Illustration: Cat Character</h2>

<h3>Research</h3>

<p>I began with <strong>research</strong>, focusing on drawing cats. My cousin once asked me to create a cat-themed illustration, but I realized I wasn't comfortable drawing cats. So, I searched for cat images and doodled interesting poses. I aimed to understand their <strong>geometry</strong> by breaking them down into shapes and even studied their <strong>skeletons</strong> to grasp their structure.</p>

<h3>Sketch and Line Art</h3>

<p>Feeling more confident, I moved on to the <strong>sketch</strong>. Sometimes I dive straight into ink, but for this piece, I roughed it out first. After finalizing the sketch, I worked on the <strong>line art</strong>, refining details and solidifying the composition.</p>

<h3>Flats and Final Piece</h3>

<p>Next came the <strong>flats</strong>, where I filled in the colors. I kept the palette <strong>simple</strong>, limiting the number of colors to make adjustments easier later on. This approach helps <strong>maintain cohesiveness</strong> and speeds up the process. Lastly, I added <strong>shadows and highlights</strong> to bring the illustration to life, using multiply layers for shading and adding light to define textures.</p>

<h2>Fan Art: Spirited Away</h2>

<h3>Research and Exploration</h3>

<p>For my <strong>"Spirited Away"</strong> fan art, I needed extensive research. I drew various characters to get familiar with <strong>Miyazaki's style</strong>, starting with rough sketches and gradually capturing the mood I wanted. This phase helped me decide which characters to include and how to evoke the feeling of the film.</p>

<h3>Thumbnails and Composition</h3>

<p>I created several <strong>thumbnails</strong> to plan the composition. Initially, I considered a horizontal orientation with Sen, but I wanted to include more characters. I settled on a scene with the main characters flying over a <strong>night market</strong>, inspired by my experience at the <strong>Raohe Night Market</strong> in Taiwan.</p>

<h3>Line Art and Flats</h3>

<p>With the composition set, I dove into the <strong>line art</strong>, incorporating various <strong>Ghibli characters</strong> as Easter eggs throughout the scene. For the <strong>flats</strong>, I kept the color palette cohesive, adjusting colors to fit within a unified scheme. By limiting the colors, I maintained harmony and made it easier to adjust later.</p>

<h3>Adding Shading and Light</h3>

<p>I added highlights and adjusted values to achieve the <strong>nighttime vibe</strong> of a bustling market. By <strong>crunching down the color palette</strong> and focusing on the main light source, I unified the piece and made the primary characters stand out. The final result captures the atmosphere I aimed for, with hidden details for fans to discover.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p>That's a glimpse into my illustration process for both personal and professional work. Starting with thorough research and planning allows me to create more cohesive and engaging pieces. Remember, the more you <strong>connect with your artwork</strong>, the more it resonates with others.</p>
