<p>Welcome to Section Two of the portrait painting chapter. In this section, we'll dive into some <strong>sculpture studies</strong>. I strongly recommend doing these studies, especially if you're a beginner and the thought of painting a full-color portrait feels intimidating. This is a great segue because we'll focus on values, simplifying the process.</p>

<p>The <strong>old masters</strong> did a fantastic job of simplifying forms, making them easier to identify and well-designed. They also excelled at <strong>designing hair</strong> into large shapes and clumps. We'll focus on that in our first sketch.</p>

<p>These studies will help us bridge the gap to full-color portraits, which we'll tackle in the following sections.</p>

<h2>Gestural Studies</h2>

<h3>First Gesture Study</h3>

<p>For the first study, we'll focus on <strong>gesture</strong>. I like to use a rough <strong>Loomis approach</strong>:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Block in the cranium</strong> with a sphere.</li>

<li>Indicate the <strong>brow line</strong>.</li>

<li>Cut the head in half vertically to find the center.</li>

<li>Pull out the <strong>front of the face mask</strong>.</li>

<li>Roughly block in the <strong>neck</strong> and <strong>hair shape</strong>.</li>

</ul>

<p>I use <strong>graphic straight lines</strong> to ensure the angles are correct. Then, I add small dashes to indicate features like the <strong>eyebrow</strong>, <strong>eye corner</strong>, and <strong>nose gesture</strong>. Starting with basic shapes serves as placeholders that I can refine later.</p>

<p><strong>Remember</strong>: Always start with the <strong>larger shapes</strong> and work your way down to the smaller details. This approach gives a strong foundation to build upon.</p>

<p>I'm indicating strong cast shadows with thin, crisp lines and core shadows with thicker, softer lines. I keep the shadow shapes graphic by adding a flat value, focusing on the modeling in the light areas.</p>

<p>I also pay attention to <strong>line variety</strong>, using a mix of thick and thin, soft and crisp lines to add depth and vibrancy to the sketch.</p>

<h3>Learnings from the First Gesture</h3>

<h4>Observing the Reference Image</h4>

<p>I love how the artist organized the <strong>structure of the hair</strong> in the reference sculpture. They created large masses and designed the shapes into <strong>big, medium, and small</strong> clumps. This creates an overall <strong>flow</strong> that makes the hair feel attached to the scalp.</p>

<p>When drawing hair, following consistent flows and rhythms helps it feel more natural and connected to the head.</p>

<h4>Studying Planes and Lighting in Sculptures</h4>

<p>Studying sculptures makes it easier to see the planes of the face. The <strong>eyes</strong>, <strong>lips</strong>, and <strong>nose</strong> are simplified, allowing us to see where edges need to be sharper or softer. It's also easier to study <strong>lighting</strong> because the core shadows, cast shadows, and midtones are more apparent.</p>

<p>This is why sculpture studies are a great exercise, they help us learn the planes of the face and anatomy in general.</p>

<h2>Black and White Value Study</h2>

<h3>Second Study: Benjamin Franklin Bust</h3>

<p>For our second study, we'll work on a <strong>black and white value study</strong> using the bust of <strong>Benjamin Franklin</strong>. The lighting on this sculpture is appealing, and we'll focus on the <strong>anatomy of lighting</strong>, separating lights and darks, and designing shapes in an appealing way.</p>

<p>Starting with black and white is a great first step for those learning painting. It teaches you how to control your <strong>values</strong>, which translates directly to color painting.</p>

<h3>Blocking In the Gesture</h3>

<p>I center my reference image and start by:</p>

<ul>

<li>Drawing a light <strong>circle</strong> for the cranium.</li>

<li>Adding to the front of the circle to capture the <strong>mass of the face</strong>.</li>

<li>Blocking in the <strong>brow line</strong>.</li>

<li>Adding a smaller circle to describe the <strong>side of the head</strong>.</li>

</ul>

<p>I represent corners with <strong>straight lines</strong> to graphically design the shapes before rendering. Watching my <strong>angles</strong> and <strong>points of comparison</strong> is crucial for capturing a likeness. I use straight lines to connect points and ensure features align correctly.</p>

<p>I block in features like the <strong>nose</strong>, <strong>eyes</strong>, <strong>chin</strong>, and <strong>lip line</strong>, drawing parallel lines to maintain symmetry. I also use alignment techniques, like drawing a line from the tear duct down to the neck, to place features accurately.</p>

<h3>Developing the Value Study</h3>

<p>After refining the gesture, I:</p>

<ol>

<li><strong>Flatten the sketch</strong> and darken the composition slightly.</li>

<li><strong>Graphically separate</strong> the lights and darks using a textured brush.</li>

<li><strong>Carve out shapes</strong>, editing as I paint in the values.</li>

<li><strong>Fix the eyes</strong>, as they're crucial to the portrait.</li>

<li><strong>Chisel in the planes</strong>, softening edges with a blender brush.</li>

<li><strong>Block in midtones</strong>, adding depth to the face.</li>

<li>Use a <strong>multiply layer</strong> to ensure the darks are darker than the lights.</li>

<li><strong>Squint my eyes</strong> to check the separation of lights and darks.</li>

</ol>

<p>I add <strong>dark accents</strong> in the areas of occlusion, places where light can't reach, like under the nose and between the lips. Then, I <strong>flatten everything</strong> and start adding the <strong>highlights</strong>, which are like the icing on the cake.</p>

<h3>Importance of Value Control</h3>

<p>Controlling values is essential. When you squint your eyes, you should see a clear separation between the <strong>light shapes</strong> and <strong>dark shapes</strong>. Avoid letting values in the shadow areas become as light as those in the lit areas, as this can make the image look muddy.</p>

<h2>Final Notes and Takeaways</h2>

<h3>Separating Lights and Darks</h3>

<p>A strong separation of lights and darks is vital. When I squint, the lights should merge into one shape, and the darks should do the same. This clarity makes the painting read well from a distance.</p>

<h3>Use of Core Shadows, Cast Shadows, and Occlusion Shadows</h3>

<ul>

<li><strong>Core Shadows</strong>: Softer shadows where the form turns away from the light.</li>

<li><strong>Cast Shadows</strong>: Hard-edged shadows cast by an object blocking the light.</li>

<li><strong>Occlusion Shadows</strong>: The darkest areas where light can't reach at all.</li>

</ul>

<p>Understanding and applying these correctly adds depth and realism.</p>

<h3>Variety in Line Work and Brushstrokes</h3>

<p>Using a variety of <strong>brushstrokes</strong> and <strong>line work</strong>, thick and thin, soft and crisp, adds energy and vibrancy to the piece. Larger brushstrokes for large shapes and finer details for small areas create a pleasing hierarchy.</p>

<h3>The Importance of Hierarchy in Detail</h3>

<p>Design your painting with <strong>large areas of rest</strong> and <strong>small areas of detail</strong>. This balance keeps the viewer's eye engaged without overwhelming them.</p>

<h3>Effective Painting Process Overview</h3>

<ol>

<li><strong>Block out local values</strong> first.</li>

<li><strong>Separate your lights and darks</strong> graphically.</li>

<li>Define your <strong>core shadows</strong> and <strong>cast shadows</strong>.</li>

<li>Add <strong>gradients</strong> where necessary.</li>

<li>Save <strong>dark accents</strong> and <strong>highlights</strong> for last.</li>

</ol>

<p>This approach builds a strong foundation and makes the painting process more manageable.</p>

<h2>Next Steps</h2>

<p>With the value studies complete, we're ready to move on to the <strong>full-color portrait painting</strong>. These exercises have prepared us by reinforcing the importance of values, shapes, and the efficient structuring of a portrait.</p>
