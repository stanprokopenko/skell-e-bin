<h2>Merging Layers and Preparing for Color</h2>

<p>Now that we've got a nice value base, we're going to add color. I merge all my layers down so we have a single layer to work with. This means we lose the ability to select individual elements easily, but we can clean up as we go.</p>

<h2>Applying Local Colors with Layer Modes</h2>

<p>Just like we did with our local values, we're going to separate them into <strong>local colors</strong> now. I start by selecting the skin. It doesn't have to be perfect, we can clean up afterwards. I'm leaving out the eye for now.</p>

<p>Using the magical <strong>Color</strong> layer mode, I choose a skin color. At first, it might look <strong>too saturated</strong>, but you'll notice it keeps our <strong>value structure</strong> semi-intact. We can adjust the intensity and the color, building it up over time.</p>

<p>Next, I select the hair. If you're using the lasso tool and want to select with straight lines, just hold <strong>Alt</strong>. Let's have some fun and maybe give her <strong>blue hair</strong> to create a warm-cool contrast. Switching the layer to <strong>Color</strong> mode, we get something to work with. It might be too intense, so we can knock it down a bit.</p>

<p>I recommend trying out different <strong>layer modes</strong>, <strong>Multiply</strong>, <strong>Overlay</strong>, <strong>Soft Light</strong>, <strong>Vivid Light</strong>. To be honest, I don't always know what they all do, but sometimes I just test them out to see what looks good. We're going to merge it down anyway, so this is just about playing around and giving us a base to start with.</p>

<p>If you've never worked with color before, this is a good way to start, just playing around with some things.</p>

<h2>Adding Color Variation to the Skin</h2>

<p>To make the skin feel less flat, I like to add some <strong>color variation</strong>. With Caucasian skin, I might add a bit of <strong>red in the ears and nose</strong>, maybe even <strong>yellow in the forehead</strong>. You might have seen images showing the <strong>color zones of the face</strong>, but I don't like going too heavy with them. It's really a taste thing at the end of the day.</p>

<p>I might go a bit overboard at first, because we can always <strong>knock it back</strong>. Using a separate layer for the skin, I can adjust opacity if it is too heavy. We can start at nothing and slowly nudge it up to where it feels believable, maybe around <strong>65 to 80 percent</strong> opacity.</p>

<p>I also like to add <strong>cooler tones in the shadows</strong> to create more contrast with the warmth of the face. Again, this is about adding interest and making it feel less flat.</p>

<h2>Adding Texture to the Skin</h2>

<p>At this stage, I like to add a little bit of <strong>texture</strong> to the skin as well. This can come in the form of freckles, moles, or birthmarks. We can do this quickly with the <strong>Multiply</strong> layer mode. I might add some beauty spots or indications of freckles on the nose. As we paint over these, they'll fade into the distance, but they add a bit of <strong>character</strong>, something just a little bit different.</p>

<p>I might come back and add a bit more <strong>red in the cheeks</strong>. I want to be careful not to overdo it because it can look a little funny if you do too much.</p>

<h2>Merging and Painting on Top</h2>

<p>Now, this is still a base for me because we're going to merge it and then <strong>paint on top</strong>. This gives us a nice <strong>palette</strong> to work with. Once again, I merge the layers, duplicate, and we're going to just <strong>paint</strong>, thinking about our <strong>lights and darks</strong>.</p>

<p>At this point, we can even use the <strong>smudge tool</strong> if we want. We can smudge some areas to blend them, but we don't want to smudge everything. I seldom use the smudge tool early on because it can make everything a bit <strong>muddy</strong>. I'd rather have my <strong>values delineated</strong> before I start playing around with it.</p>

<h2>Adding Specular Highlights</h2>

<p>I want to start adding some <strong>specular highlights</strong> that we talked about before. We can use the <strong>Screen</strong> layer mode for this. You'll notice that if we get all the <strong>values</strong> feeling right, this looks curved.</p>

<p>I think of lighting typically in two ways: <strong>matte finish</strong> and <strong>specular highlights</strong>. The matte finish is our base, and the specular highlights represent the <strong>shininess</strong> of the object that's reflecting the environment around it, often a <strong>light source</strong>.</p>

<p>For example, we can quickly make the eyelid look shiny by adding a specular highlight. That's what everyone wants to draw, the fun thing that really makes things <strong>pop</strong>. But without an underlying understanding of the <strong>form</strong>, it won't make any sense and it might not look quite right.</p>

<p>We're looking for similar <strong>planes</strong> that are going to reflect the light. So, the plane on the eyelid might be similar to planes on the nose, the corner of the lip, or the cheekbone. This is how you start to get a <strong>cohesive feeling</strong>.</p>

<p>Not everything is going to be super shiny, but there are parts of the face I like to punch up with specular highlights, like the inner eye section or the eyebrows. Even if the reference doesn't show a specular highlight because of how the lid is across the eye, there's nothing stopping us from adding one in if it looks right. If it looks right, it is right.</p>

<h2>Blocking in the Highlights and Rim Light</h2>

<p>I might block in the highlights now, even though we're not near finished. I just want to start blocking that in so I don't lose where I'm at. I'll add that <strong>rim light</strong> here.</p>

<p>I might adjust the background so we can see the contrast with the rim light. The lighting was really the main part that caught my eye, so that's what we're going to focus on.</p>

<p>We'll notice that it's not just a line going straight down the edge of the face or head. We want to make sure we understand the <strong>forms of the face</strong> so we can duck in where it makes sense. For example, the plane of the chin might catch more light, and we can indicate that accordingly.</p>

<p>Once we've got this, we can continue to <strong>refine</strong>. We can erase areas if it's too intense and adjust as we go.</p>

<h2>Understanding Light Interaction and Subsurface Scattering</h2>

<p>Everything that a <strong>light source touches becomes a light source itself</strong>, and it also takes on the properties of that thing. For example, light reflected from skin becomes a <strong>skin-colored light</strong>. That's going to reflect onto other areas, like under the chin, where we might get more <strong>saturated colors</strong>.</p>

<p>That's a little tip that has really helped me make light feel that little bit more realistic. Instead of just doing a <strong>white light</strong> under the chin, which can wash it out, I'd like to see something way more saturated. We can layer that on, reducing the opacity if needed, to create that illusion of a <strong>glow</strong>.</p>

<p>Speaking of glowy effects, in areas where the skin is thin, like the nostrils, the light is pretty harsh. We can come through and use <strong>Color Dodge</strong> to add intense saturation, giving us that nice illusion of <strong>subsurface scattering</strong>.</p>

<p>We can look at the reference and see where to add such effects, even along the nose or around the head. I've decided not to do a massive plane of light on the forehead because I think that would take away from the whole piece.</p>

<p>I might even go around the whole thing and add more of that subsurface scattering. <strong>Why not?</strong> We can always knock it back to see how it feels.</p>

<h2>Refining the Painting</h2>

<p>Now, we can merge the layers and continue refining. We keep going back and forth, adjusting colors, values, and details. We need to be cautious with tools like the smudge tool and layer modes to avoid <strong>overdoing it</strong>. We're building up the painting gradually, adding subtlety and depth.</p>

<p>Once you start to understand how light works and how to manipulate it, you can start to really make your paintings come alive. It's about slowly building up, understanding the forms, the light, and how they interact.</p>

<p>Remember, we're not trying to be a thousand percent physically accurate, but rather to create something that feels right. If it looks right, it is right. Keep experimenting, have fun, and don't feel like you have to make the right decision every single time.</p>
