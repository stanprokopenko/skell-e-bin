<h2>Understanding Interior Lighting</h2>

<p>Interiors are quite different from exteriors. There's not the same level of atmosphere and weather effects. Interiors require a lot more choice because there are <strong>electric light sources</strong>, <strong>natural light sources</strong>, and we have to consider <strong>where the windows are</strong>. What elements do we want to use to get the depth? <strong>Time of day</strong> still plays heavily into this, and then the use of <strong>ambient light</strong> and <strong>ambient occlusion</strong> is far more detailed.</p>

<h2>Starting with a Simple Sketch</h2>

<p>Let me show you the process. I started with a very simple, scribbly sketch. You might remember this from my earlier storyboard planning. It was basic, basic, basic. I had a picture in my mind, but I want to show you how simple and scribbly concept art can be. Sometimes you see things that professionals do, and you're like, "I can't do that. There's a point at which my artwork just looks terrible." Well, there's a point where everybody's artwork looks terrible. Sometimes they just curate it out of their videos and don't show it to you. And the more experience you get, the shorter this period becomes. So I just wanted to show you this terrible sketch, but in my mind, I'm thinking about the design.</p>

<p>I'm actually designing my interior. I'm thinking: you're walking into this old hotel or haunted mansion. It's almost like a big lobby with a curved, large stairway. Halfway up, there's a big window. There's a sculpture that has like a dragon shape. Then maybe there's a second-floor balcony, and along the sides, there are doors that lead to hotel rooms or other rooms in this mansion/hotel.</p>

<h2>Mocking Up in 3D</h2>

<p>Instead of drawing this all in 2D by hand, I decided to mock this up in 3D. I used <strong>Maya</strong>. I've been using Maya since it first came out, since it was beta in 1997-98. As a guide, instead of having to hand-track all of my perspective, I like using 3D. I can put in cubes, cylinders, spheres, and custom-modeled a couple of the elements: the walls, this window, the curve of the stairs, and the stairwell. I created these using basic 3D. Then I can do a line guide over top of that, and now use this as my base for my drawing.</p>

<p>I'm not doing a full 3D scene. I'm not building everything out. Just within 20 minutes of mocking up primitives and playing with the camera angle to have an interesting perspective. See how my perspective lines give me a three-point perspective for this? The lines go off to a horizon line about here, and then there's another one that's kind of going up. You can see the columns kind of tilt up. So it's a very wide-angle 12mm lens to see this whole room.</p>

<p>Then I took this guide and sketched over it and came up with this design. So this is the room that I'm working with. I wanted to show you that process of refining as well. This is great for illustrations: start with a loose sketch, then mock it up, and do your design.</p>

<h2>Considering Lighting Choices</h2>

<p>Let's go back to our references. We painted different loose storyboards. If we chose one of those outside, misty, foggy days, we just have to make a choice: <strong>What do you see inside the house?</strong> Even if it's foggy out or it's sunny out, there's a certain amount of light that will come through this window. Will there be direct sunlight, or will there just be the cool of the sky? How cool will it be? How bright do we want this space to be? If it's full night and there's no light coming through that window, it's going to make it a very different type of exposure in this scene.</p>

<p>We know we want something glowing there. That's the big thing, **Do we want window light or not? ** I kind of like the idea of seeing the window as a silhouette. So if we just have soft light that comes through a window and there's a bit of mist and fog in the room, classic movie style, the character can come from this bright, sunny world into this darker place that's lit only with the cool of the sky. Then it's almost like a two-tone again, this very neutral. Maybe this will be a little bit cooler.</p>

<h2>Gathering References</h2>

<p>Let me look at some interior references.</p>

<ul>

<li>

<p><strong>"All Quiet on the Western Front"</strong> - This is daylight, and there's that mist and fog. I like the specular highlights, the mystery of this, the darkness of this room. There's no lamps on. It just feels empty, and you can still see everything, well, you can see enough. The fog overwrites the look of this room, so it's very lighting centric. It's not like they had so much fill light, you could see what's on the bookshelves. It really is just these little bits of specular highlights, and fog.</p>

</li>

<li>

<p><strong>"The Crown" and "The Prestige"</strong>: Here's another interior that has sunlight. I do like there's fog in this room, clearly coming in, and the soft glow.</p>

</li>

<li>

<p><strong>"Love, Death, and Robots"</strong>: I like this feeling. I think we should attempt something like this.</p>

</li>

<li>

<p><strong>"Skyfall"</strong>: This one does have some sunlight. It might be worth experimenting, just trying two different versions: one with a little bit of sun and one that's just cool from the sky.</p>

</li>

</ul>

<h2>Starting the Painting</h2>

<p>Let's start painting this idea. I can do this off the top of my head or I can look at reference. I'm going to make a duplicate of this image and make it smaller so we have our thumbnail version that we can assess down here. I'm going to take my line art and pull its opacity down a little bit, just enough to give me a guide, and I'm going to start painting on this layer underneath.</p>

<p>We want it to be kind of neutral, so the main thing I'm going to fill with a neutral-ish, cool-ish color, the <strong>cool of the sky</strong>. So whether it's foggy out or sunny out, there's no direct sun that is really hitting the back of this building. I'm going to make a bigger brush, and make some <strong>ambient occlusion</strong>. Under the stairs, it's going to have a big soft shadow, and it is going to be darker under the stairs for sure. The farther back you get into these recesses, the more it's going to be occluded. Occluded means to be hidden by, to be obscured.</p>

<p>I know that the character is going to come into this space, and there'll be darkness in those little coves back there. Same with up here, there'll be some darkness. But I know that we're going to have light. Let me go ahead and paint some. There's going to be some fog in here. I'm going to make it kind of bright at the back, and then work my way to the front with the fog that will be lit by the light of this window. And some of this light will be hitting these columns. It's diffuse and fog at the same time, and I'm just seeing some of that light.</p>

<p>Again, I'm looking at my little thumbnail, and then there'll be a really bright spot where the actual light outside the window is.</p>

<h2>Adding the Silhouetted Dragon</h2>

<p>I know that I have my dragon sculpture that will be kind of silhouetted right here. I want that to be high contrast enough to really draw my eye to look at that. That's my <strong>focal point</strong>. It's similar to the reference where you have a character in front of the window, it's going to make high contrast. Definitely, this is the focal point of the shot. This is the second focal point because I see a human form, and there is some little highlights. So we're going to do a similar type of thing.</p>

<h2>Building Up the Scene</h2>

<p>Blending this to where it all feels appropriate is key. So similar to the outside, things in the foreground will most likely be darker because there's less fog in front of that. Well, let me just get the ambient occlusion in first before I share too many different ideas of potential things that we can do. I just want to see a general darkening as you get closer to the camera. I want to see some fog in there. I want to see kind of the base shapes and forms in a kind of blurry version.</p>

<p>I'm going to try making a <strong>linear dodge add mode layer</strong> and see if I can give this extra bloom glow around that window. I really want to feel like very, very soft fog coming down the stairs, and we could definitely use this to rim light our character. See what that fog does? It helps a lot.</p>

<h2>Refining the Values</h2>

<p>Let's merge these two together, and I'm back to a regular paintbrush. Make that nice and small because my secondary source will be like, I want to see some of that brighter light onto my character that's walking into this space. See how quickly we can just kind of get a mood and a feeling into this? Once I have that, I can come back and paint in the smaller details. I can find the colors that I've already found in these gradients. Just kind of clean up these edges, make certain things darker, make certain things lighter.</p>

<p>Think about how do I get some rim light onto these objects that I think look like plants that are here. I can add extra rims and extra little <strong>specular highlights</strong> onto some of these elements.</p>

<h2>Considering Material Choices</h2>

<p>I have to start making some choices at this stage, especially with interiors. <strong>What is everything made out of?</strong> Is the floor made out of planks of wood, or is the floor made out of stone? Is that stone polished? What material choices will play into whether there are specular highlights? And of course, I need to start thinking about <strong>local colors</strong>.</p>

<p>So right now, with these really foggy setups, I don't really have a lot of local color. I have been very light-centric to just dominate the image with the fog so you can't see the local color. But maybe in this case, these couches are red, and maybe this carpet on the floor is also some sort of warm color. So we're going to have to put that in and figure out in this cool light, what are those colors?</p>

<h2>Focusing on Values First</h2>

<p>But first, I just want to get the blocking of my light, <strong>my values overall</strong>. It is really important to think about values early on and not get caught where you have too many conflicting values. You should really keep this simple first. That's why there's a philosophy that I follow of <strong>putting the light in first</strong>, finding your local color and material second. And that's backwards from some other people's workflows. There's no right way or wrong way. I just find this easier to do so that the lighting can really shine, so to say, in this case, and not have too many competing colors that don't fit into the space.</p>

<p>This is a different way to think about value, not just value by itself, but <strong>value within the context of this lighting</strong>.</p>

<h2>Smoothing and Blending</h2>

<p>I'm doing a little bit more small detail, soft shadows, ambient occlusion of this dragon. And let's just kind of judge the whole thing. Maybe I'm going to smooth this out. So I'm going to switch to the <strong>mixer brush</strong>. With these particular settings, it turns into just a smooth blender. So I can soften these lines a little bit, get some of that extra texture that was in the brush, and simplify it. I can get things kind of in their place, clean up some lines, clean up some of that mess, spread certain gradients out.</p>

<p>There'll be a soft shadow under the chair, so I'm just going to blend this a little bit. Any areas that are smooshy, I want to clean up, try to get this where it really feels appropriate for the scene. My goal is to make this feel like it is a believable gradient in this thumbnail, and if it is, then we're doing a good job. And if it's not, we've got to refine that a bit more.</p>

<p>If I turn off my line art, does it still read? Does it look like a room? Right now it's just one light source, just that one window, and it's getting close.</p>

<h2>Experimenting with Additional Light Sources</h2>

<p>Do I change some local colors now, or do I experiment more with the light? I think I actually want to experiment with light because we can fix colors. Just want to try: <strong>Do we want other light sources in this scene?</strong> Oh, we have the <strong>glowing orb</strong> that it's going for. I think we've got to put that in and just make this a really simple two-color scene.</p>

<p>I have all kinds of light sources in my sketch. I have lamps at the edge of, if I turn this back up, I’ve got lamps here at the edge of the table. Let me just draw in. I'm going to do it on its own layer again. I could choose, like, if we wanted this to be a happy scene that walks into, and there's not as much mystery, we could be like, a little lamp over here and a lamp over here, and there's ones above the doors, and above these doors. Maybe there's some sort of chandelier from above that could have a pool of light into the scene.</p>

<p>If I make a new layer that has add mode again, I can give a nice soft glow around these light sources as if they are lighting a little table and onto this chair. Just doing this the fast version. Around the top of these doors, and maybe a little bit into the scene, there's a rim light onto these columns. Little pools of light in and out of bright spots to dark spots, and a transition in between will make it very kind of cozy, happy. And it looks like the power's on, it is an active hotel. That is one way to go about this.</p>

<p>But <strong>how creepy do we want this to feel?</strong> Do we want those level of lights? Maybe not. I've got it on its own layer so I can experiment with this. So I can take these two layers. Let's just turn these off for now.</p>

<h2>Adding the Glowing Orb</h2>

<p>I'm going to make one that is the glow of our little stone. So let's make this a deep dark red. It's in add mode and it's coming from right here. I want some glow around this, and then right at the center there's going to be like a bright spot. Definitely be some light that's coming up onto the belly of the dragon and onto the arms of the dragon to just kind of draw attention.</p>

<p>Let me turn off that line layer again. Definitely has that kind of glow. We could paint in maybe some glow onto the stairs. We do have some competition that is happening right now. So that light from behind the dragon and the light in front of the dragon, they're kind of competing with each other. So it is a little bit difficult from that point. I still think we can make it work.</p>

<p>If we had something bright enough right in the core there, let's make this a little smaller and like there's a really high contrast little thing there, I still think it could work. It's bright enough to catch some light underneath. That looks pretty cool, and it's competing with the soft of the sky. Maybe it comes down the stairs a little bit, and slowly fades out as it goes down the stairs.</p>

<h2>Enhancing with Specular Highlights</h2>

<p>Maybe we even do a little hint of that warm light onto the character and onto some of these foreground elements. If the pillars are made out of a marble, which I have painted them to be that way, we're going to get some <strong>specular highlights</strong> from that glowing source there. So this is all marble. Maybe we paint in those little reflections of that bright, and it will, again, tell us so much about the material and that that really is a pretty bright spot to draw our eyes. I kind of like this. This is looking pretty cool.</p>

<p>Maybe under the nose of our dragon, anything that's kind of facing towards that light source, I want to have a little bit of light. We could experiment with a little bit of light coming onto the ceiling as well. How bright is it? How far does that light spread? That's pretty cool.</p>

<h2>Merging and Refining</h2>

<p>I'm going to go ahead and commit and merge these two layers, and turn off my line art. There needs to be a little bit more occlusion up top. So in the ceiling, like if I turn off the line art, you really can't see the ceiling. I think that there would be some darkening of these curved ceiling beams, and then maybe I'll just put a little dark line for each of them, just to kind of define that soft shadow in between each of these beams. It doesn't need to be highly detailed for my color key, just enough to inform the artist that might light this scene or yourself if you're doing an illustration of what are the elements minus the line art.</p>

<p>Turn that off. See? Yeah, it's starting to get some shape and form. I have little plants that are on the side that have kind of been obliterated, so let me repaint these in. I like that feeling of like there are shapes of different value that helps break up this scene, and those shapes can get maybe even a little bit of rim light onto them to add complexity to the scene. Little details.</p>

<p>Maybe the bottom of the staircase has these little spikes on it. I want to see the steps just enough. Depending on how long you want to take to paint your color key, how detailed do you need it? What is your team doing? What do you need for yourself? I could spend the next three or four hours turning this into a polished illustration and using this as a guide, or I could say I'm going to hand this off to a 3D lighting artist, and they'll get all of the rest into this, and they'll get all the accurate contact shadows and all the little details of this.</p>

<h2>Adjusting Local Color</h2>

<p><strong>Local color</strong>. Let's come back to local color. In this foggy lighting setup, if I want this carpet to be red, everything is dominated with fog. If I go and I choose a red, let me do it on its own layer, and paint this, it's going to feel too strong. So even if I have a similar value and just do that value in red, it is going to stand out. It's not going to feel really believable.</p>

<p>So here's a trick that I think is a great way to work. Instead of just actually shifting your color wheel around to those colors, <strong>color relativity</strong> says that in blue light, red will be darker. There's not as much of an effect, and so let's desaturate a little and pull it towards purple and paint this now because red in a cool setting will be more purple. I still have the cool of the room in here. Maybe I make this a little bit darker.</p>

<p>Notice I'm almost completely desaturated, and it still feels warm. What's strange about this is that I could actually make this green, and it will still feel warm. So wild. No matter what, I can make it blue, and it will feel warm. I can make it yellow, and it'll feel warm because it's pretty much gray. It's just this dark gray, but because there's so much blue in this scene, we are getting that impression that there's this warm color. It's a trick of your eye.</p>

<p>So as long as we have something that gives that impression of warm, we can work with that. So maybe these couches are also a warm kind of velvet color. So it's just a desaturated gray in this really warm environment. It gives the impression of some material on the floor itself.</p>

<h2>Adding Specular Reflections</h2>

<p>What if the floor is kind of marble? So maybe there's some specular reflections of this glowing thing there. Oh, let me get the tail of the dragon a little bit darker. That'd be nice to see a bit more of that tail shape and shadow. But if the stairs are picking up a specular highlight right there, that will say, yep, the floor is glossy. There will also be a specular highlight of that window in there, that'll be glossy too.</p>

<p>I'm going to shift my mind into a mindset of <strong>specular</strong>. Specular is a reflection that is brighter. There's a diffuse reflection and a specular reflection. Again, more things to observe with light. So any object in here that is shiny will catch some specular highlights of both that warm light source and this kind of cool blue.</p>

<p>And I can use this. I can take advantage of this to help give shape and form to my elements. So this couch, the edges of it, I'm going to use that specular highlight as a way to communicate its shape and its form. Just these little tiny specular hits will be like, oh yeah, that's a couch, and that has some little bits of sheen to it.</p>

<h2>Final Touches</h2>

<p>Make the front of the character have a little bit more rim light there. And then the last things that I'll want to do is just a little bit of extra <strong>ambient occlusion</strong> around these doorways and around these picture frames on the wall, just slight variations that will tell me more about the space. There could be some specular differences that we could put into here as well, but I just want to get variations in value and color, which will help me understand this space as much as possible.</p>

<p>The base of this column could be a little bit darker so that it really stands out against the wall. Maybe inside of these, the railing. Again, the whole goal is to be able to <strong>turn off my line art and still be able to understand everything</strong> that's happening in this scene. I want to see the columns, I want to see the arches, I want to see the details. I need a little bit more work through here.</p>

<p>It can stay really scribbly though. There's a lot that can be conveyed through this very loose sketch. Maybe up in the stairs there's a little bit of extra darkening up here too. Maybe these beams also have a little bit of dark in them. I think that looks pretty good for a color key.</p>

<h2>Experimenting with Sunlight</h2>

<p>Do we want to do sunlight onto this as well? I wouldn't suggest doing that, but let me just do one more. Let me just experiment with this to say this is now an add layer. Let's make a warm light source. Let's look at the reference from "Skyfall" where there actually is a pool of light.</p>

<p>What's nice about the pool of light is it can bounce up into the scene. We can utilize <strong>bounce light</strong>, <strong>indirect light</strong>, as a light source to give us more information. So if there was a couple of options that we can do here, maybe there's light that is coming from the door. Like if this was outside, we could have sunlight kind of coming in onto the back of the character, and then flooding, you know, maybe we see their shadow and there's their head, you know, like this long light from the door. If we had sunlight, if it was backlit, that is one way to draw even more attention to this character.</p>

<p>I want to experiment with all of my options. I think that this doesn't really help the composition. I think having that off probably works better. But what if there is a pool of light that comes through, maybe this window is super bright. There is more sunlight that is coming through, and then there's like, let's say the sun is coming in at this angle, so we can make a nice strong rim onto the back of this dragon.</p>

<p>Maybe there is a little pool of sunlight that works its way through the scene, shines down onto the floor. I want to experiment. We use this as a pool of light to help make that character pop out.</p>

<h2>Using Bounce Light</h2>

<p>Now let's do bounce light from that. So if that sun hits right there, there's going to be an explosion of light that will kind of come up into the scene like what we did with that street lamp out front. Everything now will have light that is coming from that. This is now my light source, so there'll be a big kind of glow of light around here.</p>

<p>Everything slowly will get, like the stairs will now get, these plants will get light that is coming from that explosion. Even back here, we will get some of it. Up top, under these edges, and there would probably be some even on these doorways back here. Can you see how powerful of an idea this is to play with?</p>

<p>Now put that pool of light, move it around. What if it's right here in the front? What if it's over on the right? We can do so many things with this. If there's sunlight, maybe I'll do one more for a <strong>god ray</strong> of light into this. Let's do a very soft, like this is the sunlight itself shining into the scene.</p>

<p>I think that the sun doesn't help with that jewel. My eye isn't drawn to that, so I don't think that this is really serving us. But I just want to look at the composition and see there's lots of different options. Let me turn those off and say one more thing that we could experiment with is a <strong>top-down light</strong>.</p>

<h2>Experimenting with Top-Down Light</h2>

<p>So if I do just a cool kind of pool of light as if there's a hole in the ceiling, I could fill a little bit more of this space down here with some softer light from above. That'll help the character stand out. We could give some shape onto the tops of objects that is coming from directly on top.</p>

<p>This is another thing that is done in film all the time. Doesn't always have to make sense where those light sources are coming from. We just want to be able to shape the characters in the scene, to really be able to tell what's happening. <strong>Who are we looking at?</strong> ** Maybe the top of these stairs will catch some of that light, these ones here, catch some of that, the dragon's tail, catch some top light, and it's just kind of a pool right into this area, kind of like this big. It's just kind of a soft top light, it fills the scene.</p>

<p>See what it does with and without that. I don't know, it adds something. We could take this because it's on its own layer, and we could take its opacity down just to see if it adds a little something or if it turns it all to mush. It makes the character pop a little bit more. We could erase away some of this where the character is to make the character stand out even more too, because I'm in add mode, so if I remove the character from it, now it's a little bit more light on the ground versus fog or bloom in the lens.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p>So this was the process of painting color keys. They're not final illustrations, they're just little sketches to explore what the light can be. I encourage you to <strong>learn more about light</strong>, as much as you can about how light works, about how materials work, and then go and <strong>experiment</strong>.</p>

<p>I will be providing these sketches, my little bit more refined sketches of the interior and the exterior, for you to play with. Go look for <strong>good references</strong> and try different colors in there. Try to <strong>extract the lighting from your references</strong>, and not just the color palettes. Let's even get that ambient light, that atmosphere, those reflections, anything that you see in your reference, and try painting into these scenes.</p>
