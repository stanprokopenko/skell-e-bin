<p>In our last lesson, we learned that there are multiple ways to create the <strong>illusion</strong> of depth in drawing. Some methods are easy, while others require more effort. Let's explore how to solve them all with a <strong>single skill</strong>.</p>

<h2>Easy Illusions: Overlap and Atmosphere</h2>

<p>Two of our illusionary tricks are straightforward:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Overlap</strong>: Super simple, objects overlapping create depth.</li>

<li><strong>Atmosphere</strong> - Things fade into the background, no brainer.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Difficult Illusions: Foreshortening, Diminution, and Convergence</h2>

<p>Three of the secrets take study and practice:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Foreshortening</strong>: Not as easy as it looks. Beginners seldom dare to tackle it.</li>

<li><strong>Diminution</strong>: Easy to estimate when precision isn't crucial, but less so when you need exactness.</li>

<li><strong>Convergence to Vanishing Points</strong>: Not hard to know they exist, but not always easy to locate them.</li>

</ul>

<p><strong>Foreshortening</strong>, well-placed <strong>vanishing points</strong>, and precise <strong>shrinking in the distance</strong> are difficult skills. But we shall pursue them, and this lesson's project will show you why.</p>

<h2>Solving with a Single Skill: Simplifying Complex Forms</h2>

<p>There's one major skill that solves all these problems once you've mastered it: <strong>reducing a complex form into a simple one that you can draw in any position</strong>. That is <strong>the skill</strong>.</p>

<p>If your goal is to not just copy but to <strong>look and reinvent your image</strong>, here's how you <strong>won't</strong> learn to do that:</p>

<ul>

<li>Draw an object.</li>

<li><strong>Copy</strong> what you see.</li>

<li>Take pains to get it <strong>exact</strong>.</li>

<li>Put in <strong>lots of detail</strong>.</li>

<li>Now, draw it again in a different position <strong>without looking</strong> at the object in that position.</li>

<li><strong>Make it up</strong>.</li>

</ul>

<p>Can't do it?</p>

<h2>The Limitations of Copying</h2>

<p><strong>Copying</strong> may help you notice detail, but it won't help you redraw the thing with the detail in another position. That takes <strong>skill with form</strong>.</p>

<h2>The Method: Simplifying and Repositioning Objects</h2>

<p>Let me show you how to learn that:</p>

<ol>

<li><strong>Draw an object as a simplified form</strong> - a box, for example.</li>

<li>In another position, <strong>draw the box again</strong>.</li>

</ol>

<p>Now you have <strong>line systems</strong>. Those are the secret. They will take time.</p>

<p>We can't reposition until we establish a <strong>structure</strong>. Once you position a box, its <strong>three line systems</strong> solve all other lines. This is a secret that many don't know. Most of this course is about that and how to apply it to things and to settings.</p>

<h3>Using Line Systems</h3>

<p>Objects and settings have <strong>line systems</strong>. Right-angled streets, for example. Streets are not objects so much as environments, where lines may mean long distances, even a journey. We'll get to settings after we've learned to draw objects. They have lots in common.</p>

<h2>Starting Simple: Avoiding Complex Objects</h2>

<p>Some objects are difficult, objects with lots of parts, ins and outs, lots of oblique angles. These are too much for beginners. The same with anatomy. <strong>Hands</strong>, for example, are complex objects, 16 forms, movable, not for beginners.</p>

<p>Skeletal studies, turning the bones into 3D components, such things are for artists who know this already or aspire to this. That's where we're going, but <strong>don't start there</strong>. The same with any organic forms, animal bodies, muscle masses. Hang in there for that. Before we learn complex organic forms, we learn <strong>simple blocky ones</strong>.</p>

<h2>The Project: Challenging Yourself</h2>

<p><strong>Challenge yourself</strong>. See if you need perspective.</p>

<h3>Steps of the Project</h3>

<ol>

<li><strong>Choose something worthy to study</strong>. I recommend something <strong>boxy</strong> or already simplified.</li>

<li>Place it in <strong>three-quarter view</strong>.</li>

<li><strong>Draw it</strong> as if it were <strong>boxed</strong>. Don't put in detail, even if you love detail. <strong>Go for the form</strong>.</li>

<li>Now, <strong>draw it again in another position</strong>. You have to <strong>invent</strong> when you can't see the object in that position.</li>

</ol>

<p>You can draw from real-life objects, other drawings, or photos, that's fine. No cheating that way. Anything really. Drawing something simple in imaginary positions prepares you to do this with <strong>anything drawable</strong>.</p>

<p>When you advance, you will use <strong>multiple forms</strong>: blocks, wedges, cylinders, tori, spheres.</p>

<h2>Forms Beyond Boxes: Spheres and the Blob Approach</h2>

<h3>Using Spheres</h3>

<p>Let's look at <strong>spheres</strong> for a moment. Spheres as forms:</p>

<ul>

<li>This is a circle in circles.</li>

<li>And a sphere in circles.</li>

<li>So is this, sort of.</li>

<li>This is a sphere in a sphere.</li>

<li>So is this, sort of.</li>

</ul>

<p>Spheres are such simple forms and so appealing, you may be tempted to start with them. And some people do. Andrew Loomis taught cartoonists to invent heads by reducing them to simplified spheres. But two things to know in advance about spheres:</p>

<ol>

<li>Placing <strong>ellipses on spheres precisely is very advanced</strong>, more difficult than you may think. But the good news is, placing them not so precisely is easy.</li>

<li>Accurate ellipses on spheres come from knowing accurate lines on <strong>boxes</strong>.</li>

</ol>

<h3>The Blob Approach</h3>

<p>I will introduce you to a freehand way to begin a form drawing that I call <strong>the Blob Approach</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>The Blob Approach?</strong></p>

<p>Yes, the Blob Approach - a very simplified method of drawing a form from a shape with a cross-contour line or two or three. That gets us started. Then we can work as much as we like on refining it.</p>

<h2>Preparing for Advanced Topics</h2>

<p>This is a challenging human activity exclusive to mammals with prefrontal cortexes. Figure it out if you can. I'm here to help, but before you watch me draw this, I recommend that you <strong>try it yourself</strong>. That preps you for it.</p>

<p>It may look logical when you see it demoed, and it is logical, but if you haven't studied the logic, you'll find it more difficult than you expect.</p>

<p>If, however, you have learned the forms, try your redrawings in several varied positions. It may inspire others and display your skill. If you draw something worth sharing in our community, it shall be seen. If it's something worth showcasing, you shall be celebrated.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p>First, <strong>simplify</strong>. Understand it as <strong>form</strong>. Then draw another position, that is not copying, that is <strong>creating</strong>. This is your challenge. It takes some thought, and it is the test to see if you need it or not.</p>

<p>Now, to reiterate:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Choose what you'll draw</strong>. I recommend something boxy.</li>

<li><strong>Start with a blob</strong> to decide your direction.</li>

<li>Using that blob as a base, <strong>sculpt out a simplified version</strong>.</li>

<li>Then <strong>draw that blob in a different position</strong>.</li>

<li><strong>Repeat</strong>. Do that at least three times, daring with different positions.</li>

</ul>

<p>In our next lessons, we'll study the science of how all this form business works: <strong>orthos</strong>, <strong>axes</strong>, <strong>eye levels</strong>, <strong>picture planes</strong>, and much more.</p>
