<h2>What's in Premium?</h2>

<p>In this lesson, we explore the process of painting <strong>color keys</strong> for film production. You'll learn what color keys are and how they help plan the <strong>mood</strong>, <strong>time of day</strong>, and lighting details in key shots. We discuss the importance of lighting in storytelling and how to gather effective references. Through a practical demonstration, we create color keys for different lighting scenarios—nighttime, daytime, and foggy environments—using a simple story sequence. This lesson provides insights into planning and executing lighting to enhance the emotion and narrative of a scene.</p>
