<h2>Extending Your Approach</h2>

<p>When working on poses that fall outside the standard <strong>weight-on-one-leg</strong> stance, it's important to see how <strong>malleable</strong> your gesture drawing approach can be. Instead of relying on familiar proportions, focus on interpreting what you see through <strong>lines and rhythms</strong>, even when dealing with <strong>foreshortening</strong>.</p>

<h2>Maintaining the Big Idea</h2>

<p>Keep gesture drawing <strong>notational</strong> to stay in touch with your <strong>idea</strong> and ensure it's working at this stage. Avoid adding shapes, overlaps, or perspective too early. Remember, gesture is about capturing the <strong>essence</strong> of the pose, the <strong>story</strong> it tells.</p>

<h2>Dealing with Foreshortening</h2>

<p>Foreshortening presents challenges, especially when limited to line and rhythm. Here are some tips:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Adjust Lengths</strong>: Shorten lines to represent limbs coming toward you.</li>

<li><strong>Use Wrapping Lines</strong>: Increase the degree of wrapping to indicate perspective.</li>

<li><strong>Control Exposure</strong>: Understand that foreshortening is about the controlled exposure of a limb's length.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Flipping the Sequence for Bent Poses</h2>

<p>For poses where the figure is bending forward or backward, flip your usual sequence:</p>

<ul>

<li>Start with the <strong>cervical spine</strong>.</li>

<li>Follow with the <strong>thoracic</strong>, <strong>lumbar</strong>, and <strong>pelvis</strong> lines.</li>

<li>This captures the <strong>pinch</strong> and <strong>stretch</strong> in the torso effectively.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Incorporating Observational Measurements</h2>

<p>When standard proportions don't apply, supplement your approach with <strong>observational measurements</strong>:</p>

<ul>

<li>Use <strong>plumb lines</strong> to relate different parts of the body.</li>

<li>Compare lengths of limbs to maintain <strong>proportion</strong>.</li>

<li>Recognize that the figure's design allows it to fold naturally, like an <strong>Ikea</strong> product.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Handling Seated and Crouched Poses</h2>

<p>In seated or crouched poses:</p>

<ul>

<li>Focus on the <strong>overall balance</strong> and <strong>weight distribution</strong>.</li>

<li>Capture the <strong>asymmetry</strong> of the figure to create dynamic poses.</li>

<li>Remember that the <strong>footprint</strong> is also asymmetrical and can add interest.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Avoiding Tangents and Overlaps</h2>

<p>To prevent confusion in complex poses:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Adjust limb positions</strong> to avoid tangents.</li>

<li>Use <strong>line weight</strong> to differentiate foreground elements from the background.</li>

<li>Be mindful of areas where limbs might overlap.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Embracing Subtlety</h2>

<p>Subtle poses can be the hardest to capture:</p>

<ul>

<li>Pay attention to <strong>minor shifts</strong> in alignment.</li>

<li>Use <strong>line weight variations</strong> and <strong>wrapping lines</strong> to indicate slight foreshortening.</li>

<li>Understand that even in less dynamic poses, the <strong>gesture</strong> is vital.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Tips for Extreme Foreshortening</h2>

<p>For poses with significant foreshortening:</p>

<ul>

<li>Simplify the figure into <strong>basic shapes</strong>.</li>

<li><strong>Stack shapes</strong> to build the figure piece by piece.</li>

<li>Recognize that foreshortening reduces the <strong>visible length</strong> of limbs dramatically.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Staying Flexible in Your Technique</h2>

<p>Always be open to integrating different tools and approaches:</p>

<ul>

<li>Balance <strong>analytic</strong> and <strong>observational</strong> methods.</li>

<li>Adjust your techniques to suit the <strong>pose's demands</strong>.</li>

<li>Keep the <strong>division of labor</strong> in mind, focus on gesture now and refine later.</li>

</ul>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p>Adapting gesture drawing to complex poses is about flexibility and understanding. By focusing on lines, rhythms, and the big idea, you can capture any pose, no matter how challenging. Remember, the goal is to keep in touch with your <strong>idea</strong> and ensure it's working, even in the most intricate positions.</p>
