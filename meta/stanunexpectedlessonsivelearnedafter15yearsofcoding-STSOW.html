<h2>Fix the System When Mistakes Keep Happening</h2>

<p>If my team keeps making the same mistakes, it's time to fix the system causing them. In my iOS development days, we had crashes due to UI updates off the main thread. Instead of accepting this, I updated the subscription layer to always call subscribers on the main thread, eliminating these crashes.</p>

<p><strong>Takeaway:</strong> Address the root cause of recurring issues in your system.</p>

<h2>Balance Quality and Speed Appropriately</h2>

<p>Assessing the trade-off between code quality and development speed is crucial. In some contexts, shipping bugs is acceptable if fixing them quickly adds more value. For example, in startups with limited resources, it's often better to deliver features rapidly and iterate based on feedback.</p>

<p><strong>Key Point:</strong> Adapt your approach to the context, sometimes speed outweighs perfection.</p>

<h2>Sharpen Your Tools for Efficiency</h2>

<p>Investing time in mastering your tools pays off immensely. Knowing editor shortcuts, command-line tools, and browser DevTools can save significant time. Early in my career, I spent a summer configuring my development environment, which greatly improved my productivity.</p>

<p><strong>Advice:</strong> Learn and optimize your tools to work faster and more effectively.</p>

<h2>Simplify Complexity You Can't Justify</h2>

<p>When I find a task difficult but can't explain why, it's often due to unnecessary complexity. Breaking down the problem or rethinking the approach can make it manageable. Simplifying systems not only eases implementation but also enhances maintainability.</p>

<p><strong>Tip:</strong> Challenge unjustified complexity and strive for simplicity.</p>

<h2>Solve Bugs at the Root Cause</h2>

<p>Instead of patching over bugs, I aim to fix the underlying issue. If a component crashes because a variable is null, I investigate why it's null. By addressing the root cause, I prevent the bug from occurring elsewhere and improve system stability.</p>

<p><strong>Lesson:</strong> Dig deeper to fix the source of bugs, not just the symptoms.</p>

<h2>Use Version History to Find Bugs</h2>

<p>When faced with perplexing bugs, reviewing commit history can provide insights. In one case, a memory leak was traced back to a recent change after examining the logs. Tools like <code>git bisect</code> help identify problematic commits by isolating changes that introduced bugs.</p>

<p><strong>Strategy:</strong> Utilize version control history to track down elusive bugs.</p>

<h2>Avoid Over-Engineering</h2>

<p>It's easy to get caught up in writing perfect code with exhaustive tests, but this can hinder progress. I've learned to balance code quality with efficiency by focusing on what's necessary. Sometimes, shipping a feature quickly with minimal testing is more valuable than delaying for perfection.</p>

<p><strong>Reality Check:</strong> Don't over-engineer, prioritize what's essential to deliver value promptly.</p>

<h2>Make Debugging Easier Proactively</h2>

<p>Implementing strategies to simplify debugging saves time and reduces frustration. I use techniques like detailed logging, scripts to replicate issues, and environments that mirror production. By making it easier to diagnose problems, I fix bugs more efficiently.</p>

<p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Invest in tools and processes that streamline debugging.</p>

<h2>Don't Hesitate to Ask Questions</h2>

<p>Early in my career, I hesitated to ask questions for fear of seeming inexperienced. I've learned that asking questions accelerates learning and prevents wasted time. Colleagues are often willing to help, and their insights can clarify confusion quickly.</p>

<p><strong>Encouragement:</strong> Asking questions is a strength. Don't let fear hold you back.</p>

<h2>Focus on Shipping Quickly and Often</h2>

<p>Shipping features regularly is vital. To achieve this, I optimize processes, simplify codebases, and remove bottlenecks. I prioritize easy deploys, minimize dependencies, and establish reusable patterns. Maintaining momentum is crucial for success.</p>

<p><strong>Goal:</strong> Optimize for speed and efficiency to keep development moving.</p>

<h2>Deploy Early and Iterate</h2>

<p>Deploying early versions helps identify issues sooner and provides real user feedback. By getting a working version into production quickly, I can iterate based on actual usage rather than assumptions.</p>

<p><strong>Advice:</strong> Don't wait for perfection before deploying. Use early deployments to guide development.</p>

<h2>Learn Version Control Early On</h2>

<p>Understanding version control systems like Git is essential. Learning Git gave me confidence to experiment, knowing I could always revert changes. It also facilitated collaboration and improved project organization.</p>

<p><strong>Tip:</strong> Master version control to enhance workflow and collaboration.</p>

<h2>Keep It Simple - Simplicity Scales</h2>

<p>Simple solutions often scale better than complex ones. Overcomplicating architectures introduces unnecessary difficulties as a project grows. By aiming for simplicity, I create systems that are easier to maintain and extend.</p>

<p><strong>Insight:</strong> Choose simplicity over complexity to facilitate scalability.</p>

<h2>Learn from the Market and Feedback</h2>

<p>Understanding my true skill level required comparing myself to industry standards. Interviewing at other companies helped me gauge my abilities. Giving interviews and engaging with the developer community provided valuable perspectives.</p>

<p><strong>Suggestion:</strong> Regularly assess your skills through market feedback and embrace continuous learning opportunities.</p>
