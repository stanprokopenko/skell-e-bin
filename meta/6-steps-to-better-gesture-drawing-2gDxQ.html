<h2>This Week's Assignment</h2>

<p>For your homework this week, you'll be doing a series of <strong>gesture drawings</strong>. Use the <strong>six steps</strong> to break the body down into asymmetries, focusing on keeping within that <strong>16 to 17 line</strong> ballpark.</p>

<p>I'd like you to:</p>

<ul>

<li>Do <strong>10 gesture drawings from master copies</strong>.</li>

<li>Do <strong>10 gesture drawings from your imagination</strong>.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Master Copies</h3>

<p>When I say "master copies," I mean drawings from <strong>any artists or sources that you like</strong>. Masters are not limited to classical artists like Michelangelo or Rubens. They can be from comics, video games, movies, or anything that inspires you.</p>

<p>On my demo sheet, I include:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Michelangelo</strong></li>

<li><strong>Rubens</strong></li>

<li><strong>Rodin</strong></li>

<li><strong>Rob Liefeld</strong> (Yes, some people despise him, but I love his work.)</li>

<li><strong>Abby from The Last of Us</strong> (Her body language communicates different emotions throughout the game.)</li>

<li><strong>Kratos from God of War</strong> (The evolution of his pose and body type tells an interesting story.)</li>

</ul>

<p>I believe that <strong>3D character artists</strong> have just as much understanding of gesture, body language, movement, and dynamics as 2D concept artists. So, feel free to draw from 3D models, concept art, or any visual media where these principles are evident.</p>

<p>For other teachers, it might be unconventional to mix these sources, but I encourage you to use <strong>anything you like</strong>. The key is that the principles of gesture and asymmetry are present.</p>

<h3>Drawing from Your Imagination</h3>

<p>For the last part of the assignment, try <strong>10 gesture drawings from your imagination</strong>. I know this is more challenging, especially with a new technique, but drawing from your head helps you:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Disconnect</strong> from needing to represent something specific.</li>

<li><strong>Quickly learn</strong> what you don't understand.</li>

<li><strong>Identify areas</strong> where you need more focus.</li>

</ul>

<p>This exercise will help you come back to your work with fresh eyes and a better understanding of where to improve.</p>

<p>Good luck with your homework this week!</p>
