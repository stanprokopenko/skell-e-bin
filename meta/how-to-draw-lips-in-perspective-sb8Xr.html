<h2>Importance of the Denture Sphere</h2>

<p>When drawing lips, it's crucial to integrate them with the <strong>denture sphere</strong>. This helps maintain the underlying structure of the face. Avoid overly simple or stylized lips, as this can undermine the hard work put into the denture sphere. Remember, lips have <strong>height and depth</strong>, similar to the eyes, and should be depicted as such.</p>

<h2>Anatomy and Structure of the Lips</h2>

<p>Lips sit on top of the denture sphere and consist of <strong>muscle, skin, and fat</strong>. They have three distinct surfaces:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Outside</strong>: Coarser with more keratin.</li>

<li><strong>Vermilion Border</strong>: Warmer and redder.</li>

<li><strong>Mucosa</strong>: The part that moves across the teeth.</li>

</ul>

<p>To avoid flatness, design lips with at least <strong>two planes</strong>.</p>

<h2>Design Principles Using "M" and "W" Shapes</h2>

<p>Think of the upper lip as an <strong>"M" shape</strong> and the lower lip as a <strong>"W" shape</strong>. These shapes can be exaggerated, thin, stretched, or simple based on the individual. Lips attach to a node, designed like a <strong>chubby triangle</strong>, with muscles pulling in different directions to create expressions.</p>

<h2>Step-by-Step Drawing Process</h2>

<ol>

<li><strong>Establish a Midline</strong>: Start with a wrapping center to maintain perspective.</li>

<li><strong>Break the Upper Lip into Three Shapes</strong>: A central triangle and two side triangles resembling door wedges.</li>

<li><strong>Use "M" and "W" Shapes</strong>: These shapes act as gestures for drawing lips and help study different types of lips quickly.</li>

<li><strong>Visualize Lips as Graphic or Flat Shapes</strong>: This helps understand their structure.</li>

<li><strong>Three-Step Process</strong>:<ul>

<li>Wrapping line</li>

<li>"M" and "W" shapes</li>

<li>Perspective</li>

</ul>

</li>

</ol>

<h2>Consideration of Surrounding Facial Fat</h2>

<p><strong>Buccal fat</strong> and <strong>jowl fat</strong> significantly impact the appearance of the lips and surrounding facial features. Buccal fat can conceal or reveal features, while jowl fat, which reacts to a lifetime of speech, often becomes more prominent with age.</p>

<h3>Examples:</h3>

<ul>

<li><strong>Amy Winehouse</strong>: Fuller face due to buccal fat.</li>

<li><strong>Ed Harris</strong>: Lack of buccal fat.</li>

<li><strong>Vince Vaughn</strong>: Noticeable piece of fat at the top corner of the mouth.</li>

<li><strong>Judi Dench</strong>: Jowl fat dropping below the mandible.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Lighting and Shading Techniques</h2>

<p><strong>Plane changes</strong> are crucial for lighting. Top lighting usually casts shadows on the upper lip and highlights the fullness of the lower lip. Use highlights and differences in light and shadow to guide your drawing. Consider the planes in total: <strong>forward, back, forward, back</strong>. Recognize the presence or absence of lips by considering buccal fat.</p>

<p>Develop features with a broader awareness of <strong>anatomy and fat</strong>. Build form and think about features on the head in a <strong>three-dimensional way</strong>. This approach will help you create more realistic and lifelike drawings of lips.</p>
