<h2>Discovering My Passion for Coloring</h2>

<p>I started out aiming to be a penciler, like many artists. I showed portfolios with pencils, inks, and colors, but the feedback was clear: everyone loved my colors. It took me a couple of years to realize that coloring was my strength. So, I sent color samples to Jim Lee's studio, focusing on what I did best. Two weeks later, Jim called and invited me to join the studio. <strong>Over 32 years later, I'm still coloring</strong>, and I've found my true passion in enhancing comics through color.</p>

<h2>The Importance of Artistic Foundations</h2>

<p>Having a <strong>strong artistic base</strong> is essential. Even as a colorist, you need to understand penciling and inking. The concepts translate across all disciplines. You don't have to be the best penciler, but that knowledge helps in coloring. It's about using those skills differently to enhance the artwork and contribute meaningfully to the collaboration.</p>

<h2>Collaboration and Storytelling</h2>

<p>Comics are a <strong>collaborative effort</strong>. As a colorist, I work after one or two artists. It's important to respect what was done before, but also bring my own flair. I aim to add mood, drama, and enhance the storytelling. Reading the script is vital, it helps establish time of day, location, and any specific color notes the writer may have. <strong>Every decision I make, from palette choices to making characters pop, is influenced by the script and the art</strong>.</p>

<h2>Advice for Aspiring Colorists</h2>

<p>Focus on <strong>coloring interiors</strong>, not just covers. The main job is telling the story through interior pages. Download inks and color five-page sequences to show you can add mood, drama, and support the art. It's more about storytelling than producing a single striking image. Demonstrating your ability to enhance the narrative is key.</p>

<h2>Embracing Technology</h2>

<p>Technology is always evolving, and it's crucial to keep up. Programs like Photoshop, Clip Studio, and Procreate offer different tools for artists. <strong>The iPad and Procreate have changed the game</strong>, allowing me to color anywhere. I often use both Procreate and Photoshop together. Staying ahead means embracing new tools and continuously improving.</p>

<h2>Efficiency and Workflow</h2>

<p>An efficient workspace boosts speed and productivity. <strong>Learning shortcuts and hotkeys</strong> in software saves valuable time. I use Wacom products like the EK Remote, programming keystrokes to minimize unnecessary movements. In an industry where you're paid per page, efficiency is key. Building muscle memory and streamlining processes help me produce more pages without sacrificing quality.</p>

<h2>Staying Ahead in the Industry</h2>

<p>I typically color about three books a month, plus covers, totaling around four books. To stay relevant, I constantly improve and adapt. New artists are always emerging, so <strong>evolving and enhancing my skills is part of the job</strong>. Embracing change and striving for excellence keep me at the top of my game.</p>
