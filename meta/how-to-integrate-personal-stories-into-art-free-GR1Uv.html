<h2>What's in Premium?</h2>

<p>Hi everyone! I'm Bryce Ko, a concept artist and illustrator known for my work on <strong>"Sea of Stars."</strong> In the premium lesson, I'll walk you through my <strong>illustration process</strong> for two pieces: a personal cat character and a <strong>"Spirited Away"</strong> fan art.</p>

<p>You'll see how I start with <strong>research</strong>, studying real-life references to understand form and structure. I'll share my techniques for creating <strong>sketches and line art</strong>, refining initial ideas into detailed compositions. We'll explore how to apply <strong>flats</strong>, keeping color palettes simple and cohesive, and how to add <strong>shadows and highlights</strong> to bring depth to your work.</p>

<p>For the fan art, I'll demonstrate how to capture an existing style, plan effective <strong>thumbnails</strong>, and incorporate elements that resonate with fans. We'll dive into achieving the right mood through <strong>lighting and shading</strong>, and how to unify a piece by adjusting values and colors.</p>
