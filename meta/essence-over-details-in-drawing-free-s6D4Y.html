<h2>What's in Premium?</h2>

<p>In the premium lesson, you'll learn the "yearbook principle" in art, which focuses on capturing the essence of a subject, especially in drawing faces. This principle helps you recognize people by their overall head shape and silhouette, rather than minute details. Techniques like using black and white photos and squinting are taught to simplify visual information and focus on essential shapes. You'll also learn the importance of accurate placement of darks to capture a subject's essence, with details being secondary. This lesson emphasizes capturing the core essence for a solid feel in artwork.</p>
