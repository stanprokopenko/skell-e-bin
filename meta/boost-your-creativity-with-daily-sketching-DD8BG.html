<p>I'm Len Nicholas, also known as <strong>Toyogogo</strong> on Instagram and social media. I'm a freelance concept artist and industrial designer. After working for clients during the day, I like to unwind on my couch at night and draw whatever comes to mind in my sketchbook. In this article, I'll share some of my sketches, my thought process, and my approach to art.</p>

<h2>My Nightly Sketchbook Routine</h2>

<p>Every night, I try to complete a sketch in my sketchbook. It's a time for me to experiment, have fun, and draw whatever I feel like. Sometimes I play with ideas I encountered during the day or explore characters I've created.</p>

<h2>Berserker Otter and Other Characters</h2>

<p>I have a series of characters that I love to draw, like <strong>Berserker Otter</strong>, an otter with ADD and a big sword. The possibilities are endless with him. I enjoy exploring these ridiculous animals and seeing where the concepts take me.</p>

<h2>Robots and Mechanisms</h2>

<p>I have an industrial design background, so I love drawing robots and mechanisms. I enjoy incorporating aesthetic features from things I like, such as adding elements from the Millennium Falcon into mechs. Robots with television faces are another favorite of mine. Growing up without a TV, I've always been obsessed with them, and it informs my aesthetic.</p>

<h3>Incorporating Aesthetic Features</h3>

<p>I often take inspiration from pop culture and incorporate it into my art. For example, I did a demo where I integrated features from the Millennium Falcon into a robot design. It's fun to see how different elements can blend into something new.</p>

<h2>Armed Animals</h2>

<p>I like taking animals that are perhaps defenseless and arming them to the gills. Just because they're cute and cuddly doesn't mean they can't protect themselves. For example, I've drawn ducks driving tanks over fields of skulls. <strong>Looks can be deceiving!</strong></p>

<h3>Ducks Driving Tanks</h3>

<p>I have a series where I explore the concept of ducks in military scenarios. One sketch shows a duck in a sophisticated mech suit about to be taken out by a cardboard box trap, a nod to their inherent cluelessness.</p>

<h3>Tortoise Grenade Concept</h3>

<p>I was fascinated by the aesthetic of tortoises and grenades, so I created a tortoise that's also a grenade. He can pull his pin and run toward you, serving as a walking bomb. He might only make it a few feet, but the idea amuses me.</p>

<h2>Experimenting with Gouache</h2>

<p>While I don't always have time for gouache in my nightly sketches, I enjoy incorporating it when I can. Gouache adds a different dimension to my sketches, and I'm having a lot of fun with it.</p>

<h2>Pop Culture Influences</h2>

<p>I often draw inspiration from things I love, like <strong>"The Legend of Zelda," "Hollow Knight,"</strong> and various video games. I'm not above fan art, sometimes I just want to draw things I enjoy.</p>

<h3>Zelda and "Tears of the Kingdom"</h3>

<p>I'm a big fan of Zelda games, and sometimes I draw scenes or characters inspired by them. My daughter is obsessed with Zelda, so it definitely influences my work.</p>

<h3>"Hollow Knight" and Other Games</h3>

<p>I love "Hollow Knight," and I've drawn sketches inspired by its characters. Incorporating elements from games I enjoy keeps my art fresh and exciting.</p>

<h3>Sharing Interests with Family</h3>

<p>My 13-year-old daughter recently got into cyberpunk, and I'm thrilled. I feel like I'm killing it as a dad right now! It's great to share interests and have them influence my work.</p>

<h2>Transforming the Sedentary into the Mobile</h2>

<p>I enjoy taking things that are inherently stationary, like rocks and trees, and turning them into mobile entities. For example, I've drawn bonsai trees in mechs or created mecha stones inspired by the "sword in the stone" concept. It's all about re-imagining the ordinary in extraordinary ways.</p>

<h2>Technology and Nature</h2>

<p>I'm fascinated by the overuse of technology and how it might relate to nature going forward. As a huge cyberpunk fan, I enjoy exploring the intersection of technology and organic life. For instance, I've drawn cats with mech companions or bugs integrated with fusion reactors.</p>

<h2>The Pokémon War Concept</h2>

<p>In the first Pokémon game, there's a line where someone says, "Oh, that's a Pikachu. One of those saved me during the war." That got me thinking: <strong>What does war look like in the world of Pokémon?</strong> Children can catch Pokémon that are essentially extinction-level threats. If a child has a Pokémon akin to a nuclear warhead, how does that impact warfare?</p>

<p>I started drawing Vietnam-era Pokémon, exploring the idea of <strong>militarized Pokémon</strong>. I have so many questions about this world and its implications. It's a fascinating rabbit hole to go down.</p>

<h2>The Trix Rabbit Wars</h2>

<p>I like asking "what if" questions in my art. For example, I considered the long-running Trix cereal slogan <strong>"Trix are for kids"</strong> and thought about how the rabbit might react. Decades of being denied could lead to the rabbits snapping. I drew a series depicting rabbits in mechs, escalating conflicts, and even dropping bombs. The message is simple: <strong>For goodness' sake, just give the rabbits the cereal!</strong></p>

<h2>Importance of Fun and Failure in Art</h2>

<p>Art should be about fun and relationships. In concept art, there's a lot of emphasis on productivity and technical skill, but it's crucial to have fun with it. <strong>Experimenting and allowing yourself to fail is essential.</strong> If you're not failing at least once a week, you're not pushing yourself.</p>

<h2>Asking "Why" and "What If" in Art</h2>

<p>What I love about art and design is the questions you can ask. <strong>Asking "why" and "what if" opens up endless possibilities.</strong> It allows you to re-contextualize ideas and create something new and exciting. On the page, there are no limits to what you can do or attempt.</p>

<h2>The Role of Line Weight in Art</h2>

<p>I've sold out to line, I am addicted to <strong>line weight</strong>. Line weight is critical in describing forms and adding depth to drawings, especially in tech and industrial design.</p>

<h3>Three Levels of Line Weight</h3>

<p>I teach line weight in my classes, focusing on a three-weight system:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Contour Line</strong>: The darkest line that describes the silhouette of an object.</li>

<li><strong>Parting Line</strong>: The second thickest line that indicates where assemblies come together.</li>

<li><strong>Detail Line</strong>: The thinnest line used for internal details.</li>

</ul>

<p>Having a hierarchy in your line weight helps make your drawings more readable and appealing. I'm actually working on a course specifically on line weight because it's so neglected and important.</p>

<h2>Sketching Anywhere</h2>

<p>I carry my sketchbook everywhere and draw whenever I can, even in places like church or the symphony. Inspired by <strong>James Gurney</strong>, I started bringing my sketchbook to the symphony, and eventually to church. It's about seizing every opportunity to draw.</p>

<h2>Daily Artistic Routine and Health</h2>

<p>My daily routine starts with a walk every morning. <strong>Health is essential for an artist</strong>. Your brain needs rest, care, and nutrients. I do some journaling to prepare my mind for the day. After working for my clients, I spend time with my family, and then sketch for an hour or two before bed.</p>

<h2>Prepping Your Environment for Creativity</h2>

<p>I believe in preparing my environment to encourage creativity. I have a <strong>"bug-out bag"</strong> full of art supplies, so I can draw anytime without any friction. Having everything ready ensures that when inspiration strikes, I'm prepared.</p>

<h2>Tech Drawing Tips</h2>

<h3>Starting with Big Shapes</h3>

<p><strong>Economy informs my work</strong> a lot. I start with the big shapes and forms before adding details. It's essential to establish the overall structure before refining. You can't "sand a turd," no amount of detail can fix a bad concept.</p>

<h2>Instagram Tips for Artists</h2>

<p>If you're trying to build your Instagram, certain subjects are <strong>Instagram gold</strong>:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Mushrooms</strong>: People love mushroom drawings.</li>

<li><strong>Hello Kitty</strong>: Hello Kitty art gets lots of likes.</li>

<li><strong>BMO from "Adventure Time"</strong>: Always popular.</li>

<li><strong>Invader Zim</strong>: Another fan favorite.</li>

</ul>

<p>Sometimes you have to pander a little, but it can help grow your following.</p>

<h2>Sketching People and Celebrities</h2>

<p>Sometimes when I meet a celebrity, I like to draw a cyborg version of them and get a picture with them if they're cool with it. It's a fun way to connect. For example, I met <strong>Kim Coates</strong>, an amazing actor, and he was happy with the cyborg sketch I did of him.</p>

<p>I also drew a mecha version of <strong>Marshall</strong> from Proko. I imagined him getting ready for work, being lowered onto a magnificent chassis and loaded up for the day.</p>

<h2>Playing with Wordplay and Concepts</h2>

<p>I enjoy playing with phrases and concepts. For example, I came across the saying <strong>"You can't hug children with nuclear arms."</strong> I disagreed, thinking that with nuclear arms as a powerful energy source, you could hug many children. It's about taking phrases literally and exploring them visually.</p>

<h2>The Future of Technology</h2>

<p>Working in the toy field, I see animatronic toys becoming more sophisticated. Eventually, these toys will end up in landfills, creating an eerie landscape of mechanical carcasses. It's fascinating, and a bit terrifying, to think about how overuse of technology might impact nature and our environment.</p>

<h2>Thoughts on AI Art</h2>

<p>For me, <strong>art is about relationships</strong> and personal expression. I feel that AI art removes the relational aspect of art. While I acknowledge the power of AI as a tool, I prefer to maintain my agency as an artist and create work that is uniquely human. I don't think a computer can do any human being justice.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p>My nightly sketchbook is a space where I can explore ideas, have fun, and push myself creatively. Whether I'm drawing robots, armed animals, or fan art, it's all about enjoying the process and connecting with others through my art. <strong>Remember to have fun with your art, allow yourself to fail, and keep drawing!</strong></p>
