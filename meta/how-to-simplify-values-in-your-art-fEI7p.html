<h2>Simplifying to Two or Three Values</h2>

<p>Your first project is to see <strong>value relationships</strong> and organize them into groups by simplifying images down to <strong>two or three values</strong>.</p>

<h2>Two-Value (Notan) Drawings</h2>

<p><strong>Two-value drawings</strong> (Notan) use just <strong>lights and darks</strong>. You'll choose a threshold: anything lighter goes into lights, anything darker into darks. This threshold is up to you, based on your perception.</p>

<h2>Three-Value Drawings</h2>

<p>With <strong>three values</strong>, you have <strong>lights</strong>, <strong>mid-values</strong>, and <strong>darks</strong>. The mid-value holds ambiguous values. While adding a mid-value gives more information, avoid overusing it. Make clear distinctions, setting two thresholds between light, mid, and dark.</p>

<h2>Assignment Level 1: Master Painting Thumbnails</h2>

<p>Your assignment is to do <strong>thumbnail studies</strong> of <strong>master paintings</strong>, focusing on values. Study how masters organize major value groups. Use provided images or choose your own favorites.</p>

<h3>Tips for Thumbnail Studies</h3>

<p><strong>Thumbnails</strong> are small drawings, one to six inches, forcing you to avoid details and focus on <strong>major shapes</strong>. Concentrate on massing shapes and simplifying values.</p>

<p><strong>Charles Bargue</strong> provides excellent inspiration. In his work, he simplifies images into two values, removing details and focusing on essential forms.</p>

<h2>Assignment Level 2: Still Life Thumbnails from Photos</h2>

<p>For more challenge, set up your own <strong>still life</strong>, compose, light, and photograph it. Then, do value studies from your photo. This is harder since you're working from a photo, not a master painting.</p>

<h3>Challenges of Working from Photos</h3>

<p><strong>Master paintings</strong> have had much problem-solving done. Photos present raw details and noise. You'll need to <strong>filter out</strong> unnecessary information, focusing on big masses. <strong>Fight the urge</strong> to include all details.</p>

<h2>Focus on Skills, Not Final Drawings</h2>

<p>Remember, the assignment isn't about beautiful drawings. It's about improving specific skills to help in future artworks.</p>
