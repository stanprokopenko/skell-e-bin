<h2>Understanding Figure Proportions</h2>

<p>It's really important that you get a basic understanding of the <strong>proportions of the figure</strong> that you're going to be positioning and moving around.</p>

<h2>Developing the Proportion Chart</h2>

<h3>Setting Up the Scale</h3>

<p>Try to go through the same development of the proportion chart that I did. Start by drawing a line for the <strong>head</strong> at the top and a line for the <strong>foot</strong> at the bottom. This establishes your idea about <strong>scale</strong>. Then, between these two lines, divide the total height into <strong>halves</strong>.</p>

<h3>Dividing into Halves and Thirds</h3>

<p>I started by marking the first division and then added three more above and three more below. That gives you your <strong>eight-head figure</strong>. From there, you have the heads down to the <strong>pelvis</strong>, which is at <strong>head four</strong>, and then the divisions for the bottom.</p>

<p>You can then come in between <strong>head one and two</strong> and <strong>head two and three</strong> and make divisions into <strong>thirds</strong>. This will help you place the <strong>rib cage</strong> a little more clearly there. I did the thirds in blue and the initial halves in a warmer red. Hopefully, you can see that difference if you want to go back and try to copy.</p>

<h2>Placing the Major Masses</h2>

<p>Put the big masses, your <strong>head</strong>, <strong>rib cage</strong>, and <strong>pelvis</strong>, layered in so that you can understand the way the <strong>spine</strong> pushes them and organizes that chaotic tower that is our body.</p>

<h2>Completing the Lay-In with Limbs</h2>

<p>Complete that with a simple lay-in of the directional angles or curves of the <strong>legs</strong>.</p>
