<h2>What's in Premium?</h2>

<p>In this premium lesson, we focus on <strong>Visual Memory Games Level Two: Mannequinized Figure Drawing</strong>. You'll learn three exercises designed to improve your visual memory and ability to draw figures from imagination:</p>

<ol>

<li>

<p><strong>Drawing from Memory</strong>: Observe a pose, put the reference away, and draw it from memory. You'll learn how to analyze gestures, rhythms, proportions, and alignments to capture the figure accurately.</p>

</li>

<li>

<p><strong>Drawing from a Different Angle</strong>: Draw the pose from the same angle, then, without the reference, draw it again from a different viewpoint. This exercise enhances your understanding of three-dimensional forms and spatial relationships.</p>

</li>

<li>

<p><strong>Changing Angle and Proportions</strong>: Study a pose and draw it from a new angle with altered proportions. This challenges you to adapt and design figures while maintaining coherence.</p>

</li>

</ol>

<p>By practicing these exercises, you'll enhance your ability to visualize and construct figures, improve your understanding of forms, and build confidence in drawing from imagination.</p>
