<p>Hi guys, I'm Cesar Santos. I'm here with Stan Prokopenko in his studio. He invited me to talk about how I approach <strong>values</strong> in portrait drawing. For this demonstration, I'm using a portrait of Stan himself.</p>

<h2>Simplifying the Drawing</h2>

<p>To begin, I traced a photo of Stan in a very simplified way. I was looking for <strong>high points and low points</strong>. For example, at the back of the head, there's a big vertical downward action. I looked for the <strong>outermost point</strong>, which I saw was the ear. There's also a turnaround where the big mass of the head is, and then it tapers inside. I marked the highest point on the top and connected these points with straight lines.</p>

<p>This simplification helps in transferring essential information. Now that we have the <strong>simple shapes</strong>, we're ready to move on to values.</p>

<h2>Establishing the Shadow Areas</h2>

<p>I've compressed and unified the <strong>shadow areas</strong> into one simple dark value. Think about this like the famous photograph of Che Guevara, where we get his character from just two values. We don't need to jump into shading or advanced stuff without first knowing that we can get a lot of information from <strong>two values</strong>.</p>

<h2>Tools for Smoothing Values</h2>

<p>To smooth out the values, I use several tools:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Pan Pastel</strong>: It's like a palette knife with a sponge tip. It helps me smooth and make sure the grains from the pastel go into the paper.</li>

<li><strong>Synthetic Brush</strong>: I've cut the hairs so they become more stiff. I press it into the paper, creating a darker value than the sponge.</li>

</ul>

<p>These tools help me achieve a <strong>flat value</strong> all around the shadows. I want to unify the shadows into one clean tone.</p>

<h2>Importance of Smooth Shadows</h2>

<p>We need a <strong>clean tone</strong>, because any variation will be more visible. The shadows should be very quiet and smooth. Think of the shadows as the <strong>bass in a band</strong>, they are in the background keeping the rhythm. The lights are like the violin that comes to the front of the stage.</p>

<h2>Building Up the Light Areas</h2>

<p>Now that we have the shadows unified, we can create the illusion of form. This initial stage may look flat and not very artistic, but it's fine because we'll develop it as we work.</p>

<p>I'm thinking of values in terms of the <strong>bigger mass</strong> first. The head is like a <strong>sphere</strong>, and the light is coming from the top. The light decreases as it goes down and towards the side. Even though he's facing the light, the edge here is darker than the middle because of the form.</p>

<p>I start to <strong>broom</strong> the halftones into the form in light. I'm keeping the <strong>sphere feeling</strong> to the face. The values are darker towards the shadow and get lighter as they get closer to the center where the light is hitting most directly.</p>

<h2>Be Wary of Optical Illusions</h2>

<p>Our eyes can be tricked by the surrounding tones. For example, an area might look lighter or darker depending on what's around it. We need to control our perception and not rely solely on what we think we see.</p>

<p>Scientists have measured the intensity of light in nature versus what the human eye can detect. Our eyes adjust to focus on a field of vision, setting the range of values. If we're not careful, we'll make everything in our drawing full of light and dark contrasts because we reacted to our natural deficiency in detecting that range.</p>

<p>This is why it's important to <strong>conceptualize the form</strong> and avoid getting tricked by optical illusions.</p>

<h2>Using the Eraser as a Drawing Tool</h2>

<p>The eraser isn't just for correcting errors, it's a great <strong>drawing tool</strong>. We can use it to pick out some of the lights, and fix up values. At this stage, it's better to keep things clean. You see me here picking up some of the lights, making sure I keep it very smooth.</p>

<h2>Modeling Smaller Forms</h2>

<p>Once we've established the big form, we can move on to the <strong>smaller forms</strong>. Now we think about features like the nose, eye sockets, and mouth area.</p>

<ul>

<li>The <strong>nose</strong> projects on top of the egg shape of the head. It reacts to light differently.</li>

<li>The <strong>eye sockets</strong> push inside the egg shape. The eye socket on the shadow side will be darker than the one on the light side.</li>

<li>The <strong>mouth area</strong> is like a half-orange projecting between the bottom of the nose and the chin. It's darker on the sides.</li>

</ul>

<p>Even now, I'm not focusing on details like wrinkles. I'm still planning big movements of tones and values.</p>

<h2>Adding the Darkest Values</h2>

<p>Now we need to decide on our <strong>darkest darks</strong>. The darkest note on this portrait is the shirt in shadow. I use a softer pencil, like a <strong>4B</strong>, to add these darks.</p>

<p>I also add darker values to the hair. The hair has a movement of tone, it gets darker towards the bottom as it casts shadows in between the strands. The mass of the hair catches the light on top, so it's lighter there.</p>

<h2>Going from Big to Small</h2>

<p>Throughout this process, I'm emphasizing the importance of going from <strong>big to small</strong>. I start with big form modeling, then move to smaller forms, and then to the darkest darks. This helps establish a good setup for adding more information later.</p>

<p>At this point, we have a simplified yet effective representation of the portrait's values. We've ignored other aspects like edges for now, focusing solely on values.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p>This is how I approach values in portrait drawing. By simplifying the shapes, unifying the shadows, and building up the lights and darks in an organized way, we can create a strong sense of form. Next time, we'll focus on edges, which are also crucial in describing the sense of three-dimensionality in a portrait.</p>

<p>Thank you guys, it's been a pleasure sharing this with you.</p>
