<h2>Kim Jung Gi's Drawing Technique</h2>

<p>We're going to take an aside to show you what grids do for those who imprint them. <strong>Kim Jung Gi</strong> could fill walls with drawings like this at high speed with nothing to look at. You may wonder, <strong>how did he do it?</strong></p>

<p>He tells us. In a live demo, his translator reported from Korean to English his explanation:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>All his drawing is just these boxes.</strong></li>

<li>After he understood the <strong>three-dimensional box</strong>, he started to improve a lot faster.</li>

<li>Even with the complicated images in his mind, this is pretty much what he's seeing.</li>

<li><strong>All these boxes are in his mind.</strong></li>

<li>So the entire scene is in boxes, and it's in his mind.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Visualizing Scenes with Boxes</h2>

<p>In his head, although he didn't draw it, the <strong>horizon line is already set</strong>. So that box becomes this guy, and this guy is the one in the front. And the big one will be something else. All the big images are set, and <strong>all the boxes are in his head</strong> so that he could draw them out.</p>

<p>Even if it's complicated, even the complicated images are broken down into these <strong>simple shapes in the huge box</strong>. Like I said, it's basically this big box, a single big box. It comes down to <strong>how much you understand the three-dimensional box and how well you can draw it</strong>. As long as one box is drawn on this big paper, he could pull out the entire scene.</p>

<h2>The Emphasis on Boxes</h2>

<p>He said more than this, but all this he said. Let's take a look at some key words: <strong>the box, the box, the box</strong>. Hmm, <strong>the cube, the cube, the cube</strong>. I'm seeing a theme here.</p>

<p>Don't be shackled by grids. Oh wait, no, that's not it. Look at how many times... Well, I don't need to repeat it. You can read it. Or you can watch him. That may be best. <strong>Kim Jung Gi passes the varied view test.</strong></p>

<h2>Observing from Multiple Perspectives</h2>

<p>One more thing he mentioned: To draw cats, dogs, airplanes, or your chosen subject, we do need to look at them <strong>objectively from more than one point of view</strong>. You've done that with <strong>orthos</strong>. Now use your orthos as reference.</p>

<h2>My Conversation with Kim Jung Gi</h2>

<p>I got to ask Kim Jung Gi about this emphasis on boxes six years before he died in 2022, with a mind toward you taking this course. Here it is:</p>

<p><strong>And does it need to be a cube, or can it be any box?</strong></p>

<p>He explained:</p>

<ul>

<li>I'm going to explain what I mean.</li>

<li>How it looks from here and how it looks from here.</li>

<li>At first, I could put only one object in the box, but now I can put <strong>all the space in the box</strong>.</li>

<li>To explain the box, 1, 2, 3, 2C comes out naturally, but apart from that, I just take a box, a box on the floor.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Advice for Perspective Students</h2>

<p>Any other advice that you would give perspective students?</p>

<p><strong>When you draw, you are aware of height, width, and depth in that imaginary space?</strong></p>

<ul>

<li>It's very important.</li>

<li>People need to have a relationship with the person in front of them and with the person next to them, so that they can create stories and events for each other.</li>

<li>As the space is created, a lot of things come into the picture.</li>

</ul>

<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>This is what I hope for.</p>

<p>Thank you very much, Kim Jung Gi.</p>

<p>That was Kim Jung Gi at Kazone Art Academy in 2016. I hope it encourages you to take on the demanding work ahead, to build skill, to <strong>draw that freely</strong>.</p>
