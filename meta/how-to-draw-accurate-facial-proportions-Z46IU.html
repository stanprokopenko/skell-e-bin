<h2>Constructing the Male Head</h2>

<p>When I start drawing a male head, I begin with a simple sphere to represent the cranium. Using the Loomis method, I divide the sphere horizontally to find the <strong>brow line</strong>. From the brow line, I measure down to the <strong>base of the nose</strong>, which aligns with the bottom of the sphere. This divides the face into thirds:</p>

<ol>

<li><strong>Top third</strong>: From the top of the head to the brow line.</li>

<li><strong>Middle third</strong>: From the brow line to the base of the nose.</li>

<li><strong>Bottom third</strong>: From the base of the nose to the bottom of the chin.</li>

</ol>

<h3>Placing the Facial Features</h3>

<ul>

<li><strong>Hairline</strong>: Located about one-third down from the top of the head to the brow line.</li>

<li><strong>Eyes</strong>: Found one-third down from the brow line to the base of the nose. The space between the eyes is approximately the width of one eye.</li>

<li><strong>Nose</strong>: The width aligns with the inner corners of the eyes.</li>

<li><strong>Mouth</strong>: The lip line is one-third down from the base of the nose to the chin. The corners of the mouth align vertically with the centers of the eyes.</li>

<li><strong>Ears</strong>: The top aligns with the brow line, and the bottom aligns with the base of the nose.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Drawing the Profile</h3>

<p>For the profile view, I use the same divisions. The <strong>forehead</strong> has two main planes, with the second plane angling back. The <strong>nose</strong> extends from the brow line, and you can often see a hint of the nostril from the side. The <strong>lips</strong> slope back from the bottom of the nose, with the <strong>upper lip</strong> slightly overlapping the lower lip. The <strong>chin</strong> connects back to the jawline, which angles up to the ear.</p>

<p>Remember, the <strong>neck</strong> isn't straight up and down, it curves forward, following the spine's natural curve. The <strong>sternocleidomastoid muscles</strong> attach behind the ear at the mastoid process, and connect down to the pit of the neck.</p>

<h2>Constructing the Female Head</h2>

<p>Drawing a female head follows the same basic principles but with softer features.</p>

<h3>Key Differences</h3>

<ul>

<li><strong>Jawline</strong>: Softer and more rounded than the male's.</li>

<li><strong>Chin</strong>: Less prominent and more delicate.</li>

<li><strong>Cheekbones</strong>: Higher and slightly wider.</li>

<li><strong>Neck</strong>: Thinner and more graceful.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Placing the Facial Features</h3>

<ul>

<li><strong>Hairline</strong>: Slightly lower and more rounded compared to the male's.</li>

<li><strong>Eyes</strong>: Same placement as the male, but with a softer shape and added eyelashes.</li>

<li><strong>Nose</strong>: Smaller and less pronounced.</li>

<li><strong>Mouth</strong>: Lips may be fuller, with a subtle Cupid's bow.</li>

<li><strong>Ears</strong>: Positioned the same but drawn with softer lines.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Drawing the Profile</h3>

<p>In the female profile, the <strong>forehead</strong> is more rounded. The <strong>nose</strong> is finer, and the <strong>lips</strong> are fuller, with a gentle slope to the chin. The <strong>neck</strong> flows smoothly from the head, lacking the prominent Adam's apple seen in males.</p>

<h2>Important Landmarks and Tips</h2>

<ul>

<li><strong>Keystone Shape (Glabella)</strong>: This area between the eyebrows helps in starting the nose and eyebrow placement.</li>

<li><strong>Temporal Line</strong>: Defines the side planes of the head and adds depth.</li>

<li><strong>Eye Asymmetry</strong>: The inner corner (tear duct) is usually lower than the outer corner.</li>

<li><strong>Space Between Eyes</strong>: About one eye-width.</li>

<li><strong>Alignment of Features</strong>: Vertical lines from the inner and outer eyes help place the nose and mouth accurately.</li>

<li><strong>Neck Alignment</strong>: In profile, the front of the neck aligns with the back of the jaw.</li>

</ul>

<p>By understanding these proportions and landmarks, you can construct accurate and expressive male and female heads. Practice observing real faces to see how these guidelines adapt to individual variations. Remember, these are general rules to guide you, but each face has unique features that make it special.</p>
