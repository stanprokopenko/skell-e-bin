<p>In this lesson, you'll learn two opposite ways of drawing: the <strong>blob approach</strong> and the <strong>grid approach</strong>. Both methods can lead to mastery, as seen in artists like Kim Jung Gi. Let's explore how they differ and how you can apply them to improve your drawing skills.</p>

<h2>The Blob Approach</h2>

<h3>Review of the Blob Method</h3>

<p>The blob approach is a way to get form fast by:</p>

<ul>

<li>Starting with something and deciding its position.</li>

<li>Wrapping a rubber band to point it away or toward.</li>

<li>Deciding on a corner that counter-angles the rubber band.</li>

<li>Snapping the curved rubber band into two straight lines.</li>

<li>Drawing the echoing lines.</li>

</ul>

<p>This method is a shortcut procedure to drawing form. It's about <strong>guessing line angles</strong> to build a structure that's solid without much concern for proportion. The lines may not be accurate yet, but it's a process of making decisions and refining them.</p>

<p>If you haven't worked on this, I recommend you rehearse this approach until it makes sense to you or even until it gets easy.</p>

<h2>The Grid Approach</h2>

<p>Now, let's explore a whole different exercise. Starting with accurate lines from a grid, we compare orthos (orthographic views) to foreshortened views and <strong>guess the proportions</strong>.</p>

<h3>Understanding Grids</h3>

<p>Grids can be <strong>bad</strong> and grids can be <strong>good</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Here's where they're good:</strong></p>

<ul>

<li>Grids make important invisible lines visible, establishing space in the picture.</li>

<li>They can be <strong>guidelines</strong>, like scaffoldings, helping you stay on track.</li>

<li>Grids help us draw by keeping track of line angles while we work on other things.</li>

<li>They structure our imagination, allowing us to create the views we desire.</li>

</ul>

<p><strong>Here's how they're bad:</strong></p>

<ul>

<li>They can feel restrictive, telling artists where to go.</li>

<li>Some artists see grids as shackles, limiting creativity.</li>

<li>Artists who don't want to conform to perspective or the observable world may dislike them.</li>

</ul>

<p>But remember, grids are tools we <strong>elect to use</strong> when we want to go in a certain direction.</p>

<h3>Grids in Practice</h3>

<p>Grids don't create artists, <strong>artists create grids</strong>. We use them for</p>

<ul>

<li>Down views or up views.</li>

<li>Simple or complex perspectives.</li>

<li>Loose or refined drawings.</li>

<li>Compressed space or wide angles.</li>

<li>Straight or warped perspectives.</li>

<li>Safe or daring compositions.</li>

</ul>

<p>Grids help by reminding us of turns and directions to hasten our journey.</p>

<h2>Foreshortening and Proportions</h2>

<h3>Learning from Kim Jung Gi</h3>

<p>Kim Jung Gi could fill walls with drawings at high speed with nothing to look at. You may wonder, <strong>how did he do it?</strong></p>

<p>He tells us his two secrets:</p>

<ol>

<li><strong>Know your subject's proportions.</strong> You've worked on that with orthos.</li>

<li><strong>Fit them into simple structures.</strong> These structures give you clues to how much you can dare to foreshorten.</li>

</ol>

<h3>Understanding Foreshortening</h3>

<p>Foreshortening makes a thing <strong>shorter</strong>. In an ortho, a line at its longest is just that, it can never be longer. As soon as a long line goes away or comes forward, it <strong>shortens</strong> compared to the ortho. It can shorten dramatically, it can turn into a dot.</p>

<p>In oblique views, a line, plane, or even a form will foreshorten <strong>a lot or a little</strong>. As you learn to draw foreshortened views, you can:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Play it safe</strong> to begin with minimal foreshortening.</li>

<li><strong>Dare to foreshorten</strong> and make bold adjustments.</li>

<li><strong>Get daring gradually</strong>, increasing the foreshortening over time.</li>

</ul>

<p>However, if you play it safe, a point of view that looks easy on one axis will imply that some other part will angle away severely. That's where we learn about how planes foreshorten, a little or a lot.</p>

<p>It can be scary drawing a line that you know is this long as <strong>this short</strong>. But when you do this several times, you gain courage to foreshorten until you overdo it and say, "This is a sword."</p>

<h2>Project Instructions</h2>

<h3>Preparing for the Project</h3>

<p>Get out your <strong>orthos</strong>. You're going to use them as reference.</p>

<h3>The Project</h3>

<p><strong>Redraw your form studies in new positions</strong> by looking at their orthos.</p>

<ul>

<li>If you feel confident, <strong>redraw them freehand</strong>.</li>

<li>If you don't feel confident or need guidance, <strong>use a grid</strong>. They give you a framework.</li>

</ul>

<p>Now that you know your subject's proportions, see if you can foreshorten them.</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>How tall?</strong></li>

<li><strong>How deep?</strong></li>

<li><strong>How wide?</strong></li>

</ul>

<p>Try to envision them onto and into a pre-existing spatial structure for support.</p>

<h3>Tips for the Project</h3>

<ul>

<li><strong>Grids mind the angles</strong>, you judge the proportion.</li>

<li>Don't try to measure, <strong>guess</strong>.</li>

<li>Some grids include measured depth that let us draw without guessing, but guessing is why we are doing this.</li>

<li>Work with just enough uncertainty to sharpen perception and grow into good guessing.</li>

<li>Keep attention on foreshortened planes and forms, <strong>ignoring detail</strong>.<ul>

<li>All that detail conforms to the simple form.</li>

</ul>

</li>

<li>Look along each of the axes and ask, <strong>how much does this portion foreshorten?</strong></li>

<li>Choose something simple enough to simplify and do this <strong>much more than once</strong>.</li>

</ul>

<p>One perfect drawing where you measure everything doesn't rehearse this imprinting experience. If you're aching to make precise drawings, you'll have your day, I assure you. <strong>Keep it loose here</strong>.</p>

<p>As your guidelining video teacher, I recommend that you start with more drawings, using the grid as a safety net for line directions.</p>

<h3>Experimenting with Distortions</h3>

<p>If you enjoy this, have some fun with some <strong>deliberate distortions</strong>. You can do what you want without even veering off grid. It's a choice, what you conform to.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p>This exercise teaches you to see, to notice foreshortening. Look back and forth between the ortho and oblique views.</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Ask yourself</strong>, does this look credible?</li>

<li><strong>Do the proportions look off?</strong></li>

</ul>

<p>Make intuitive guesses about axes and proportions. Use grids to imprint in your brain and to envision and conjure proportions into them.</p>

<p>And if you see grids as shackles, <strong>take on the shackles enough to emerge understanding unshackled</strong>.</p>
