<h2>Setting Up the Scene with Cool Night Tones</h2>

<p>Now, in this piece, I'm going to capture the <strong>cool of night</strong>. I like the deep blues in this scene. The foreground blue is really dark, and there's a lot of atmosphere here. I want to see a transition, this is a classic setup of <strong>foreground, mid-ground, and background</strong>.</p>

<h2>Using Fog for Depth</h2>

<p>Fog is such a powerful tool for illustration. It's used over and over again because it works. I think it's important not to shy away from experimenting with tried and true tools just to be original. In this scene, the fog helps create depth and atmosphere.</p>

<h2>Adjusting Colors and the Sky</h2>

<p>I'm trying to find that same kind of desaturated color. I do like this blue, but maybe the sky gets a little bit brighter in the background. The depth will be very similar to the fire scene I did before. The shape of the house will be somewhat of a dark silhouette against a lighter background because of the fog.</p>

<h2>Experimenting with Light Sources</h2>

<p>The difference here is where we paint this little <strong>pool of light</strong>. Is this pool of light coming from a lamp on the front of the building? In the reference, I think it's a street lamp. There's a lot of light in this reference that we could play with.</p>

<p>Right now, this sort of looks like the middle of the night. Painting and talking at the same time, my brain is going all over the place! I'm roughing in the keys here, and there's some really good darks in the foreground.</p>

<h2>Adding a Lamp to Create Focus</h2>

<p>Let's experiment with that pool of light. One thing we could definitely do is have the windows lit to draw attention to the place. But what would the pool of light be? Could there be a lamp?</p>

<p>I'm going to experiment with this. What if there's a lamp down here by the stairs, almost like an outdoor lamp? I'll paint a little lamp right there. This kind of draws our eyes if the character is walking up into a scene that has some light spillage there.</p>

<p>I'll add a little glow around that light, and then there could be light that bounces off the ground and up onto the house. That'll draw even more attention to the front door. We'll let this light just kind of spread a bit, coming from below and working its way up into the scene.</p>

<p>Maybe there's even more light at the base. This draws our attention to the base of the stairs and gives a little more complexity to the house. By removing one little line, there's my little lamp post. You see what that does? That's kind of cool. I like that.</p>

<h2>Tinting and Color Adjustments</h2>

<p>Maybe we'll tint this as well. I'm going to do an adjustment and use curves to take some of the green out of this, making it feel a little more warm. I'll take some of the blue out, add a little bit of that green back in, and bring the blue way down. It's an idea.</p>

<h2>Cleaning Up Lines and Defining Layers</h2>

<p>There could be brighter clouds in the background as well. I'll merge these layers together. Now, it's about cleaning up those lines that I've found. I still want to see the layering of mountains. I did that a little too dark right there. I want the layers to be very clear with this.</p>

<h2>Incorporating Low Mist and Fog</h2>

<p>I like the idea of this <strong>low mist</strong> that's kind of rolling in as well. Along the lake, maybe it gets a little bit brighter down by the water. It looks like the water is warmer than the air, so you get this kind of low fog that rolls in. It makes it really kind of creepy.</p>

<p>We could have that on this side too. It gives even more layering to the trees if you have that low, misty fog. And then, of course, we need to get the reflection of the sky in here, that will help pull this all together with our water.</p>

<p>Maybe there's more of that rolling mist right here by the water so that the character really stands out and their silhouette is as clear as possible. I'll get their shape back in there.</p>

<h2>Considering Character Lighting</h2>

<p>Then we try to decide: do we want a light that the character is holding? Let's just experiment with this. What if the character is holding a lamp too? That could be kind of cool. I'm just noticing maybe this needs a little dot of brightness on the side if the character was holding a lamp of some kind.</p>

<h2>Adjusting Character Design</h2>

<p>My character design, inside and outside, is really very cartoony. I think the one that I did inside is a little bit more realistic in the head shape. We can make the head a little smaller, it was a little bit more realistic there. I'm realizing the design differences in my sketch.</p>

<p>I think for clarity right now, the character has just a pure silhouette. Maybe it works, maybe it doesn't.</p>

<h2>Adding Mystery Rim Light</h2>

<p>One cheat that we could do, something that is very common in film, is to add <strong>mystery rim lights</strong>. You have to use these cautiously to still feel believable, but it's done often enough that I don't think most people will notice.</p>

<p>I can imagine there's skylight happening back here, kind of like in this image where they went brighter with the cloud in the sky. I don't feel like I really want that for this image, but on the roof, there is some of this little bit more cyan color.</p>

<p>So I could take this and experiment with putting just a little bit, almost like a rim light that's coming from this direction onto the character from the sky. It will just help get the shape of the feet. Maybe on top of some of these bushes, there's a little bit of this too.</p>

<p>These lights back here are probably not bright enough to really catch very much at all, all the way over to the character. So I don't think I would have a rim light from that light onto the character, it's a little too far for that. But we could put a little bit of a pool of light. We still want to have the contrast on the character.</p>

<p>It's an idea to experiment with, take a look, and see. I don't know if it's working on this bush. Trying to look at my silhouette there. Maybe if there's more mist and fog around the character where these trees are, it'll help it stand out a little bit better.</p>

<p>Yeah, that kind of works. This is pretty fun.</p>
