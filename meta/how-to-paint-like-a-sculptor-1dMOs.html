<p><strong>Planes</strong> are essential in painting as they describe changes in direction on a form. They create shapes that mimic the structure of the subject, giving a piece a more structured and sculptural feel. Carved planes provide a solid feel and make value changes more obvious compared to rounded edges. This approach helps in making drawings and paintings feel touchable rather than vague or soft.</p>

<h2>The Asaro Head as a Visual Aid</h2>

<p>The <strong>Asaro head</strong> is a valuable tool for artists to understand how planes work in art. It visually illustrates the structure of the head, helping artists grasp the concept of planes and apply it to their work.</p>

<h2>Choosing and Enhancing Planes</h2>

<p>When selecting subjects, I look for those with <strong>visible planes</strong>. For instance, our subject today has rounded corners but also well-defined cheekbones and facial planes. Although some areas, like the forehead, appear flat, I might enhance certain planes to achieve a more pronounced effect. This technique helps in emphasizing the structural aspects of the subject.</p>

<h2>Techniques for Painting Hair</h2>

<p>In painting hair, I aim to create <strong>chunkier planes</strong> to achieve a sculptural quality. The goal is to make the form feel touchable, enhancing the overall structure and depth of the artwork.</p>

<h2>Sculptural Art Philosophy</h2>

<p>I aspire for my work to be described as <strong>sculptural</strong>, a philosophy I learned from my teacher, Fred Fixer. He taught us to draw as if a sculptor would use our work to create a model. This approach ensures that the artwork is not only visually appealing but also structurally sound.</p>

<h2>Importance of Structural Details</h2>

<p>Indicating <strong>structural details</strong> is crucial for making a drawing useful for sculpting. It's important to avoid vague, soft, or overly linear drawings. Instead, focus on tonal work that shows form and structure. This makes the artwork more practical and valuable for sculptors.</p>

<h2>Thinking in Terms of Planes</h2>

<p>Always think in terms of <strong>planes</strong>, even in the details. This mindset helps in creating art that is not only visually striking but also useful and sculptural. By applying the concept of planes, artists can produce work that stands out and serves a practical purpose in the world of art.</p>
