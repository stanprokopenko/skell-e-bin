<h2>Big Hairy Audacious Goals (BHAGs)</h2>

<p>You live in a time where information about high performance and creativity is easy to find. Books, articles, and videos share what top performers do to excel. You can apply these principles to your art practice.</p>

<p>One idea from a famous business research study is to set <strong>Big Hairy Audacious Goals</strong>, what they call BHAGs. Even if your goal is huge and you fall short, you will likely go farther than if you had aimed for something small. For instance, if you aim to be the <strong>best figurative artist in the world</strong>, you may not reach that exact point, but you can surpass many typical goals. High targets push you to grow more.</p>

<h3>Why Visualization Works</h3>

<p>Almost all of our brain’s processing power is visual, which is good news if you’re in the visual arts. When you imagine a goal, your brain reacts as if it is real, you feel the excitement and maybe some nerves. Using this power of visualization can help you stay motivated, and work toward your BHAG.</p>

<h3>Set Points and Breaking Limits</h3>

<p>We all have mental “set points” or ceilings, which limit what we believe is possible. But when you look at the successes of others, whether through biographies, videos, or an in-person community, you see that great achievement is within reach. If someone else has done what seems impossible, you can do it, too. For the goals that deeply matter, allow yourself to dream big. Shatter the mental glass ceiling, and see how far you can go.</p>

<h2>Chunking Down</h2>

<p>“Chunking down” means analyzing and practicing smaller sections of what you want to master. Often, you might fill a page with quick poses or jump straight into a finished piece. That has value, but be sure to spend some time focusing on smaller parts of the figure or a specific technique. For example:</p>

<ul>

<li>Take a single pose and draw only the torso. Then do it again, focusing on how a round shape casts a curved shadow.  </li>

<li>Practice that small chunk repeatedly until you see improvement.  </li>

<li>Move to the next body part or section of the artwork.  </li>

</ul>

<p>These smaller studies build your understanding more effectively than always rushing through full drawings. It might not feel as exciting, but it will level up your skills.</p>

<h3>Shape and Form Analysis</h3>

<p>Try applying “chunking down” to master copies or photo references. If you study Michelangelo’s sculptures, break them into simple geometric forms like tubes, spheres, and cylinders, then see how these shapes turn, tuck under, or overlap. Doing this helps you understand the figure in three dimensions, which makes your shading and perspective more convincing.</p>

<h3>Balancing Fun and Focus</h3>

<p>Spending all your time on tiny details can get dull, so find a balance. Work on a full figure or painting for fun, but also devote a percentage of your study time to focused breakdowns. Little by little, you’ll see major changes in your confidence and skill.</p>

<h2>Immersion and Repetition</h2>

<p>To master anything, you need <strong>immersion</strong> (getting deeply involved with the subject) and <strong>repetition</strong> (doing it often). When you finish a course or section of material, repeat it. Go back to the beginning with your new understanding. You’ll see things that you missed the first time.</p>

<p>This also helps you simplify your process. Each time you revisit material, you notice what truly matters and discard the fluff. Over time, your art becomes stronger and more efficient.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p>Aim for a bigger goal than you think you can achieve. Practice in small, focused chunks to deepen your skills. Revisit lessons again and again, and keep learning from the many resources around you. You have so much potential to create remarkable art, you just have to commit to the process and believe you can do it. Good luck, and keep pushing forward!</p>
