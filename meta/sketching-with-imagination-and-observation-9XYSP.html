<p>Welcome to my sketchbook tour at Proko's 12 Days of Christmas. I'm James Gurney, and I'd like to share three sketchbooks with you. The first is a <strong>study book from 1985</strong>, the second is a more recent <strong>gouache sketchbook</strong>, and the third is a book being republished called <strong>"The Artist's Guide to Sketching"</strong> from 1982.</p>

<h2>The 1985 Study Book</h2>

<p>Back in 1985, when I was about 27 years old, I was teaching myself art after dropping out of art school. This notebook is where I took notes and did studies.</p>

<h3>Studying Masters Like Dean Cornwell</h3>

<p>One of my heroes was <strong>Dean Cornwell</strong>. I admired how he stylized forms, using straight lines against curves and contrasting light and dark modeling. I made notes in the margins to remind myself what to look for.</p>

<p>I studied his painting for a life insurance calendar in 1953 about the founding of New York. I focused on capturing the essence of the 32 figures using a soft pencil, probably a 2B or 3B.</p>

<h3>Notes and Thumbnails</h3>

<p>I sketched from reproductions in art books and museums. Some artists I studied were:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Samuel Nelson Abbott</strong></li>

<li><strong>Leon Bonnat</strong></li>

<li><strong>Edward J. Pointer</strong></li>

<li><strong>Frank Bramley</strong></li>

<li><strong>Caravaggio</strong></li>

<li><strong>Velázquez</strong></li>

</ul>

<p>I loved how <strong>Caravaggio</strong> divided his scenes into light and dark shapes. When visiting the Metropolitan Museum, I did quick line studies, like one of <strong>Juan de Pareja</strong> by <strong>Velázquez</strong>.</p>

<h3>Learning from Self-Taught Artists</h3>

<p>I'm a big believer in self-teaching. Some of my favorite self-taught artists are <strong>Adolph Menzel</strong> and <strong>Mort Drucker</strong> from Mad Magazine. Reading about old masters and how they worked helped me a lot.</p>

<h3>Early Sketches of Waterfall City</h3>

<p>In this sketchbook are the very first sketches for <strong>Waterfall City</strong>, which later led to <strong>Dinotopia</strong>. Back in 1985, I was imagining a fantasy city built on a waterfall.</p>

<h3>Importance of Sketching</h3>

<p><strong>Howard Pyle</strong>, founder of the Pyle School, emphasized doing lots of sketches before finalizing an idea. I took his advice to heart, generating many sketches and thumbnails for my illustrations.</p>

<h2>The Gouache Sketchbook</h2>

<p>This is a watercolor sketchbook made by Pentelic, filled with gouache paintings.</p>

<h3>Combining Media and Techniques</h3>

<p>I enjoy combining media like <strong>ballpoint pen</strong>, <strong>fountain pen</strong>, <strong>colored pencil</strong>, <strong>watercolor pencil</strong>, <strong>casein</strong>, and <strong>gouache</strong>. Experimenting with different combinations keeps things interesting. Sometimes I'll do a priming color in casein and build it up with gouache.</p>

<h3>Sketching Animals and Everyday Scenes</h3>

<p>I love painting animals from life. Here's a gouache study of a <strong>draft horse</strong> being washed down for the county fair. Capturing them in motion is a fun challenge.</p>

<p>I also like painting ordinary, unloved corners of the world, like the edge of a parking lot with trash and weeds. It's interesting to find beauty in overlooked places.</p>

<h3>Handling Edges and Transitions in Gouache</h3>

<p>When working with gouache, I build from the background to the foreground. Gouache allows me to have <strong>hard edges</strong> but also to <strong>soften edges</strong> later with a wet brush. Having a range of edges adds depth to the painting.</p>

<h2>The Artist's Guide to Sketching</h2>

<p>This book tells the story of when my friend <strong>Thomas Kinkade</strong> and I dropped out of art school and rode freight trains across America.</p>

<h3>Our Adventure Riding Freight Trains</h3>

<p>We met a hobo named Bud who taught us how to ride the freights. We slept in graveyards, on rooftops, and even on top of a hay truck. This adventure became the basis for <strong>"The Artist's Guide to Sketching"</strong>, originally published in 1982 and now being republished.</p>

<h3>Emphasizing Imagination and Storytelling</h3>

<p>We emphasized that you don't have to draw exactly what you see. For example, I drew an antique store and imagined all the furniture taken outside, adding made-up signs. There's always room to heighten reality in a painting.</p>

<h3>Capturing Motion</h3>

<p>Capturing motion requires practice. I use a method I call the <strong>flash glance method</strong>. I follow the subject with my eyes and then close them at the moment I want to remember. The afterimage helps me capture the pose.</p>

<p>Before photography, artists had to rely on such methods to depict movement. For example, people didn't know how horses moved at a gallop until <strong>Eadweard Muybridge</strong> photographed them.</p>

<h2>Questions and Answers</h2>

<h3>Favorite Memories While Sketching</h3>

<p>One of my favorite memories is when I was sketching sheep and chickens, but they moved before I could finish. Later, in a pub, I drew a man and his wife and combined the incomplete animal sketches with the people, creating a fun and unique drawing.</p>

<h3>Tackling Complex Subjects</h3>

<p>When drawing complicated subjects like oil refineries with many lines in perspective, I set up a <strong>perspective grid</strong>. I look for the highest line I can measure, draw that, and establish the horizontal eye level.</p>

<h3>Warming Up Before Painting and Drawing</h3>

<p>On location, I sometimes dive right in with a brush, but usually, I start with a pencil drawing. In the studio, I begin with lots of quick sketches and thumbnail drawings. The more ideas I generate, the better the final result will be.</p>

<h3>Sculpting 3D Maquettes for Reference</h3>

<p>I often sculpt <strong>3D maquettes</strong> as references, especially for cast shadows and lighting. For example, I sculpted a <strong>Titanoboa</strong> strangling an alligator to study the lighting and shadows. Even if you're not an experienced sculptor, creating a simple model can greatly improve your work.</p>

<h3>My Favorite Dinosaur</h3>

<p>My favorite dinosaurs are the <strong>Microraptor</strong> and the <strong>Stegosaurus</strong>. I love their unlikely designs, like the Microraptor's four wings and the Stegosaurus's plates. Nature comes up with ideas we never would have dreamed of as concept artists.</p>

<h2>Closing Thoughts</h2>

<p>Art is a lifelong journey of learning and exploration. Whether sketching from life or imagination, combining media, or experimenting with new techniques, there's always something new to discover. Keep exploring, keep experimenting, and most importantly, keep creating.</p>
