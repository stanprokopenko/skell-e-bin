<h2>Simple Forms for Complex Anatomy</h2>

<p>You want to keep the figure as <strong>simple as possible</strong> while still being <strong>true to the body’s character</strong>. For the arms, start with <strong>tube shapes</strong>. These tubes can shift into <strong>boxes</strong> or <strong>balls</strong> later, as you need more structure. Your main goal is to find a <strong>straightforward design</strong> that fits the pose and maintains the energy of the figure.</p>

<h2>Curvature and Symmetry</h2>

<p>Most of the body’s <strong>limbs</strong>, such as arms, wrists, and hands, are <strong>asymmetrical</strong>. This means they tend to exhibit <strong>curvy, fluid lines</strong> if you map their long axes. The head, neck, and torso, by contrast, are <strong>symmetrical</strong> structures and often appear <strong>stiffer</strong> when viewed head-on. When limbs move to a more <strong>profile</strong> view, they naturally reveal their curves.</p>

<h2>Iterating Your Drawings</h2>

<p><strong>Iteration</strong> is the key to better understanding and improved skill. You:

- Sketch a simple shape, like a tube for the upper arm.<br />

- Evaluate it for <strong>shape</strong>, <strong>proportion</strong>, <strong>tilt</strong>, and <strong>curvature</strong>.<br />

- <strong>Refine</strong> and try again, each time making the design more accurate.  </p>

<p>You’ll make quick progress if you do several iterations. This builds <strong>mastery</strong>, which motivates you to keep practicing.</p>

<h2>Fitting the Upper Arm</h2>

<p>The <strong>upper arm</strong> connects to a <strong>bulging shoulder</strong> area. Even though the shoulder can be complicated, treat it as a <strong>corner</strong> that attaches to the tube of the upper arm. From the <strong>front</strong> or <strong>back</strong>, the upper arm can appear fairly <strong>straight</strong>. Sometimes you’ll see a slight <strong>taper</strong> from the shoulder to the elbow. Other times you’ll notice a <strong>curve</strong> on the inside or outside. Keep checking for:

- <strong>Thickness</strong> differences (shoulder vs. elbow).<br />

- Subtle or more obvious <strong>curves</strong>.<br />

- The <strong>position</strong> or <strong>angle</strong> relative to the torso.</p>

<h2>Adding Other Structures for Accuracy</h2>

<p>Occasionally, you’ll want to draw parts of the <strong>torso</strong> or <strong>rib cage</strong> to see how the upper arm relates to them. Include basic shapes for the rib cage, collarbone, or armpit to help confirm you’ve captured the right tilt, proportion, and curve of the arm. If your first pass feels sloppy, clean it up in a new iteration with <strong>clearer lines and simpler shapes</strong>.</p>

<h2>Refining Through Practice</h2>

<p>You’ll get a <strong>keener eye</strong> for spotting small changes in position, proportion, and curvature if you keep revisiting the same subject from different angles. Tweak the design in each fresh attempt:

- <strong>Check shape design</strong>: Straight vs. curved edges.<br />

- <strong>Adjust proportions</strong>: Overall length to width.<br />

- <strong>Assess position</strong>: Does it tilt forward, backward, or stay vertical?  </p>

<p>With each pass, you’ll get <strong>better results</strong> and sharper observation skills.</p>

<h2>Looking Ahead</h2>

<p>Once you feel comfortable with your approach to the upper arm, you can move on to attaching the <strong>forearm</strong> and exploring how it curves and connects. Keep your method of <strong>simple forms</strong> and <strong>iteration</strong> going, and you’ll continue to see your drawing skills strengthen.</p>
