<p>Here we are in the final section of this tutorial, where we put together all the information and knowledge we've learned from previous sections and take on a full-color portrait. I chose this specific reference image due to its strong, easy-to-read lighting that sets us up for success. It has appealing shapes, clear separation of lights and darks, and a simple background that allows us to clearly see the silhouette and all the shapes.</p>

<p>I strongly recommend that you <strong>follow along</strong> and tackle these assignments yourself. Try to draw and paint alongside me, and together we'll put in the pencil mileage and brush mileage to get better.</p>

<h2>Setting Up the Canvas</h2>

<p>First, we'll create a <strong>wash</strong>. I use the square selection tool to define the composition area. Then, I hit <strong>G</strong> for the paint bucket tool and select a saturated dark cadmium orange. I might lighten it up just a bit.</p>

<h2>Drawing the Initial Sketch</h2>

<p>Since we'll spend a good amount of time on this portrait, we want to take our time with the drawing to ensure all the shapes and alignments are correct. I'll use a mixture of the <strong>Loomis method</strong> and carving out shapes with straights and angles to define the silhouette before we start painting.</p>

<h3>Establishing the Loomis Head</h3>

<ul>

<li>Start with a <strong>simple sphere</strong>.</li>

<li>Carve out the <strong>side plane</strong>.</li>

<li><strong>Divide the sphere</strong> in half vertically and horizontally.</li>

<li>Pay close attention to the <strong>eye line</strong>, noting any tilt. In this case, it's tilted slightly down towards the right.</li>

<li>Establish the <strong>T of the face</strong> to divide the face vertically.</li>

<li>Block in the <strong>jawline</strong> and neck gesture.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Blocking In Major Shapes</h3>

<ul>

<li>Roughly place the gesture of the <strong>neck</strong>.</li>

<li>Block in the <strong>silhouette of the hair</strong>, focusing on large shapes before breaking them into smaller ones.</li>

<li>Keep everything very <strong>graphic and flat</strong> at this point.</li>

<li>Note that the <strong>base of the ear</strong> lines up with the <strong>base of the nose</strong>.</li>

<li>Block in the <strong>keystone</strong> (glabella) area.</li>

<li>Roughly place the <strong>eyebrows</strong>, pulling up from the corners of the glabella.</li>

<li>Establish the <strong>lip line</strong>, using the rule that it's one-third the distance from the base of the nose to the base of the chin.</li>

<li>Define the <strong>cupid's bow</strong> and the base of the lower lip.</li>

<li>Indicate the <strong>side planes of the face</strong> and the cheeks.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Refining the Sketch</h3>

<ul>

<li>Lightly indicate the <strong>neck muscles</strong> and the <strong>cast shadow</strong> under the jaw.</li>

<li>Break up the hair into smaller clumps to simplify the shapes.</li>

<li>Add a <strong>light value wash</strong> to the hair to separate it from the face.</li>

<li>Adjust the <strong>shoulders</strong>, paying attention to their tilt and width.</li>

<li>Continuously check <strong>relationships and alignments</strong>.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Making Corrections</h2>

<ul>

<li>Use <strong>straight lines</strong> to check points and angles.</li>

<li>Use the <strong>lasso tool (L)</strong> to select and move features that need adjusting.</li>

<li>Keep features <strong>parallel</strong> and maintain <strong>symmetry</strong> using the T of the face as a guide.</li>

<li>Erase extraneous construction lines to keep the drawing <strong>clean</strong>, especially for softer features like those of a female face.</li>

<li>Refine features like the <strong>eyes</strong>, <strong>nose</strong>, and <strong>mouth</strong>, making sure everything is lined up correctly.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Blocking In Flat Colors</h2>

<p>Now that the drawing feels solid, we'll move on to establishing the <strong>local colors</strong>.</p>

<h3>Organizing Layers</h3>

<p>In Photoshop, I organize my layers as follows:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Wash layer</strong>: The initial color wash.</li>

<li><strong>Flat color layer</strong>: Contains the flat colors, placed beneath the line layer.</li>

<li><strong>Line layer</strong>: Contains the clean line work.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Establishing Skin Tone</h3>

<ul>

<li>Look at the <strong>mid-tones</strong> closer to the core shadows.</li>

<li>Choose a color with a bit more <strong>yellow</strong>, lighter in value.</li>

<li>Don't hesitate to <strong>experiment</strong> until you find a color that looks right.</li>

<li>Fill in all areas where there's <strong>skin</strong>, treating it like a coloring book.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Adding Hair Color</h3>

<ul>

<li>Choose a <strong>desaturated red</strong> for the hair, adjusting as needed.</li>

<li>Block in the <strong>hair</strong>, again focusing on large shapes.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Coloring Features</h3>

<ul>

<li>Use the same hair color for the <strong>eyebrows</strong> and <strong>eyelashes</strong>, keeping the shapes graphic and streamlined.</li>

<li>For the <strong>irises</strong>, use the same color as the hair.</li>

<li>For the whites of the eyes (<strong>scleras</strong>), select the surrounding flesh tone and move it towards desaturated on the color wheel. Avoid pure white to prevent the eyes from looking unnatural.</li>

<li>For the <strong>lips</strong>, choose a darker color with more red.</li>

<li>Fill in any other local colors, such as clothing straps or background elements.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Adding the Background</h3>

<ul>

<li>Use a similar color for the <strong>background</strong> as used for any clothing or accessories.</li>

<li>Use selection tools to fill in the background without affecting the subject.</li>

<li>Leave some texture and areas where the wash color shows through for a traditional feel.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Separating Lights and Darks</h2>

<p>Next, we'll create a <strong>lights/darks layer</strong> between the flat color and line layers.</p>

<h3>Blocking in Shadow Shapes</h3>

<ul>

<li>Select the local skin color and adjust it to be slightly <strong>darker</strong> and more <strong>desaturated</strong>.</li>

<li>Squint your eyes to see the simplified shapes of light and shadow.</li>

<li>Block in the <strong>shadows</strong>, starting with obvious areas like the neck and under the lower lip.</li>

<li>Compress values into simplified shapes, focusing on <strong>design</strong>.</li>

<li>Apply the same process to the <strong>hair</strong>, considering the shadow shapes as dark accents.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Using the Magic Wand Tool</h3>

<ul>

<li>Use the magic wand tool (<strong>W</strong>) on the flat color layer to select areas like the hair.</li>

<li>This allows you to paint shadow shapes within specific areas without affecting others, saving time.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Adding Highlights and Dark Accents</h2>

<h3>Creating a Highlights Layer</h3>

<ul>

<li>Create a new layer for <strong>highlights</strong>.</li>

<li>Select the skin color and adjust it to be <strong>lighter</strong> and slightly <strong>cooler</strong> or more desaturated.</li>

<li>Use the <strong>polygonal lasso tool</strong> to keep highlight shapes graphic.</li>

<li>Place highlights on areas like the <strong>forehead</strong>, <strong>nose</strong>, <strong>cheeks</strong>, and <strong>lips</strong>.</li>

<li>Think of using <strong>tapering shapes and triangles</strong> in your design.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Creating a Dark Accents Layer</h3>

<ul>

<li>Create another layer for <strong>dark accents</strong>.</li>

<li>Choose a dark <strong>red-orange</strong> color, avoiding pure black to keep the image vibrant.</li>

<li>Add dark accents in areas of <strong>occlusion</strong>, such as:<ul>

<li><strong>Corners of the mouth</strong></li>

<li><strong>Nostrils</strong></li>

<li><strong>Corners of the eyes</strong></li>

<li><strong>Inside the ear</strong></li>

<li><strong>Under the chin and neck</strong></li>

</ul>

</li>

</ul>

<h3>Adjusting the Line Layer</h3>

<ul>

<li><strong>Reduce</strong> the opacity of the line layer.</li>

<li>Use <strong>Ctrl + U</strong> to bring up the hue/saturation sliders.</li>

<li>Check <strong>Colorize</strong> and adjust the lightness and saturation to colorize the lines.</li>

<li><strong>Erase</strong> unnecessary lines to keep the image clean.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Flattening Layers and Blending</h2>

<p>Now we'll flatten the layers and begin blending.</p>

<h3>Flattening the Layers</h3>

<ul>

<li><strong>Group</strong> all the layers and label the group (e.g., <strong>Separated Layers</strong>).</li>

<li>Use <strong>Shift + Ctrl + Alt + E</strong> to create a new layer that consolidates all visible layers.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Blending and Softening Edges</h3>

<ul>

<li>Use the <strong>blender brush</strong> to soften transitions between areas.</li>

<li>Blend the edges of shadow shapes, keeping some edges crisp for contrast.</li>

<li>Switch between the blender brush and your <strong>textured brush</strong> to add texture and noise.</li>

<li><strong>Leave some lines</strong> and textures visible to give the painting a handcrafted feel.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Adding Subsurface Scattering</h3>

<ul>

<li>In areas transitioning from light to shadow, add warmer tones to indicate <strong>subsurface scattering</strong>.</li>

<li>This is often found near core shadows and cast shadows.</li>

<li>These warmer tones give the skin a more lifelike appearance.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Refining and Detailing</h2>

<h3>Adding Secondary Light</h3>

<ul>

<li>Observe any <strong>secondary light sources</strong> affecting the subject.</li>

<li>In this case, there's a subtle cooler light hitting the sides of the face and neck.</li>

<li>Use a desaturated magenta or appropriate color to represent this light.</li>

<li>Apply it to areas like the <strong>side of the cheek</strong>, <strong>neck</strong>, and <strong>lips</strong>.</li>

<li>Soften the edges slightly to integrate it smoothly.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Enhancing Features</h3>

<ul>

<li>Refine facial features, such as the <strong>eyes</strong>, <strong>nose</strong>, and <strong>mouth</strong>.</li>

<li>Add small details like the <strong>highlights on the eyes</strong> and <strong>lips</strong>.</li>

<li>Correct any proportional issues that become apparent during painting.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Adding Texture and Final Touches</h3>

<ul>

<li>Add <strong>texture</strong> to areas like the hair using smaller brushstrokes.</li>

<li>Introduce subtle variations in <strong>color and value</strong> to enhance realism.</li>

<li>Use <strong>modeling brushstrokes</strong> to indicate planes and forms.</li>

<li>Leave some lines and textures visible to give the painting a <strong>handcrafted feel</strong>.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Final Blending</h3>

<ul>

<li>Use the blender brush to blend areas further if needed.</li>

<li>Focus on areas that need smoother transitions.</li>

<li>Continually step back and view the painting as a whole to ensure harmony.</li>

</ul>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p>Most of the hard work is at the very beginning, taking the time and having the patience to create a <strong>strong foundation</strong>. After that, it's about adding the icing on the cake, refining details.</p>

<p>A few key takeaways:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Organize your values and shapes</strong>: Design and separate your lights and darks early on. This makes your painting more readable and appealing when viewed from a distance.</li>

<li><strong>Strong drawing foundation</strong>: A clean, organized drawing provides a map for your painting. Ensuring symmetry and correct alignments prevents issues later on.</li>

<li><strong>Color and temperature</strong>: If you have cooler highlights in the light areas, make your shadows warmer to create separation and depth.</li>

<li><strong>Texture and brushwork</strong>: Adding small brushstrokes and texture can bring energy to your painting and give it a traditional feel.</li>

</ul>

<p>I hope you enjoyed this tutorial and learned a lot from this series. I promise you, if you take the time and make the effort to study all the individual facial features, it'll be much easier for you to tackle full portraits. Keep practicing, and until the next tutorial!</p>
