<p>We know that perspective adds depth to our drawings, but perspective alone isn't enough to make a drawing look realistic. The trick is often in effectively shading <strong>light and shadow</strong>. Understanding how light interacts with form is a big deal if you want to start shading. I would argue that proper shading has an even bigger impact on depth and realism than perspective. Sorry, Marshall. I've seen many students struggle with this. They draw beautiful outlines but then completely flatten their forms with incorrect shading. Let's not do that anymore. Let's learn how to shade.</p>

<h2>Light Reveals Planes</h2>

<p>When light hits an object, it reveals the object's <strong>planes</strong>. Imagine them as small flat tiles spread across the surface. The planes facing the light will be lighter than the planes facing away. Adding another plane between these introduces a new intermediate value. So, when we shade, <strong>every value change we make on a form suggests a plane change</strong>.</p>

<p>Even on smooth forms like spheres, thinking of them as composed of many smaller planes helps you imagine how the form turns.</p>

<h2>Organizing Light and Shadow</h2>

<p><strong>Planes facing the light</strong> are part of the <strong>light family</strong>, and planes facing away are part of the <strong>shadow family</strong>. When we shade, we need to clearly communicate which parts of the object are in light and which are in shadow. This simple organization of values into two families does the most in communicating form. It's not everything, but it's definitely the place to start.</p>

<h2>Parts of Light and Shadow</h2>

<p>Let's start simple: a sphere on a surface with one light source. Light on form is typically broken down into distinct zones. You'll see the divisions more clearly on simple forms with simple lighting, but once you get it, you can apply it to anything. Before we get into the details, let's quickly introduce the elements of light on form.</p>

<h3>Elements of Light on Form</h3>

<ul>

<li><strong>Terminator</strong>: The edge where light transitions into shadow.</li>

<li><strong>Form Shadow</strong>: The area that's turned away from the light source.<ul>

<li>Different from the <strong>cast shadow</strong>, which occurs when an object blocks light from hitting another surface.</li>

</ul>

</li>

<li><strong>Center Light</strong>: The point facing directly toward the light source.</li>

<li><strong>Halftones</strong>: As the form turns away from the center light, we see darker and darker halftones until they reach the terminator.</li>

<li><strong>Highlights</strong>: Reflections of the light source itself.<ul>

<li>You won't see them on matte materials.</li>

</ul>

</li>

<li><strong>Reflected Light</strong>: Light bouncing around the environment that gently lightens some areas within the shadows.</li>

<li><strong>Core Shadow</strong>: The darkest part of a form shadow, usually along the terminator.</li>

<li><strong>Occlusion Shadows</strong>: Found in tight crevices where objects touch.<ul>

<li>Occlusion shadows are commonly the darkest values.</li>

<li>They're like the highlights of the shadow family.</li>

</ul>

</li>

</ul>

<h2>The Value Structure</h2>

<p>You already know how to think in terms of limited value groups like light, medium, and dark. Let's use that to group the elements we just learned into value zones with hard edges. No blending or gradations. Let's just observe the values.</p>

<h3>Separating Light and Shadow</h3>

<p>Separate the light and shadow by <strong>blocking in your entire shadow area with a darker value representing the reflected light</strong>. You're saying this is the lightest that the shadow can get.</p>

<p>In the <strong>light family</strong>, I like to think of <strong>three values</strong>:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Lightest halftone</strong>: The biggest area.</li>

<li><strong>Middle halftone</strong>.</li>

<li><strong>Darkest halftone</strong>: The smallest area.</li>

</ul>

<p>If the form you're drawing has a <strong>highlight</strong>, then I'll simplify the halftones to just <strong>light halftone</strong> and <strong>dark halftone</strong>. I'll use that third, brightest value for a clear <strong>highlight shape</strong>.</p>

<h3>Shadows</h3>

<p>In the <strong>shadow family</strong>, within the form shadow, I like to think of just <strong>two values</strong>:</p>

<ul>

<li>The value we put down originally to define the shadow is the <strong>reflected light</strong>. It's the lightest part of the shadow.</li>

<li>Add a darker value for the <strong>core shadow</strong>.</li>

<li>We can give the <strong>occlusion shadow</strong> the same value as the core shadow.</li>

</ul>

<p>We would have a total of <strong>five values</strong>:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Three in the lights</strong> and <strong>two in the shadows</strong>.</li>

<li>Favoring more detail and complexity in the lights.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Refining the Values</h3>

<p>In reality, the <strong>occlusion shadow</strong> is usually even darker than the core shadow. Sometimes, depending on the environment and how much light bounces back into the cast shadow, the rest of the cast shadow might be darker too, closer to the value of the core shadow. As cast shadows go farther away from the object, the edges get softer. If you want to get really technical, you can use some of the values from the light family to transition the cast shadow into the light around those blurry edges.</p>

<h2>Understanding Transitions</h2>

<p>Shading form isn't as simple as smudging gradations across our shapes, unfortunately. It's never a linear gradation from light to shadow. Instead, we <strong>bounce around</strong> a bit. Some steps are subtle, others are more dramatic. The transitions within the lighter halftones are very subtle, while the jump from halftone to core shadow is usually quicker and more obvious. After the core shadow, we get lighter again because of the reflected lights, then it becomes darker for the occlusion, and lighter again as the occlusion transitions to the cast shadow.</p>

<p>Of course, this is just a simplified example to help you understand the relationships. This pattern and the values I used here are not a hard rule. The exact value steps will vary based on the object and the light source. What matters most is <strong>maintaining the correct relationship between these values</strong>.</p>

<h2>Practice and Intuition</h2>

<p>As you practice, you'll develop an intuition for how light describes form, and you'll be more comfortable with all the subtle shifts in value that create realistic depth. You'll start to feel when a value or transition is wrong.</p>

<p><strong>Light and shadow are tools to create the illusion of three dimensions on a flat surface. Master these tools, and your drawings won't look flat.</strong></p>
