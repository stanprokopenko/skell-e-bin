<h2>What's in Premium?</h2>

<p>In this lesson, we explore the importance of <strong>value relationships</strong> in drawing. You'll learn how surrounding values influence perception, making identical values appear different depending on context. We'll examine optical illusions like the <strong>checkerboard illusion</strong> to understand how our brains can be tricked by expectations.</p>

<p>We'll discuss how to <strong>override automatic labels</strong>, helping you avoid common mistakes like assuming the white of the eye is always white. You'll discover techniques to prevent <strong>tunnel vision</strong>, such as flipping your drawing, using a mirror, and <strong>squinting</strong> to see overall value relationships.</p>

<p>The lesson highlights the power of squinting to simplify values and identify primary forms. We'll also look at using digital tools like Photoshop's median filter as training aids, while encouraging you to develop intuitive skills without relying on software.</p>

<p>By practicing these methods, you'll train your eyes to perceive true values over assumed ones, enhancing your ability to depict light, shadow, and form accurately in your drawings.</p>
