<p>Welcome to the first critique for the gesture course. In this project, we're seeing if you can replicate some of the <strong>proportions</strong> we went through in the second lesson. Many of you have done a great job, but there's always room for refinement. Let's dive into some common areas for improvement and explore ways to enhance your understanding of proportions and anatomy in gesture drawing.</p>

<h2>Common Mistakes in Proportions</h2>

<h3>Sizing the Width of the Head to the Rib Cage and Pelvis</h3>

<p>A common mistake is misaligning the <strong>width of the head</strong> with the <strong>rib cage and pelvis</strong>. Ensure that the <strong>width of the head</strong> matches the width of the <strong>rib cage</strong> and <strong>pelvis</strong>. Sometimes, the head may appear too wide or narrow compared to the body. Double-check your distances to maintain consistent proportions.</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Tip</strong>: Use the head as a unit of measurement. The width of the head should align with key points on the body.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Understanding the Eight-Head Division</h2>

<p>Most of you have successfully applied the <strong>eight-head division</strong> in your drawings. Remember, this division helps maintain proportions throughout the figure:</p>

<ol>

<li><strong>Head 1</strong>: Top of the head to the chin.</li>

<li><strong>Heads 2-4</strong>: Down to the bottom of the rib cage.</li>

<li><strong>Heads 4-6</strong>: Down to the pelvis.</li>

<li><strong>Heads 6-8</strong>: Legs down to the feet.</li>

</ol>

<p>Ensure you're consistently applying these divisions to keep your figures proportionate.</p>

<h2>Adding Anatomical Details</h2>

<p>While gesture drawing focuses on capturing the essence of a pose, integrating some anatomical details can enhance your understanding and depiction of the human form.</p>

<h3>The Sternum as a Necktie Analogy</h3>

<p>Think of the <strong>sternum</strong> as a <strong>big necktie</strong>:</p>

<ul>

<li>The <strong>top of the sternum</strong> (manubrium) is like the knot of the tie.</li>

<li>It extends down to the <strong>second head</strong>, resembling the length of the tie.</li>

<li>There's a small piece of cartilage at the bottom called the <strong>xiphoid process</strong>, which makes it look like a sword.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Differences Between Male and Female Rib Cages</h3>

<p>Understanding the nuances between male and female rib cages can add realism:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Male Rib Cage</strong>: Typically has a <strong>90-degree</strong> thoracic arch. Represent this by bowing the curve <strong>upward</strong>.</li>

<li><strong>Female Rib Cage</strong>: Tends towards a <strong>60-degree</strong> thoracic arch. Draw two curves that <strong>drop down</strong>.</li>

</ul>

<p>These distinctions help in customizing your figures based on gender.</p>

<h2>Building the Pelvis with Precision</h2>

<h3>The Checkerboard Method</h3>

<p>To construct the pelvis with more precision:</p>

<ol>

<li><strong>Divide the pelvis box into thirds</strong> both horizontally and vertically, creating a checkerboard pattern.</li>

<li><strong>Draw a diagonal</strong> from the top corner to the first division horizontally.</li>

<li>This diagonal gives you the angle of the <strong>ilium</strong> bones.</li>

</ol>

<h3>The "Mickey Mouse" Analogy</h3>

<p>Visualize the pelvis as resembling <strong>Mickey Mouse</strong>:</p>

<ul>

<li>The <strong>ears</strong> represent the <strong>iliac crests</strong>.</li>

<li>The <strong>face</strong> is the <strong>pubic symphysis</strong>.</li>

<li>This analogy helps in remembering the key landmarks and their placements.</li>

</ul>

<p>By incorporating these methods, you can achieve a more accurate representation of the pelvis in your drawings.</p>

<h2>Placing Limbs Correctly</h2>

<h3>Adjusting Leg Lengths</h3>

<p>Ensure your legs are proportionate:</p>

<ul>

<li>In an <strong>eight-head figure</strong>, the <strong>knees</strong> should be at the <strong>sixth head</strong>.</li>

<li>If your legs appear too long or short, adjust the placement of the knees accordingly.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Understanding Knee Placement</h3>

<p>When drawing knees:</p>

<ul>

<li>Use the <strong>halfway point</strong> between the pelvis and feet for knee placement.</li>

<li>Represent the knee joint with a <strong>cylinder</strong> or <strong>hinge</strong>, showing the connection between the femur and lower leg.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Adding Scapula and Clavicle</h2>

<p>Incorporate the <strong>scapula</strong> (shoulder blades) and <strong>clavicle</strong> (collarbone) for more detailed anatomy:</p>

<ul>

<li>From the <strong>back view</strong>, the scapula can be drawn as <strong>triangles</strong> positioned a <strong>head width apart</strong>.</li>

<li>The clavicle connects to the <strong>acromion process</strong> on the scapula, allowing for arm movement.</li>

<li><strong>Male Clavicle</strong>: Has a <strong>higher lift</strong>.</li>

<li><strong>Female Clavicle</strong>: Tends to be more <strong>horizontal</strong>.</li>

</ul>

<p>These details contribute to the realism of your figures.</p>

<h2>Drawing the Arms and Hands</h2>

<p>When sketching arms:</p>

<ul>

<li>The <strong>elbow</strong> aligns with the <strong>bottom of the rib cage</strong>.</li>

<li>The <strong>wrist</strong> falls at the <strong>top of the pelvis</strong>.</li>

<li>The <strong>hand</strong> extends halfway down the <strong>femur</strong>.</li>

</ul>

<p>Remember to consider the <strong>carrying angle</strong>:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Women</strong> often have a <strong>greater carrying angle</strong>, causing the arms to angle outward slightly.</li>

<li><strong>Men</strong> typically have a <strong>straighter alignment</strong>.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Considerations in Gesture Drawing</h2>

<h3>Don't Worry Too Much About Male/Female Adjustments Yet</h3>

<p>At this stage, focus on capturing the <strong>basic framework</strong> of the pose:</p>

<ul>

<li>Concentrate on overall proportions rather than specific male or female characteristics.</li>

<li>Detailed adjustments can be made later when adding muscles and fat pads.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Focus on Basic Proportions First</h3>

<p>Establishing accurate proportions is crucial:</p>

<ul>

<li>Use the <strong>head</strong> as your primary unit of measurement.</li>

<li>Ensure the <strong>rib cage, pelvis, and limbs</strong> are proportionate to each other.</li>

<li>Regularly <strong>double-check</strong> your measurements throughout the drawing process.</li>

</ul>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p>Refining your understanding of proportions and integrating basic anatomical details can greatly enhance your gesture drawings. Remember, repetition is key. Keep practicing these techniques, and over time, youâ€™ll notice significant improvements in your work. Don't hesitate to revisit these concepts and continue refining your skills. Happy drawing!</p>
