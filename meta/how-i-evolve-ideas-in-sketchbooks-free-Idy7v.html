<h2>What's in Premium?</h2>

<p>Hi, I'm Faith, an artist in animation, comics, and illustration. In this premium lesson, I share how I use three different sketchbooks to enhance my creative process:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>The Planning Sketchbook</strong>: My workspace for thumbnailing ideas, exploring compositions, and developing projects like tarot illustrations, mythological pieces, and character designs.</li>

<li><strong>The Relaxation Sketchbook</strong>: A place for free-flowing creativity using ink brushes and markers, where I experiment with themes like fairies, monster girls, and seasonal concepts.</li>

<li><strong>The Travel Sketchbook</strong>: Filled with sketches from life during my travels, capturing experiences that inspire future artwork and influence how I think about color and composition.</li>

</ul>

<p>You'll learn how each sketchbook serves a unique purpose in planning, relaxation, and capturing inspirations, contributing to artistic growth.</p>
