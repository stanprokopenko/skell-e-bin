<h2>Starting the Skull Study</h2>

<p>I chose to study a Guinea fowl skull from my Skull and Bones reference pack. Skulls are perfect for simplifying complex forms, they combine simple shapes with intricate details. This skull's cool crest gave it a fantasy or dinosaur-like vibe. It was a fun subject.</p>

<h2>Setting Up the Canvas</h2>

<p>In Photoshop, I started with a big canvas and shrank my reference image, cropping unnecessary space. Opting for a casual mindset, I skipped creating a frame and began with brushy strokes, letting the edges taper out naturally.</p>

<h2>Working from Big Shapes to Small</h2>

<p>My strategy was to <strong>work from big shapes to small shapes</strong>. Rather than starting with a sketch, I pretended to have a small canvas and broad brush. I kept my strokes broad, zoomed out, and squinted to focus on big shapes of value and color.</p>

<p>I laid in dark brown and light yellow values, the dominant impressions. Ignoring intricate details at first, I concentrated on big forms. I aimed for general accuracy, to keep the study fast and expressive.</p>

<h2>Observing Light and Color</h2>

<p>To make the skull feel three-dimensional, I observed how light interacted with it. A direct white light from above, warm yellow light reflecting off the surface, and cool ambient light influenced the colors. The beak's tip reflected cool tones, while downward planes were warmer.</p>

<p>Including the <strong>cast shadow</strong> was crucial for conveying volume. Anything that blocks light casts a shadow, enhancing the illusion of form.</p>

<h2>Adding Details Carefully</h2>

<p>I refined existing shapes before adding complexity, practicing restraint. When I added smaller shapes, it was satisfying. I focused on the <strong>impression of light</strong> rather than copying every detail.</p>

<h2>Using Photoshop Tools Effectively</h2>

<p>Using Photoshop's <strong>mixer brushes</strong> from my master pack, I achieved a traditional texture. In digital art, creating surface texture prevents a mushy look. Humans appreciate the tactile feel in images.</p>

<p>I let brush texture imply details instead of overworking them, keeping the painting loose.</p>

<h2>Maintaining a Loose Painterly Look</h2>

<p>Aiming for a loose look, I imposed limitations. Zooming in to add tiny details would ruin the vibe, so I stayed zoomed out. Flipping the canvas gave me fresh perspective.</p>

<p>As I neared completion, I added final touches while avoiding overworking.</p>

<p>I hope this inspires you to <strong>strategize your paintings</strong> and embrace limitations, especially for a painterly style. With this reference pack, you can choose any approach, detailed studies, line drawings, or expressive works.</p>

<p>I'm content with this study and might refine it later with fresh eyes. Taking a break can greatly benefit your work.</p>
