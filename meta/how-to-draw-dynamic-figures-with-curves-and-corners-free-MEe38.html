<h2>What's in Premium?</h2>

<p>In this lesson, Steve Houston demonstrates how to connect <strong>gesture</strong> and <strong>structure</strong> in figure drawing. He simplifies structure into <strong>corners</strong> that establish position and form, and gesture into <strong>long axis curves</strong> that bring life and energy. By combining curves and corners, you'll learn to create figures that are both dynamic and three-dimensional.</p>

<p>Steve applies these concepts by drawing with long axis curves, connecting forms even through interruptions, and emphasizing the importance of gesture over structure. He shares techniques for practicing effectively by focusing on one problem at a time, helping you improve with less frustration. The lesson also highlights maintaining a consistent thought process to progress through any medium and level of detail.</p>
