<p>When you think of perspective, you might imagine complicated grid lines like you're inside a 3D computer world. But you don't always need fancy perspective lines to indicate depth. You can use something much simpler called <strong>depth cues</strong>, and they're so simple, they're often overlooked. Let's go over six ways to indicate form and depth in your drawings.</p>

<p><strong>Overlap</strong></p>

<p>One of the most powerful ways to suggest that something is in front of something else is using <strong>overlap</strong>. When you overlap one object over another, it clearly shows which one is in front. For example, if you draw one elephant overlapping another, the one in front appears closer to the viewer. Switching the overlaps reverses the effect, making the other elephant appear in front. <strong>Overlap</strong> is a simple and foolproof way to suggest depth. It overrides all the other depth cues to communicate what is in front.</p>

<p><strong>Diminution</strong></p>

<p>But how come the elephant in the back looks like an adult when it's behind and a baby when it's in front? This brings us to the next depth cue: <strong>diminution</strong>. This means that things appear smaller as they go back into the distance. You've probably noticed this every day—people, cars, and objects that are far away look tiny. If you draw an elephant that's far away the same size as one that's close up, it looks like a giant. So, <strong>things in the distance get smaller</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Convergence</strong></p>

<p>How much smaller do they get? That's where <strong>convergence</strong> comes in. Objects get smaller and smaller until they reach a point called the <strong>vanishing point</strong>. <strong>Convergence</strong> means that parallel edges appear to angle toward this vanishing point as they recede into the distance. Even if there are no obvious parallel edges, convergence still applies.</p>

<p>For example, if you have a person standing close to you, they are a certain height. As they move away, their height converges toward the vanishing point. Their waistline and any other point along their body also converge toward the same point. The key idea is that you can fit anything into a box, and if you can converge a box's edges toward a vanishing point, you can apply convergence to anything.</p>

<p><strong>Foreshortening</strong></p>

<p><strong>Foreshortening</strong> is when objects angled toward you appear shorter in length. If you rotate a pencil toward you, it becomes shorter and shorter until it appears as a dot. You've become the vanishing point! <strong>Foreshortening</strong> occurs when things come forward toward you, and their length appears shorter.</p>

<p>The crazy thing is that with a 3D object, some part of it will always be foreshortened. On a box, the top appears much shorter than if you were looking at it straight down. When you look at someone's face from the front, the side plane appears as a very skinny piece—it's foreshortened. But when they turn their head, you see the entire length, and now the front plane is foreshortened. <strong>Boxes help us imagine the planes of any 3D object</strong> so you can foreshorten the planes going forward.</p>

<p>Those four depth cues are all aspects of <strong>linear perspective</strong>—depth that you can indicate with lines. The remaining two involve value or color.</p>

<p><strong>Atmospheric Perspective</strong></p>

<p><strong>Atmospheric perspective</strong> is the idea that things farther away have more atmosphere—particles of water or dust—between them and the viewer, which hides them. It makes distant objects appear as if they're receding into a fog. The farther they go into the fog, the harder it is to see them.</p>

<p>You can apply atmosphere to your lines by making lines that are farther away lighter. So, if you can apply atmosphere to your lines, doesn't that make it linear perspective? Well, yes. We can apply atmosphere to our lines, so it bridges between linear and tonal techniques.</p>

<p><strong>Rendering</strong></p>

<p>The next depth cue is called <strong>rendering</strong>. This is where you use the laws of light to shade and reveal the three-dimensional form of an object. It's purely tonal. You'll learn more about this in the "Values and Edges" section, where you'll explore how to use shading to create depth. I find this extremely fun, but let's focus on the first four depth cues for now.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p><strong>Overlap</strong>, <strong>Diminution</strong>, <strong>Convergence</strong>, and <strong>Foreshortening</strong> are powerful tools to create depth in your drawings. In the next lesson, you'll learn how to draw using one-point perspective. See you next time!</p>
