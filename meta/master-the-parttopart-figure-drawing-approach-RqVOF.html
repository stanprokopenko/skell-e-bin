<h2>Getting Started</h2>

<p>For this lesson's assignment, you will be given some figure references. You're now exploring the <strong>part-to-part approach</strong>, incorporating <strong>gesture</strong>, <strong>perspective</strong>, and working from <strong>head to foot</strong>.</p>

<h2>Embracing the Part-to-Part Approach</h2>

<p>When working on these drawings, make sure to have <strong>patience</strong> and <strong>grace</strong> with yourself. Don't be too hard on yourself, it's going to be <strong>uncomfortable at first</strong>, especially if you've been using the other approach. This is your chance to <strong>reorganize your thoughts</strong> and <strong>redevelop a new way</strong> of representing and organizing the same information you've been looking at.</p>

<h2>Tips for Success</h2>

<ul>

<li><strong>Treat it with levity</strong> and <strong>have fun</strong>.</li>

<li>If you're finding it difficult, try <strong>playing around with the exaggeration</strong> of the parts and <strong>modifying some forms</strong>. Experimenting with a little exaggeration might help you connect with the approach a bit more.</li>
