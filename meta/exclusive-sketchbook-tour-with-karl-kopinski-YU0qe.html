<p>Hey everyone! I had the pleasure of hosting Karl Kopinski in the studio, and while he was here, I made sure he did a sketchbook tour for us. He shared all new art that hasn't been published yet, and at the end, he showed us his new art book, <strong>"The Big Kopinski"</strong>. It was an inspiring experience, and I wanted to share some highlights with you.</p>

<h2>Exploring Karl's Sketchbooks</h2>

<p>Karl began by showing us one of his personal sketches that he just finished. He mentioned that he completes about <strong>five or six whole sketchbooks a year</strong>. He's been experimenting with Prismacolor and pencil crayons, influenced by <strong>Claire Wendling</strong>'s use of colored pencils. These mediums are great because they <strong>don't smudge as much</strong>, which is helpful since he's left-handed. Even so, you can see that he's a bit of a <strong>messy artist</strong>, which adds character to his work.</p>

<p>He shared a study he did for <strong>"Journey to the West"</strong>. As a kid, he loved a 1970s Japanese TV show about the <strong>Monkey King</strong>, and this has inspired some of his recent work.</p>

<p>Karl often creates pages filled with <strong>smaller studies</strong>, especially if a drawing isn't going as planned. He finds these pages fascinating because they contain a lot of ideas, allowing him to <strong>work through concepts quickly</strong> and play with heavier tones.</p>

<p>One of his pencil crayon sketches features a <strong>pig and a unicorn teddy</strong> with a <strong>Mickey Mouse belt buckle</strong>. It's these little details that draw you in and make his work so engaging.</p>

<h2>Diving into Military Studies</h2>

<p>He showed us a <strong>Napoleonic study piece</strong> he was working on. Karl has a strong interest in <strong>military history</strong> from his childhood. Without using reference, he's learned to draw helmets accurately, like German and US helmets, which have <strong>subtle lines</strong> that are challenging to capture. He enjoys this kind of technical drawing.</p>

<p>He admits he doesn't <strong>draw women enough</strong>, and sometimes when he does, they come out too <strong>masculine</strong>. He's been practicing to capture a more <strong>feminine touch</strong> without making the characters overly pouty.</p>

<p>We discussed teaching and how to <strong>break down complex images</strong> into simple composite elements. Karl shared some studies for the <strong>water demon</strong> in the Monkey King story, who has <strong>nine skulls from monks</strong>.</p>

<h2>Exploring Different Subjects</h2>

<p>Karl showed us <strong>wolf's head studies</strong> and mentioned that someone asked him to create <strong>tattoo designs</strong> in his style, which he found quite interesting.</p>

<p>He has a fascination with <strong>mecha</strong> and Japanese influences, though not directly. He explained his process of doing <strong>quick, loose lines</strong> to create armor shapes and interesting designs. Even if the shapes are unconventional, spending about an hour on a piece allows him to <strong>experiment</strong>. He believes this process is great for <strong>character design</strong>, especially in computer games where <strong>distinctive silhouettes</strong> are important.</p>

<p>He shared more sketches and doodles, including attempts at drawing <strong>sexy girls</strong>, <strong>astronauts</strong>, and other subjects he's fond of. He has a thing for astronauts and isn't entirely sure why.</p>

<p>One of his sketches was done with <strong>no underdrawing</strong>, just straight in with pen. He pointed out where he went wrong and had to use correction fluid, showing that even experienced artists <strong>make mistakes</strong>.</p>

<p>Karl often does demos on how to <strong>create authentic characters</strong> and teaches about the skull, lighting, and approaching various elements.</p>

<h2>Inspirations and Observations</h2>

<p>He drew his version of <strong>Obelix</strong> from the comics and shared a story about visiting <strong>Seville</strong> in Spain. After having the best Mexican food he's ever had, he was inspired to draw <strong>zombie mariachis</strong>. It's fascinating how simple experiences can spark creativity.</p>

<p>He sketches in airports and was quite happy with a girl he drew there with <strong>no underdrawing</strong>, just pencil crayon. He reflected on his time at Games Workshop, where he realized he was drawing the same face repeatedly. This led him to <strong>pay more attention to the diversity of faces</strong> around him.</p>

<p>Karl read about how the <strong>placement of features</strong> is more crucial than the fine details when recognizing someone. By observing the subtle differences in bone structure, even among people from the same country, he could capture more <strong>unique and authentic characters</strong>.</p>

<p>He drew a random <strong>pirate woman</strong> and was watching <strong>"Crimes of Grindelwald"</strong> on the plane, which inspired a sketch resembling <strong>Johnny Depp as a pirate</strong>.</p>

<h2>Experimenting with Concepts</h2>

<p>Karl likes playing with ideas like <strong>Batman</strong> in different eras, such as a <strong>First World War uniform</strong>. He once drew Batman with a <strong>Tommy gun</strong>, though fans reminded him that Batman doesn't use guns. He enjoys pushing these boundaries and exploring different interpretations.</p>

<p>He shared a sketch inspired by <strong>Moebius</strong>, a robot hunter salvaging robot parts. He enjoys when his work is influenced by other artists, but still retains his unique touch.</p>

<p>He showed studies for a bigger painting he did. Initially, the composition had a horse, but the client requested changes, and the final cover didn't include the horse.</p>

<p>He shared more astronaut sketches and mentioned one where the pose didn't turn out as he hoped. Nonetheless, it's all part of the <strong>creative process</strong>.</p>

<h2>Personal Touches</h2>

<p>Karl sketched <strong>Snape and Dobby</strong> from the Harry Potter series and drew <strong>goats</strong> after visiting a farm with his kids. He was amused by how fat their stomachs were and depicted them as big balls. One goat looks like it's wearing a jacket, giving it a <strong>hipster vibe</strong>.</p>

<p>He drew some kind of <strong>deer hunter</strong> and his son drawing on the iPad. There's also Batman <strong>taking a beating</strong>, and a piece inspired by a <strong>grueling cycling trip</strong> in Italy. He illustrated how he felt during that challenging ride.</p>

<p>He shared a sketch of <strong>space pirates</strong> and a <strong>mini bike race</strong>, where he particularly likes the punk rocker guy in front.</p>

<h2>Embracing Experimentation</h2>

<p>Karl enjoys creating <strong>mecha pieces</strong>, playing with shapes and ideas born out of early scribbles. He explained that many of these concepts are born from quick, loose lines and that the more time he spends on a piece, the more he can develop these ideas. He finds that this approach allows for more <strong>creativity and innovation</strong> in his designs.</p>

<p>He continues to fill up sketchbooks, showing us his next one that he's just started. It's always exciting to see what he'll come up with next.</p>

<h2>"The Big Kopinski" Art Book</h2>

<p>At the end, Karl introduced his first Superani book, <strong>"The Big Kopinski"</strong>. He produced a piece specifically for the cover, and included some pieces that hadn't been seen before. His dog <strong>Molly</strong> makes an appearance, and his son suggested adding a <strong>mouse on top of a bear's head</strong>, a fun collaborative touch.</p>

<p>The book collects a lot of his pencil sketches, including those he self-published in volumes one and two. These are now out of print. There's a big variety of subject matter, <strong>dragons</strong>, <strong>samurai rabbit hunters</strong>, <strong>pirates</strong>, <strong>Vikings</strong>, and more.</p>

<p>He shared some ink works he did for <strong>Inktober</strong>. He's still learning and experimenting with ink, and it's interesting to see his progress. He particularly likes one sketch where the character looks like she's genuinely engaged in an action, and she's sexy without being passive.</p>

<p>There are studies for a poster he did for <strong>Lucca Comics and Games</strong>, initial characters, and a nice color section at the back of the book.</p>

<p>He discussed some personal paintings, including one he sold but was a bit regretful about selling. He admitted he didn't like the wings in that painting and was glad he sold it in the end.</p>

<h2>Looking Ahead</h2>

<p>Karl has been playing with watercolors and did work for clients like <strong>Mini or Not</strong>, creating 26mm figurines for a board game. He enjoys projects where he's asked to do his take on techy bits.</p>

<p>Some of the last pieces he did digitally include fantasy <strong>Joker characters</strong>. He hasn't been doing much digital work lately but is interested in getting back into it, possibly using tools like <strong>Procreate</strong>. After seeing <strong>Katsuya Terada</strong>'s drawings on the iPad and the playback on Procreate, he's excited to explore it.</p>

<p>He showed a portrait of his wife as a gangster from <strong>"The Godfather"</strong> board game he did. There's more black and white work, including older drawings that are nice to look back on.</p>

<p>It was fantastic to have Karl share his sketchbooks and insights into his process. Flicking back through his work offers a reminder of his journey and the evolution of his art. There's always something new to learn and explore, and I hope you found his experiences as inspiring as I did.</p>
