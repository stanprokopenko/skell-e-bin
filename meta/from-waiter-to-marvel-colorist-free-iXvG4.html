<h2>What's in Premium?</h2>

<p>In the full lesson, I share my journey from a kid who loved coloring books to a professional comic book colorist with over 20 years of experience. I'll discuss how I broke into the industry, progressed from assisting to coloring entire issues, and found inspiration in nature during my travels. You'll learn about my favorite characters to color, how I handle self-doubt and burnout, and what keeps me motivated in this career.</p>
