<h2>What's in Premium?</h2>

<p>In this lesson, I share my journey from a novice to an artist at Watts Atelier. You'll learn about essential beginner exercises like drawing ovals, basic primitives, and value scales. We'll explore techniques for practicing Asaro heads to understand the planes of the face. I'll discuss the challenges of early figure drawings and how focusing on gestures over details improved my work. The lesson emphasizes the importance of practice, committing to shapes, and simplifying shadow and light to enhance your drawings. You'll gain insights into leveraging your unique strengths, embracing growth, and pushing beyond comfort zones to become the best version of yourself.</p>
