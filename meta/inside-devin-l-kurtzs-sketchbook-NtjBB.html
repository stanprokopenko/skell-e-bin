<p>I often get asked how I blend fantasy and reality so effortlessly in my work. The truth is, I fill sketchbooks with studies of the elements I incorporate into my paintings. Here's a look into my process. Maybe it can help you work through your ideas.</p>

<h2>My Practice Sketchbook</h2>

<p>This sketchbook is my <strong>practice zone</strong>. It's different from an art sketchbook where I'm trying to do finished pieces. This one is me <strong>studying</strong>. Most of the sketches are from reference, and I'm essentially trying to <strong>memorize the material</strong>. I'll draw right on top of other sketches. For example, I might do one page in pencil and then draw plants right over top.</p>

<h2>Studying from Life and Reference</h2>

<p>I have about <strong>40 house plants</strong>, so I'll draw them from life, but I also love to pull up <strong>Pinterest</strong> and draw them. There's a little bit of everything in here, <strong>motorcycles</strong>, <strong>bike helmets</strong>, <strong>keys</strong>, <strong>gloves</strong>, anything I could use for <strong>set dressing</strong>. I like to come up with shapes and draw <strong>many different versions of the same thing</strong>. I find that really appealing.</p>

<h2>Giving Objects Personality</h2>

<p>What kills a scene for me is when everything feels like a <strong>stock image version</strong> of an object. I never just want to draw a <strong>generic chair</strong>. I want the chair to have an <strong>attitude</strong>, a <strong>life it's lived beforehand</strong>, a <strong>history</strong>, and tell you something about the <strong>character</strong>. But to do that, I need to have enough chairs in my <strong>visual library</strong> to pull from different shapes.</p>

<h2>Using Online Resources</h2>

<p>I'll go on websites of furniture stores, especially when I'm drawing furniture. I'll visit a <strong>lamp store</strong> and draw <strong>50 different types of lamps</strong>. I love finding an Instagram account that's really into something, like someone who collects <strong>vintage tea sets</strong>. Their whole Instagram is just different vintage teacups, and stuff. **Gold mine! ** This is exactly what I want.</p>

<h2>Studying Animals</h2>

<p>I've got some <strong>cats</strong> here, and I noted the Instagram account I referenced them from. Then I've got <strong>frogs</strong>, I love frogs, they're my <strong>favorite animals</strong>. My favorites are <strong>poison dart frogs</strong>, they're so cool.</p>

<p>At the end of my sketchbook, I have some <strong>Shiba Inus</strong>. I have a Shiba Inu, so I'm very partial to them. One is saying, "I have never in my entire life done anything wrong," and another is saying, "I have," which I believe.</p>

<h2>Drawing Everyday Objects</h2>

<p>I love <strong>little objects</strong> in real life. My rooms are covered in little trinkets. So I've done sketches of <strong>glass bottles</strong>, more <strong>plants</strong>, and <strong>chairs</strong>. I love chairs. Chairs tell you so much about the <strong>characters</strong> who use them, especially in animated shows. If I'm designing a bedroom for a character, I like to give them a <strong>chair that means something</strong>.</p>

<p>Even with something as simple as a <strong>pillow</strong>, just throwing in one <strong>accent pillow</strong> into a couch gives so much <strong>personality</strong>. A <strong>bohemian pillow</strong> gives such a different impact for what character would have it versus a <strong>Victorian-looking pillow</strong>. You can do so much <strong>storytelling</strong> with what you put in an environment, so I like to have lots to pull from.</p>

<h2>Hands and Figure Studies</h2>

<p>I've got lots of studies from other artists too. These are all <strong>Milt Kahl hands</strong>. Anyone in the animation industry probably knows that Milt Kahl did so much <strong>emoting with hands</strong> in his work. I have a million studies of his hands.</p>

<p>Then I have some <strong>Tarzan hands</strong>, probably <strong>Glen Keane</strong>, and some other people too. There's so much <strong>weight</strong> in the hands. They did such a good job giving <strong>ape-like hand motions</strong> and the <strong>feet</strong> too, they are so good.</p>

<p>I also did some <strong>Studio Ghibli studies</strong>. I love their <strong>body language</strong> and the way they draw <strong>kids</strong>. I did these Studio Ghibli studies, then looked at some photos of actual <strong>toddlers</strong> and tried to pull in some of the <strong>face shapes</strong> and stuff into these studies.</p>

<h2>Working in Pen</h2>

<p>I do most of my studies in <strong>pen</strong>. I have some in pencil later because that's all I had with me at an event. But I love to do it in pen because <strong>if you mess up, great, whatever, just do the next one</strong>. It's very permanent, it makes me think about each line more. I don't like to be finicky about it. I like to just <strong>make a line and then live with it</strong>.</p>

<p>Sometimes I learn more about what <strong>mistakes</strong> I usually make if I leave the mistake on the page. If I look back over my mistakes, I can be like, "Oh, I'm making the wrists too lumpy," or whatever. I like that aspect of it, so that's why I always work in pen pretty much.</p>

<h2>Thumbnails and Concept Work</h2>

<p>Here's a thumbnail for a painting that I did, it's <strong>Katara with Momo</strong>. I love to do a pencil one first and then use pen over top to fix it, or sometimes I'll get <strong>wax paper</strong> and put that over top.</p>

<p>These are thumbnails from my book <strong>"The Bakery Dragon"</strong>. They're so rough, but you can see how basic my sketches are.</p>

<h2>Practicing Composition</h2>

<p>I made some groupings of objects from imagination. Once I feel confident in drawing the object, I like to create <strong>compositions</strong> with it. I take a group of them and try to compose different shapes, <strong>big and small</strong>, <strong>narrow and wide</strong>, <strong>square and round</strong>.</p>

<p>I want the page to look nice to me while I'm looking at it and working on it too, which I think is fun. I'll use the pen to create <strong>focal points</strong>, like a girl in the middle with a darker shade for her hair and a funny expression.</p>

<p>One thing I love about arranging objects is that you get <strong>practice knowing how much space a sketch is going to take up</strong> and being able to <strong>predict it</strong> and <strong>envision it on the page</strong>. You can see I don't always nail that, but you're practicing, getting <strong>mileage arranging objects</strong> next to each other, which obviously if you're working digitally doesn't matter, but if you're sketching traditionally, it's always nice to have that muscle.</p>

<h2>Compositional Tricks</h2>

<p>I think it's really about finding a balance between <strong>big, medium, and small shapes</strong>. <strong>Layering</strong> them in a way so there's not a ton of <strong>tension</strong> but also enough overlap that they feel like they <strong>sit next to each other naturally</strong>. <strong>Varying height and width</strong>, <strong>sharp versus round</strong>.</p>

<h2>Reptiles and Dragons</h2>

<p>This sketchbook is full of <strong>lizards</strong>. I always loved drawing lizards, but I was also practicing a lot because I have a <strong>dragon book series</strong>, so I'm drawing a lot of dragons. Lizards are very helpful for that.</p>

<p>I love doing these where you draw a head looking forward and then shift the angle down in all different directions. I feel like I learn so much about the <strong>face shapes</strong> and the <strong>head shapes</strong> and how to <strong>turn forms in space</strong> from doing that.</p>

<p>These are <strong>crested geckos</strong> that I've turned into dragons by lengthening the spikes on them, essentially just to make them look like dragons.</p>

<p>These are <strong>Komodo dragons</strong> and <strong>monitor lizards</strong>. They have such <strong>bulky, fun shapes</strong>. They're so weird looking, I love them so much. Their legs are so narrow for how wide their bodies are, and how big their heads are. You wouldn't think that, but that <strong>informs the way I draw dragons</strong> a lot. I love the look of that.</p>

<h2>Drawing Through Shapes</h2>

<p>Here I'm <strong>drawing through the shapes</strong>, trying to do <strong>form wireframing</strong> where I use lines to give myself an indication of what the forms are. I like drawing <strong>flat across a lot of planes</strong> and creating more of an <strong>angular, blocky look</strong> to it. It's easier to <strong>turn simpler forms in space</strong>, so to draw something from a bunch of angles from imagination, it's easier if you have simple shapes that you can map that onto.</p>

<h2>From Reference to Imagination</h2>

<p>These are from <strong>imagination</strong> where I was taking a lot of those shapes that I've been learning and <strong>posing</strong> them, putting them in different positions, adding <strong>expression</strong>, making them stand up and walk around and stuff like that.</p>

<h2>Studying Different Species</h2>

<p>I have <strong>bearded dragons</strong> - they are so floppy and wide, they're such funny little guys. Their legs are so narrow for how wide their bodies are, and how big their heads are.</p>

<p>These are <strong>leopard geckos</strong>. I had a leopard gecko as a pet when I was seven, and I love them. They have really strong <strong>eye lines</strong> that I think are so cool, and they feel so <strong>expressive</strong> to me. Look how <strong>sparkly</strong> their little eyes are. I get why the <strong>Geico gecko</strong> is so iconic, geckos make such a great little icon.</p>

<p>I drew <strong>sailfin lizards</strong>, they are gorgeous. They have so many different colors, and they have these <strong>soulful eyes</strong>. They feel so intelligent.</p>

<p><strong>Tuatara</strong> are like their own branch of the animal kingdom, they're so unique looking too. I love their little <strong>knobby elbows</strong>, their legs have such fun shapes.</p>

<h2>Leveraging Online Resources</h2>

<p>If you want to draw geckos, there's this website called <strong>Morph Market</strong>, where people sell their geckos and snakes and stuff like that. There are tons of pictures of geckos and all kinds of stuff you can use for reference.</p>

<h2>Practicing with Variety</h2>

<p>These are families based on <strong>family photos</strong>, lots of stuff for <strong>children's books</strong>. I really had to get used to drawing <strong>children</strong> because children's shapes are so different. Young children are so different from adults, and there's a real danger of drawing a <strong>little adult</strong>, which looks so weird.</p>

<h2>Form Wireframing and Shape Understanding</h2>

<p>I'm trying to do <strong>form wireframing</strong> here, using line to give myself an indication of what the forms are. I'm practicing <strong>drawing through the shapes</strong>, and that helps me understand how to <strong>turn them in space</strong>.</p>

<h2>Imagination and Repetition</h2>

<p>I'm pulling in all the things that I've learned over the course of doing all these studies. I start to pull it together and do some <strong>designs and fun posing</strong>, just feeling very <strong>fluid</strong> with my sketching. I think that's the best part of doing this, then I feel like I <strong>understand the shapes and the forms</strong>, and I can <strong>pose them however I want</strong> and <strong>turn them into whatever</strong>.</p>

<h2>Internalizing the Studies</h2>

<p>I rely on the <strong>muscle memory</strong> that I've worked on. I don't really look through my sketchbooks very often. I think it's more like I <strong>store it here</strong>, more than actually the drawings themselves.</p>

<h2>Experimenting with Color</h2>

<p>I've experimented with colored mediums like <strong>gouache</strong> and <strong>watercolor</strong>. I used to do watercolor sketchbooks. I haven't done that for a few years, but I would definitely go back to it. I think it's really fun to do color as well.</p>

<p>This sketchbook is really <strong>form-based</strong>, and as soon as I add color, I feel like I switch more into <strong>work mode</strong>. I need to practice <strong>staying out of work mode</strong> and being more <strong>experimental with color</strong>. When I'm doing this kind of thing, I really don't care whether it looks good, but once I start adding color, the <strong>caring switches on</strong>, and suddenly I have a harder time being okay with a sketch turning out bad. I know it's just another hurdle to get over because I don't want to care about that. I think <strong>color</strong> is such an integral part of my identity as an artist, but I think the only way to go through the emotional turmoil is to <strong>keep going</strong>, you know what I mean?</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p>I guess I'll show off this book because this is very tied to everything that I was studying in the sketchbook. This is a book all about a little <strong>dragon guy</strong>, and he needs to be able to <strong>walk around</strong>, be <strong>poseable</strong>. I wanted him to be able to <strong>emote</strong>, to do all kinds of <strong>fun motions</strong>, to feel like a lizard but also be highly mobile and able to emote through him.</p>

<p>I really needed that <strong>looseness</strong> and understanding of the <strong>shapes</strong> in order to be able to pose him with enough <strong>fluidity</strong>, and I felt like I could <strong>act through him</strong>. With storytelling, you want the characters to <strong>feel like characters</strong>. I didn't want him to feel like a <strong>lifeless lizard</strong>, I really wanted him to <strong>embody a human child but through a dragon</strong>. That's why I really wanted to become super familiar with lizard shapes, and feel like I had that fluidity. I pulled in all different lizard shapes for all these different dragons.</p>
