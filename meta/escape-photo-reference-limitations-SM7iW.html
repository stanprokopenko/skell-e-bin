<h2>Photographic Distortion</h2>

<p>Artists need to be cautious when drawing from photos due to <strong>photographic distortion</strong>. I wrote a book on this topic called "The Lion Eye." A camera lens has one eye, while humans have two, giving us <strong>binocular vision and depth perception</strong>. Cameras see in 2D, which can distort the perception of distance and size. For example, in a photo, an extended hand may appear much smaller than a foot, which can be misleading. When drawing from photos, avoid letting distortions affect your artwork, as viewers will notice inaccuracies.</p>

<h2>Drawing Techniques and Tips</h2>

<p>Focus on <strong>gestural structure</strong> when drawing, finding shapes and rhythms in the body. Here are some tips to improve your figure drawing:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Use pentimento</strong> (reworking lines) to refine shapes and proportions.</li>

<li><strong>Adjust head size</strong> to fit into the rib cage proportionally.</li>

<li><strong>Legs should be thicker</strong> at the top and taper towards the bottom.</li>

<li><strong>Err on the side of making legs longer</strong> rather than shorter for better visual appeal.</li>

<li><strong>Simplify hands</strong> in quick drawings, focusing on the overall shape before detailing fingers.</li>

<li>The <strong>scapula changes the appearance</strong> of the back, affecting how the arm and ribcage are drawn.</li>

<li><strong>Push drawing tools</strong> to their limits before switching to more permanent mediums like pencils.</li>

<li>The <strong>sight-size method</strong> is useful but can be pushed further for artistic style.</li>

<li><strong>Consistency in stylistic choices</strong> helps create a recognizable style.</li>

<li>Use <strong>pentimento</strong> to adjust and refine proportions, especially in areas like the ankle and foot.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Mnemonics for Figure Drawing</h2>

<p>Mnemonics can help remember complex concepts. For example, "Rhythm helps your two hips move." Use mnemonics to remember anatomical landmarks, like the <strong>high-waisted swimsuit shape for the sacrum</strong>.</p>

<h2>Personal Style and Artistic Growth</h2>

<p>Emphasize favorite anatomical features for personal style. For instance, the <strong>deltoid on female figures</strong> is less pronounced but still has a distinct shape. Emphasize what you love in your drawings to convey personal style and preferences. Sometimes draw what you know rather than what you see to correct distortions. Simplify anatomy for aesthetic purposes, especially in female figures. Consistency in stylistic choices helps create a recognizable style.</p>

<h2>Practical Advice for Drawing Practice</h2>

<ul>

<li><strong>Use short drawings</strong> to build skills and confidence, focusing on mileage over detailed rendering.</li>

<li><strong>Embrace mistakes</strong> as learning opportunities to improve future drawings.</li>

<li>Practice finding and emphasizing <strong>beautiful anatomical moments</strong>, like the rectus femoris.</li>

<li>Short drawings help develop skills faster than detailed renders.</li>

<li>In life drawing classes, <strong>focus on your work</strong> rather than comparing with others to avoid pressure.</li>

<li><strong>Kill the ego</strong> to improve focus and artistic growth.</li>

</ul>
