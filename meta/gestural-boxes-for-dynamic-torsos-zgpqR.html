<p>In this exercise, we're going to simplify torsos into boxes and then deform these boxes to follow the gesture of various poses. The goal is to capture the essence of the pose intuitively, without relying on precise measurements. This approach allows us to feel the planes rotating and moving, making the drawing process more dynamic and expressive.</p>

<h2>Intuitive Approach and Perspective</h2>

<p>We're focusing on using our intuition to feel the planes of the torso as they rotate and move. This means no rulers, no plotting points, and no vanishing points. Instead, we'll practice intuitive perspective, aiming to see how close we can get to a realistic representation by just feeling it out.</p>

<h2>Pose Breakdown</h2>

<h3>Pose 1</h3>

<p>For the first pose, the shoulders are clearly pointing at us, so we need to draw the top plane of the box facing the viewer. The torso curves down, and we're looking slightly up at the hips. Here's how I approached it:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Top Plane</strong>: Start with the top plane, following the curve of the shoulders.</li>

<li><strong>Curves and Exaggeration</strong>: Simplify the curves but don't deform too much to maintain the box shape.</li>

<li><strong>Hips</strong>: Capture the slight upward angle of the hips without showing too much of the bottom plane.</li>

<li><strong>Convergence</strong>: Ensure the sides converge properly to show foreshortening.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Pose 5</h3>

<p>In this pose, we're looking up at the torso, which is foreshortened and has a subtle twist. Here's the breakdown:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Shoulders</strong>: The shoulders angle slightly downward.</li>

<li><strong>Twist and Curve</strong>: There's a subtle S-curve, which I exaggerated slightly for a more gestural feel.</li>

<li><strong>Convergence</strong>: Make sure the sides converge to show depth.</li>

<li><strong>Cross Contours</strong>: Add cross contours to describe the form.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Pose 6</h3>

<p>This pose has some camera distortion, making the hips look smaller compared to the rib cage. We're looking down at the torso:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Hips</strong>: Start with the hips, which are clearer in this pose.</li>

<li><strong>Side Plane</strong>: Capture the subtle downward angle and the side plane.</li>

<li><strong>S-Curve</strong>: Use an S-curve to show the motion.</li>

<li><strong>Clean Lines</strong>: Keep the lines clean and accurate.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Pose 10</h3>

<p>This pose is a side view with extreme foreshortening. We're interpreting the twist and front plane visibility:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Angle</strong>: Start with the angle of the shoulders.</li>

<li><strong>Convergence</strong>: Show significant convergence to capture the close-up perspective.</li>

<li><strong>Front Plane</strong>: Decide how much of the front plane to show.</li>

<li><strong>Interpretation</strong>: Simplify and exaggerate the shapes as needed.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Pose 13</h3>

<p>This pose has an extreme upward angle with a clear S-curve and pinch:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Shoulders</strong>: The shoulders angle upward.</li>

<li><strong>S-Curve</strong>: Capture the S-curve and the pinch in the gesture.</li>

<li><strong>Bloating</strong>: Bloat the back and other parts to conform to the gesture.</li>

<li><strong>Structure</strong>: Ensure the structure aligns with the gesture.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Pose 16</h3>

<p>In this pose, we're looking down at the shoulders, which are curving back slightly:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Top Plane</strong>: Flatten the top plane to avoid showing too much of it.</li>

<li><strong>Side Plane</strong>: Capture the side plane accurately.</li>

<li><strong>Line Weight</strong>: Use line weight to emphasize important lines and show depth.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Pose 18</h3>

<p>This pose has an extreme twist, showing both the front and back of the torso:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Separation</strong>: Separate the torso into two boxes, one for the rib cage and one for the hips.</li>

<li><strong>Convergence</strong>: Ensure proper convergence to show depth.</li>

<li><strong>Line Weight and Cross-Contours</strong>: Use line weight and cross-contours to describe the form and movement.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Observations and Critiques</h2>

<p>Throughout the process, I made self-critiques and adjustments for each pose. It's important to capture the angles and planes accurately while balancing exaggeration and simplification. Here are some key points:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Angles</strong>: Pay attention to the angles of the shoulders and hips.</li>

<li><strong>Exaggeration</strong>: Exaggerate the curves and twists to enhance the gesture.</li>

<li><strong>Simplification</strong>: Simplify the shapes to maintain the box structure.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Importance of Line Weight and Cross-Contours</h2>

<p>Using line weight is crucial to show depth and plane changes. Thicker lines can bring certain parts forward, while thinner lines can push parts back. Cross-contours help describe the form and movement, adding more depth to the drawing.</p>

<h2>Final Thoughts and Encouragement</h2>

<p>Interpreting the human body through this exercise is a great way to balance gesture and structure. It's a fun and dynamic process that brings together everything we've learned so far. Keep practicing and applying these concepts to improve your intuitive perspective and drawing skills. See you in the next session for critiques!</p>
