<h2>Available Resources</h2>

<p>In the downloads section, you'll find <strong>inked pages</strong> ready for you to flat and color. You'll have access to inked <strong>interior pages from various comics</strong>, as well as several <strong>covers and splash pages</strong>. There's a wide variety of <strong>art styles and storytelling approaches</strong> in this collection, so you may need to approach coloring different artists' work differently.</p>

<h2>Approaching Different Art Styles</h2>

<p>Think about how your coloring can:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Add more emotional impact</strong> to the pages</li>

<li><strong>Make the action clearer</strong></li>

<li><strong>Show off the three-dimensional forms</strong> of the characters and environments</li>

</ul>

<p>Keep in mind:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Character and location color schemes</strong></li>

<li><strong>Time of day</strong> or other <strong>environmental lighting</strong></li>

<li><strong>Mood</strong> and dramatic <strong>flourishes of color</strong></li>

</ul>

<h2>Tools and Techniques</h2>

<p>Any digital tool will work, but you'll want to use a program that has <strong>layers and layer styles</strong>. Follow Matt's coloring process:</p>

<ol>

<li><strong>Flat your pages first</strong> before locking in the local colors.</li>

<li>Then add <strong>shading</strong>, <strong>highlights</strong>, and <strong>finishing touches</strong>.</li>

</ol>

<p>Some of the more graphic pages may not need as much shading as some of the more realistically drawn pages.</p>

<h2>Using Color Effectively</h2>

<p>Look for ways to use color to:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Showcase depth and volume</strong></li>

<li><strong>Focus attention</strong></li>

<li><strong>Enhance the readability</strong> of the page</li>

</ul>

<p>Make sure the <strong>color palette</strong> and <strong>rendering style</strong> you choose <strong>complements the look and feel of the line art</strong> instead of overwhelming it.</p>

<h2>Your Assignment</h2>

<p>Fully color <strong>one comic interior</strong> and <strong>one cover or splash page</strong>. Once you've finished, take <strong>one panel from your interior color</strong> and <strong>change the time of day</strong>!</p>

<p>That's the minimum though. If you're serious about making comic art, you'll do more than just that. We have a lot of great art to choose from, and there are a few <strong>bonus pages</strong> that will really challenge you if you dare to take them on.</p>

<h2>Submission Guidelines</h2>

<p>When you submit your assignments, include:</p>

<ul>

<li>The <strong>flats</strong></li>

<li>A page showing your <strong>base colors</strong></li>

<li>The <strong>finished piece</strong></li>

</ul>

<p>Include a <strong>layered TIFF file</strong> so we can turn the layers on and off, and give proper feedback. Assume you're handing your page in to an editor. Your pages should be <strong>ready to print in a comic</strong>! Don't just paint bucket on the ink layer, use Matt's step-by-step approach to make a masterful color page.</p>
