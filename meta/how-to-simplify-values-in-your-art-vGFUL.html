<p>This project will help you <strong>see value relationships</strong> and <strong>organize them into groups</strong>. You'll start by simplifying images down to just <strong>two or three values</strong>, and later, you'll add more. The goal is to practice looking at an image and squeezing those values into simplified groups.</p>

<h2>Two-Value Simplification (Notan Drawing)</h2>

<p>A <strong>two-value drawing</strong> is known as a <strong>Notan drawing</strong> (also humorously referred to as "Notan Stan" by my wife). When using just two values, you have your <strong>lights</strong> and <strong>darks</strong>.</p>

<p>In reality, you see many more values, but you need to choose a <strong>threshold</strong>. Anything lighter than this point goes into the lights, anything darker goes into the darks. Where you set this threshold is up to you, it should be somewhere in the middle but it's based on your perception and feeling when you look at the image.</p>

<h3>Threshold Selection in Notan Drawings</h3>

<p>Deciding where to place the threshold is crucial. You get to decide where you put that border between light and dark. It's a simplification, so you have the artistic freedom to choose how you want to represent the values in your drawing.</p>

<h2>Three-Value Simplification</h2>

<p>When working with <strong>three values</strong>, you gain an additional <strong>mid value</strong> to help you out. This can actually make the process easier. Now you have:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Lights</strong></li>

<li><strong>Mid values</strong></li>

<li><strong>Shadows (darks)</strong></li>

</ul>

<p>The mid value acts as a container for all those ambiguous values that could go either way in a two-value drawing. It's very handy and provides 50% more information with just one additional value.</p>

<p>However, don't overuse the mid value by throwing too much into it. Try to make a clear distinction between light and shadow, and only put values that are clearly in the middle into the mid value.</p>

<h3>Setting Thresholds with Three Values</h3>

<p>With three values, you now have <strong>two thresholds</strong>:</p>

<ol>

<li>At what point is a value considered <strong>light</strong> or <strong>mid</strong>?</li>

<li>At what point is a value considered <strong>mid</strong> or <strong>dark</strong>?</li>

</ol>

<p>While it's slightly more complex, having these two decisions can make the simplification process easier because you have less problem-solving to do compared to only working with two values.</p>

<h2>Thumbnail Studies of Master Paintings</h2>

<p>In the downloads, you'll find several images of <strong>master paintings</strong>. Your assignment is to do <strong>thumbnail studies</strong> of these paintings, focusing on the <strong>values</strong>. Your goal is to study how the masters are organizing their major value groups.</p>

<p>Feel free to use the images provided or choose a master you want to study. Just remember that some paintings might be difficult to break into just two values. Any image can be simplified to two values, but sometimes, that third value (the mid value) is very handy to capture the essence of the composition.</p>

<h2>Level One Assignment</h2>

<h3>Creating Two- and Three-Value Thumbnails</h3>

<ol>

<li><strong>Select an image</strong> from the provided master paintings or choose one on your own.</li>

<li><strong>Simplify</strong> the image into <strong>two or three values</strong>.<ul>

<li>For two values, focus on distinguishing lights and darks.</li>

<li>For three values, include mid values for ambiguous areas.</li>

</ul>

</li>

<li><strong>Determine thresholds</strong> for where values transition between light, mid, and dark.</li>

<li><strong>Create thumbnail sketches</strong> focusing on the major shapes and value groups.</li>

</ol>

<h3>Thumbnail Drawing Basics</h3>

<p>A <strong>thumbnail</strong> is a smaller drawing, ranging from one inch to about five or six inches. Making them small forces you to avoid details, you simply don't have room for them. This encourages you to think about the <strong>major shapes</strong> and <strong>value groups</strong>.</p>

<h3>Inspiration from Charles Bargue</h3>

<p>If you're familiar with <strong>Charles Bargue</strong>, his work is a great inspiration for this project. In his drawing course, he simplifies figures into two values, removing all the details. Although his drawings are not thumbnails, they focus on the same simplification we're practicing here.</p>

<h2>Level Two Assignment</h2>

<p>For those looking for an extra challenge, Level Two involves:</p>

<ol>

<li>

<p><strong>Setting up your own still life</strong>:</p>

<ul>

<li>Compose and arrange objects of your choice.</li>

<li><strong>Light</strong> the still life to create interesting value contrasts.</li>

<li><strong>Photograph</strong> your setup to work from.</li>

</ul>

</li>

<li>

<p><strong>Simplifying your own image</strong>:</p>

<ul>

<li>Create two- and three-value thumbnails from your photograph.</li>

</ul>

</li>

</ol>

<h3>Setting Up Your Own Still Life</h3>

<p>Setting up your own still life can be as simple or complex as you like. You might arrange some fruits in a basket or any objects that interest you. The key is to have large forms and clear lighting to make your value study effective.</p>

<h3>Challenges of Working from Photographs</h3>

<p>Working from photographs is more challenging than working from master paintings because:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Photographs contain all the raw details and noise</strong>.</li>

<li>You have to do all the <strong>filtering and simplifying yourself</strong>.</li>

<li>Your inclination might be to include all the little details you see.</li>

</ul>

<p>Fight the urge to include details. Focus on <strong>big, massive groups of shapes</strong> and simplify them into two or three values.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p>Remember, the assignment is not about creating beautiful drawings. It's about improving specific skills, seeing and organizing values, so that when you work on your finished pieces, these skills come together to enhance your art.</p>

<p>Good luck with your studies! Up next, I'll be doing demos to guide you further.</p>
