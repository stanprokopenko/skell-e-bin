<h2>What's in Premium?</h2>

<p>In this premium lesson, you'll learn how to use the <strong>picture plane</strong> to solve perspective drawing problems. We'll explain how it acts as a window into perspective, helping you understand why <strong>closer objects appear larger</strong> and <strong>distant objects appear smaller</strong>. You'll explore the differences between <strong>one-point</strong> and <strong>two-point perspective</strong>, and learn how to find <strong>vanishing points</strong> using the picture plane. We'll guide you through the <strong>plan and projection method</strong> to accurately draw three-dimensional objects from orthographic views, and show you how to <strong>align heights</strong> to complete your perspective drawings.</p>
