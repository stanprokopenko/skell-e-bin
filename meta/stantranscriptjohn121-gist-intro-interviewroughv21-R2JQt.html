<h2>My Favorite Covers</h2>

<p>Hi, my name is Eric Gist, though you'll often see me credited as <strong>EMGIST</strong>. I've worked on a lot of different stuff, but some of my favorite covers are the ones I did for <strong>Fantastic Four</strong> and <strong>Iron Fist</strong>. I've also done covers for <strong>Wolverine</strong> and <strong>Hulk</strong>, among others.</p>

<p>Choosing a favorite is tough because I like them for different reasons. My <strong>Hulk</strong> cover was really cool because it was an action scene—a classic fight between Wolverine and Hulk, which I think almost every comic artist wants to do at some point. Plus, it featured a zombie Wolverine, which was pretty cool since I'm kind of known for doing zombies.</p>

<p>The <strong>Fantastic Four</strong> cover was a lot of fun because there was more storytelling involved. With more characters, each with their own characteristics, and the whole family dynamic, it was a good challenge to work that into a single image. It's something I really enjoy.</p>

<h2>Getting Started in Comics</h2>

<p>My first cover was back in 2007, so it's been a while—about 15 years now. I started working for Marvel around <strong>2016</strong>. My first work for them was a series of covers for the <strong>Haunted Mansion</strong> series. Then my first real Marvel character cover was for the anniversary issue of <strong>Crazy</strong> in <strong>2019</strong>.</p>

<p>I've always wanted to draw comic books. I've been into comics since I was a little kid—probably around eight years old. I wanted to do interiors at first, but I was terrible. I did submissions every month to all the companies and got tons of rejection letters—some of which I still have.</p>

<p>Then I started training with <strong>Jeff Watts</strong>, and I found out that I had more of a knack for single image storytelling. I still loved the genre of comics, but I wanted to get more into painting and covers. So, I started pursuing that, and it took me about ten years to get good enough, and then another five to catch on doing them.</p>

<p>I got into comics by taking my stuff to Comic-Con. I started by showing interior samples but realized I had more of a knack for cover art. Doing painted interiors is tough—not many artists do it—and the ones who do are just amazing. I've only done covers for comics, but I've also done some <strong>card illustrations</strong>, which are similar to doing covers.</p>

<h2>My Artistic Style</h2>

<p>Broadly speaking, my style is often dictated by how I feel about the characters—not in terms of liking or disliking them, but more about capturing their essence. I'm known for <strong>deep shadows</strong>, <strong>high contrast</strong>, and creating a <strong>moodier</strong>, <strong>noir</strong>, or even <strong>horror</strong> feel in my work.</p>

<p>In the last year or two, I've been branching out into some brighter colored stuff, especially when working with brighter characters like the <strong>Fantastic Four</strong> and <strong>Iron Fist</strong>. With the Fantastic Four, I went in a sort of <strong>Norman Rockwell</strong> direction—he's one of my favorite artists of all time. For the Iron Fist cover, I took a brighter approach, showing the history of the character and the literal passing of the torch.</p>

<p>I don't want to get stuck doing the same thing over and over again. I want to be one of those artists who gets asked to do just about everything.</p>

<h2>Influences and Inspiration</h2>

<p>There are a lot of artists I admire, especially from the past, but also many working today. I'm particularly drawn to artists who balance an <strong>iconic image</strong> with storytelling. Your initial read on their work is something you'll never forget—an image that's burned into your mind. That's the kind of painting I want to make—<strong>something that sticks with you day after day</strong>.</p>

<h2>Should You Specialize or Be Well-Rounded?</h2>

<p>That's a tough question, but I definitely think you should <strong>specialize</strong> at first. Get really, really good at one thing. You'll be better off than being mediocre at three different things. Once you feel like you've got a good handle on it, you can start to branch out.</p>

<p>Comics seem to be heading in the direction of the well-rounded artist. When I was a kid, there were pencilers, inkers, and colorists—each with their own specialty. Now, those lines are getting blurrier. Art directors and editors like to see someone who can do it all.</p>

<p>It's good to know a little bit of everything—<strong>be a jack of all trades, master of one</strong>. That way, when you're communicating with your inker, colorist, or writer, you come from a standpoint of knowledge, not ignorance.</p>

<h2>Improving Cover Art Skills</h2>

<h3>Study the Masters</h3>

<p>To get better at making covers, study the people who are good at it. Don't limit yourself to contemporary artists. Go back to cover artists throughout the long history of illustration—not just comic cover artists. Look at narrative painters from before print, like <strong>Bouguereau</strong>, <strong>Caravaggio</strong>, and <strong>Rembrandt</strong>. I often look at their work as much or more than artists working today.</p>

<p>I think it's one of the things that sets my work apart—it has a sort of timeless feel. That's what I strive for with my artwork. I don't want it to feel trendy or modern, but at the same time, I don't want it to feel dated. I aim for that "it never looked new but never gets old" type of feel.</p>

<h3>Work on Your Fundamentals</h3>

<p>Your <strong>fundamentals</strong> are crucial. That includes figure drawing, basic drawing, fundamental forms, lighting, anatomy, color theory, perspective, and composition. In comics, the figure is obviously more important because it's about people first and foremost. If you can draw a <strong>cool, dynamic figure</strong>, you can get away with a lot in other areas.</p>

<p>Composition is also key—taking the figure and putting it into an interesting composition. Be good enough at the other things that people don't notice flaws. That can be very distracting. But your figure and composition are where you can really shine.</p>

<h3>Practice by Making Covers</h3>

<p>If you want to get better at making covers, <strong>make covers</strong>. Do a lot of them. Make some bad covers—get them out of your system. That's how you're going to get better.</p>

<p>But remember, that's still going to be built on good, solid fundamentals. Find someplace where you can learn that. <strong>Proko</strong> is a great place for learning your fundamentals. Study hard, have a wide variety of influences, and make covers.</p>

<h2>Embracing Limitations</h2>

<p>You might think it's limiting to try and fit as much of a story as you can into one image, but I find limitations to be a good thing. They make you be clever. They make you think through a problem and come up with an interesting solution.</p>

<p>It's like in some of my favorite movies from when I was a kid, like <strong>Alien</strong>. Because of the limitations in special effects, they had to hide the alien in shadows, which made it scarier and more compelling. Limitations can breed creativity because you have to find a way around them. The more you have to dig deeper, the more original you're likely to be.</p>

<h2>The Importance of Thumbnails</h2>

<p>Thumbnails are such an important part of the process. A friend of mine once said that <strong>the first five thumbnails you do are always someone else's idea</strong>. You have to get to about the tenth sketch before you start getting into something that's unique to you.</p>

<p>In my own process, I might do five thumbnails that are someone else's idea without realizing it, and then another five that are bad ideas. It's important not to limit yourself to just your first idea. As you gain experience, you might start skipping over those initial ideas because you've learned they're not as compelling.</p>

<h2>Advice to Aspiring Artists</h2>

<h3>Don't Force Style</h3>

<p>There's nothing I would say to avoid studying. There's no such thing as bad knowledge or bad influences. It's all about how you're going to use them.</p>

<p>However, I would advise against <strong>forcing style</strong>. Don't try too much to be someone else. Have your influences, but let them find their way into your work organically. Don't force it, because that can end up feeling false and making you a second-rate version of another artist.</p>

<h3>Be Yourself</h3>

<p>The biggest thing is to <strong>be yourself</strong>. Let your style emerge naturally. The best way to be yourself is to not be other people. It's good to be familiar with a wide range of influences, but ultimately, you want your work to reflect who you are.</p>

<h2>What I Wish I Knew Earlier</h2>

<p>I started doing comic covers when I already had quite a bit of knowledge and experience under my belt. I'd worked in video games for about five years and done illustration in other areas for about five years.</p>

<p>I wish I knew <strong>how good you have to be</strong>. Each level you go up, especially in comics, there's a tier system. You start off working for third or fourth-tier companies, and it's not that those companies aren't good or that you're not doing good work, but you're not in front of as broad a populace.</p>

<p>I was 17 or 18 when I was doing pages and submitting them to Marvel, DC, and Image, which was ridiculous looking back. But I didn't know any better, and it didn't hurt—it kept me motivated and producing work. Here I am, 20 or 30 years later, doing covers, and I still look at my work and sometimes think, "I wish that was better."</p>

<p>Your job is to <strong>sell comics</strong>. For me, my job is to do a good image, but for the company you're working for, it's about selling books. You have to be able to sell books, and you want to make sure you're good enough to sell books.</p>

<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>I want to create images that stand out in people's minds—something that sticks with them. There are so many great artists out there, both past and present. I strive to balance an iconic image with storytelling, creating something that stands the test of time.</p>

<p>Remember to work on your fundamentals, study a wide range of artists, and keep making covers. Embrace limitations—they can breed creativity. Don't force your style; let it emerge naturally. And most importantly, <strong>be yourself</strong>.</p>
