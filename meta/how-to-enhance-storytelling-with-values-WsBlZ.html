<p>An artist's job isn't about capturing all the details, it's about <strong>interpreting</strong>, <strong>summarizing</strong>, and <strong>distilling</strong> with an <strong>opinion</strong>. The images you create communicate with viewers, and strong compositions get the message across clearly.</p>

<h2>Value Range</h2>

<p>Most drawings and paintings use a <strong>full value range</strong>, from white to black, giving you maximum contrast. But you don't have to use every value. You can use a <strong>limited value range</strong>, focusing on:</p>

<ul>

<li>Just the dark half of the scale</li>

<li>Just the light half</li>

<li>Only middle values</li>

</ul>

<p>Limiting your value range can greatly affect the <strong>mood</strong> of your artwork. For instance, using middle values enhances color intensity, as adding black or white reduces chroma.</p>

<p>You can also limit which values you use within that range. Splitting a range into sections and using only specific values opens up creative possibilities. Your decisions can have a big impact on the overall feel of your picture and can be an important part of your style.</p>

<p><strong>Identifying Extremes</strong> is crucial. Find the lightest lights and darkest darks in your picture. Knowing these extremes provides reference points to judge other values.</p>

<h2>Value Keys</h2>

<p>Value keys relate to how you <strong>distribute values</strong> within your range. Even with a full range, how much you use of each value matters.</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Low Key</strong> - Dominated by darker values, feels dramatic or mysterious.</li>

<li><strong>High Key</strong> - Dominated by lighter values, feels airy, open, or calm.</li>

<li><strong>Mid Key</strong>: Balanced distribution or heavy on mid-tones</li>

</ul>

<p>Adjust the values to support your story and resonate with the subject matter.</p>

<p>A useful trick is to use a <strong>rare high-contrast value</strong> to draw attention. In a low key painting, a few very light shapes will stand out and grab the viewer's eye.</p>

<h2>Value Hierarchy</h2>

<p>By managing <strong>value relationships</strong>, you create a hierarchy that guides the viewer's eye through your composition. Decide what's most important:</p>

<ul>

<li>Emphasize the object as a whole</li>

<li>Highlight the contrast between light and shadow</li>

</ul>

<p>You can change your reference to suit your needs, increasing contrast in key areas or simplifying others. Avoid spotty values that break unity, related areas should share related values.</p>

<h2>Analyzing Masterworks</h2>

<p>Studying masters helps you understand value. In <strong>NC Wyeth's</strong> painting, the histogram reveals four distinct value groups that separate main objects and create depth. Deliberate choices in value grouping enhance clarity and depth.</p>

<h2>Experiment and Practice</h2>

<p>Experiment with different value distributions in the same scene. See how it changes the <strong>feeling</strong>, <strong>focus</strong>, and <strong>story</strong>. Don't be afraid to push extremes or try subtle variations that speak to your artistic voice. Keep doing master studies to deepen your understanding.</p>
