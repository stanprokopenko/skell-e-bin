<h2>Common Struggles of Beginners</h2>

<p>When you're just starting out, it's easy to get overwhelmed. I've noticed that beginners often struggle with keeping the <strong>focus of each panel</strong> in mind. It's important to make the panel or page dynamic, while guiding the reader towards that focal point. Sometimes, new artists get too caught up in other aspects, perhaps because they're adjusting to a new job or the demands of a professional career.</p>

<p>What ends up happening is they might neglect the most important elements of the page or panel. This can result in artwork that looks <strong>flat and lacks depth</strong>. For example, they might not push the foreground and background elements far enough apart to create a more interesting image. Even when working with flat colors, it's crucial to <strong>separate the planes</strong> effectively to avoid a boring and non-dynamic look.</p>

<p>I've been there myself. Looking back at my old work, I recall missing opportunities where I could have made an image more interesting.</p>

<h2>The Importance of Study and Practice</h2>

<p>You need to be <strong>studying color theory</strong>, looking at other comics, studying other artworks, and observing nature around you. In parallel, you need to be <strong>in the seat and coloring a lot</strong>. That's the only way you're going to get better and faster, both of which are important when dealing with production work on a deadline.</p>

<h2>Overcoming the Fear of Failure</h2>

<p>For me, what holds me back even today is this weird hang-up about wanting to <strong>get it right on the first try</strong>, which translates into a fear of failure. I remember when I was in college, I'd look at comics and think, "Oh wow, look at all those little white marks in the black spaces." I tried to replicate that by leaving white marks there, not realizing that artists were using whiteout to create those effects.</p>

<p>It didn't occur to me until years later, when I saw original art at a convention, that mistakes and corrections were part of the process. So, I would say to anyone starting out: <strong>Just experiment</strong>. Put a million marks down. <strong>Color a page five different ways</strong> if you have the time. <strong>Don't be afraid to fail</strong>, and don't think you have to get it right on the first try. These were some of the stumbling blocks for me.</p>

<h2>Finding Your Own Pace</h2>

<p>It's funny because among professional colorists, there's a wide range of working speeds. I like to average <strong>five pages a day</strong>, and that's a decent day for me. Some successful colorists might do two pages a day, while others might do more than five. Everyone has a different approach and life circumstances that affect their work pace.</p>

<p>But who cares? <strong>It's the end product that matters</strong>. I think <strong>three to five pages</strong> is a good range. Even if you're coloring the simplest comic, you're still going to spend all day on a page when you're starting out. You'll be unsure, not know what you want to do, make mistakes, and it might take forever to fix them. But that's why you keep coloring. You get better, you get past all that, and then <strong>speed comes</strong>.</p>

<h2>Dealing with Creative Blocks</h2>

<p>Some days, I'm just not feeling it. This is my job, and it has been for a long time, but it's still a <strong>creative endeavor</strong>. Some days, you sit down, and that spark isn't there. You don't like any palette you're coming up with, and it's a struggle. On days like that, I might only do <strong>two pages</strong>.</p>

<p>Sometimes, you need to <strong>disconnect from the work and refresh</strong> because that's the only way you're going to kick back into gear. But some days, you just have to <strong>work through it</strong>. When there's a deadline, not hitting it is only going to hurt you because then you're not going to get hired again. So, sometimes you have to figure out a way to push through.</p>

<h2>Embracing New Tools and Techniques</h2>

<p>The introduction of tools like <strong>Kyle Webster brushes</strong>, now incorporated into Adobe Photoshop and other programs, has changed a lot. I can think back to different eras in my work, starting with mouse and keyboard, making selections and gradients, then using rudimentary brushes like stamps, and now having <strong>sophisticated custom brushes</strong>.</p>

<p>It's nice to have the freedom to simulate laying a brush on canvas and achieve that organic result. I appreciate how far digital tools have come. I've <strong>specialized in a few tools</strong>, and it's served me well. But don't be afraid to <strong>learn and specialize in a few more tools</strong>, and then even more after that.</p>

<h2>Stepping Outside Your Comfort Zone</h2>

<p>I've tried my hand at other things besides comic coloring, side gigs, collaborations, projects outside of comics. The thing I always notice is I'll run into a frustration or struggle, and be immediately transported back to when I was first starting coloring. It's a revelation, because I remember what it was like being new at something.</p>

<p>When I've pushed through and produced something outside of comics, it's been such a rewarding feeling. So, <strong>don't limit yourself</strong>. <strong>Try as many tools as you're interested in</strong>. Pushing through new learning experiences can bring a lot of satisfaction.</p>

<h2>Managing Your Learning Pace</h2>

<p>I think a lot now is geared towards producing things quickly, posting on social media and responding promptly. I would try not to let the pace of modern life dictate your pace of learning. <strong>Take as much time as you need</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Specialize in a few things</strong> that allow you to produce the best art possible. Then, get good enough at a few fringe things that can <strong>supplement your main skills</strong>. Don't rush your learning process.</p>

<h2>Learning from Others</h2>

<p>Pay attention to <strong>what you like and why you like it</strong>. When I was really devouring a lot of work to try and get better, I looked at other comic book colorists, not to copy them exactly, but to understand. If I loved a sunset scene, I would think about why I liked it. I'd look at the color and value of the sky next to the far-off horizon, next to the plane where all the characters are standing.</p>

<p>Any scene I responded to, I would then look at and really understand why I responded to it. So, the next time I came to color a sunset, I'd have all that in mind, but I wouldn't necessarily be trying to <strong>recreate the exact color palette</strong>. It's heavily dependent on your interests and influences.</p>
