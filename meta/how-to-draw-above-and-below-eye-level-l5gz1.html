<p>When drawing in perspective, one of the first elements you establish is the <strong>viewerâ€™s eye level</strong>, also known as the <strong>horizon line</strong>. This line determines the point of view and affects how other lines in your drawing will behave, especially when depicting views from <strong>above</strong> or <strong>below</strong>.</p>

<h2>The Horizon Line and Eye Level</h2>

<h3>Choosing the Horizon Line</h3>

<p>The <strong>horizon line</strong> represents the viewer's eye level and is crucial in determining the <strong>perspective</strong> of the drawing. By choosing the height of the horizon line, you set the stage for how objects will appear in relation to the viewer.</p>

<h3>How Eye Level Affects Perspective</h3>

<p>Once you've established the eye level, it influences the angles and directions of the other lines in your drawing. Objects above the eye level will show their <strong>undersides</strong>, while objects below will show their <strong>tops</strong>. Adjusting the eye level changes the viewer's perception of the scene.</p>

<h2>Aiming Receding Lines</h2>

<h3>Lines Aiming Up and Down</h3>

<p>In perspective drawing, there are typically <strong>three sets of lines</strong>:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>X-axis lines</strong> (horizontal)</li>

<li><strong>Y-axis lines</strong> (vertical)</li>

<li><strong>Z-axis lines</strong> (depth)</li>

</ul>

<p>When <strong>receding lines</strong> (lines representing depth) <strong>aim up</strong> as they go away from the viewer, it indicates that the object is <strong>below</strong> us. Conversely, when these lines <strong>aim down</strong>, the object is <strong>above</strong> us.</p>

<p><strong>Remember:</strong></p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Looking down</strong>, lines go <strong>up</strong> (Z and X axes).</li>

<li><strong>Looking up</strong>, lines go <strong>down</strong> (X and Z axes).</li>

</ul>

<h3>Understanding Above and Below Views</h3>

<p>By thinking in terms of how lines aim in relation to the eye level, you can intuitively place objects <strong>above</strong> or <strong>below</strong> the viewer. This approach helps when starting a sketch, even without precisely knowing the vanishing points.</p>

<h2>Vanishing Points in Perspective</h2>

<h3>One-Point and Two-Point Perspective</h3>

<ul>

<li>In <strong>one-point perspective</strong>, one set of lines (typically the depth lines) converges to a single vanishing point.</li>

<li>In <strong>two-point perspective</strong>, two sets of lines (often width and depth) recede toward two separate vanishing points.</li>

</ul>

<p>The vertical lines in both cases remain <strong>parallel</strong> and do not converge, as they are <strong>perpendicular</strong> to the picture plane.</p>

<h3>Vertical Lines and Three-Point Perspective</h3>

<p>When the picture plane is tilted up or down, vertical lines <strong>tilt away</strong> from it, resulting in <strong>three-point perspective</strong>. This introduces a third vanishing point, either above or below the horizon line, where vertical lines converge.</p>

<h3>The Flexibility of Vanishing Points</h3>

<p>The third vanishing point in three-point perspective is <strong>flexible</strong>. Artists often take liberties with its placement:</p>

<ul>

<li>You can <strong>omit</strong> the third point for stylistic reasons.</li>

<li>You can <strong>bring it closer</strong> for dramatic effect.</li>

</ul>

<p>Understanding this flexibility allows for creative expression without being restricted by strict rules.</p>

<h2>Understanding Spatial Axes Over Vanishing Points</h2>

<p>Rather than focusing solely on counting vanishing points, it's essential to understand the <strong>three spatial axes</strong> (X, Y, Z). This approach emphasizes the object's orientation in space and helps in accurately depicting perspective.</p>

<h2>The Horizon Line as Eye Level</h2>

<h3>The Horizon in Landscapes</h3>

<p>In landscapes, the <strong>horizon</strong> is where the earth meets the sky. It's the line where <strong>receding parallel lines</strong>, that are level to the ground, appear to converge.</p>

<h3>The Moon Analogy</h3>

<p>An analogy to understand the horizon's behavior is the <strong>moon following you</strong> as you travel. The moon seems to stay with you because it's so far away that your movement doesn't significantly change its position relative to you. Similarly, the horizon remains at your eye level regardless of your position because it's effectively an infinite distance away.</p>

<h3>The Relationship Between Eye Level and Horizon</h3>

<p>The <strong>horizon line</strong> moves up or down in your field of view based on your <strong>eye level</strong>. This means:</p>

<ul>

<li>If you <strong>raise</strong> your eye level (e.g., stand on a hill), the horizon appears <strong>lower</strong> on nearby objects.</li>

<li>If you <strong>lower</strong> your eye level (e.g., crouch down), the horizon appears <strong>higher</strong> on nearby objects.</li>

</ul>

<p>Understanding this relationship is crucial for accurate perspective drawing.</p>

<h2>Foreshortening Near Eye Level</h2>

<h3>Angles on Paper</h3>

<p>As objects approach the eye level on paper, their planes become <strong>foreshortened</strong>:</p>

<ul>

<li>In <strong>one-point perspective</strong>, front corners become <strong>acute</strong> (less than 90 degrees), while back corners become <strong>obtuse</strong> (more than 90 degrees).</li>

<li>In <strong>two-point perspective</strong>, front and back corners become <strong>obtuse</strong>, while left and right corners become <strong>acute</strong>.</li>

</ul>

<p>As these planes move toward the eye level, they:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Spread out</strong> or <strong>open up</strong> when approaching the horizon.</li>

<li><strong>Compress</strong> into straight lines when they align with the eye level.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Foreshortening Explained Through the Picture Plane</h3>

<p>The <strong>picture plane</strong> is like a window through which the viewer sees the scene:</p>

<ul>

<li>When objects are <strong>above or below</strong> the eye level, you can see their <strong>top</strong> or <strong>bottom</strong> planes.</li>

<li>As objects <strong>approach</strong> the eye level, these planes <strong>foreshorten</strong> and eventually compress into <strong>lines</strong> at eye level.</li>

</ul>

<p>Understanding how the picture plane works helps explain why objects change appearance based on their position relative to the eye level.</p>

<h2>The Picture Plane and Perspective</h2>

<h3>Side View Explanation</h3>

<p>Viewing the scene from the side demonstrates how the viewer's eye level intersects with objects:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Objects above</strong> the eye level show their <strong>undersides</strong>.</li>

<li><strong>Objects at</strong> the eye level compress into <strong>lines</strong>.</li>

<li><strong>Objects below</strong> the eye level show their <strong>tops</strong>.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Top View and Vanishing Points</h3>

<p>A <strong>top view</strong> (plan view) helps in determining the exact placement of <strong>vanishing points</strong>:</p>

<ul>

<li>The distance between the viewer and the object affects the <strong>proximity</strong> of vanishing points.</li>

<li>Closer objects have vanishing points that are further apart on the horizon line.</li>

<li>Understanding this helps in accurately plotting perspective lines.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Skill-Building Project</h2>

<h3>Drawing Rooms with Eye Level at Different Heights</h3>

<p>Practice drawing <strong>rooms</strong> with the eye level placed at various heights:</p>

<ol>

<li>Start with the eye level near the <strong>center</strong> of the picture.</li>

<li>Draw the room in <strong>one-point</strong> or <strong>two-point perspective</strong>.</li>

<li>Observe how changing the eye level affects the angles and proportions.</li>

</ol>

<p><strong>Tips:</strong></p>

<ul>

<li>Begin with <strong>five minutes</strong> per sketch.</li>

<li>Gradually reduce to <strong>three minutes</strong>, then <strong>one minute</strong> as you become more comfortable.</li>

<li>Speed helps reinforce the concepts into your instincts.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Redrawing Scenes from New Heights</h3>

<p>Take existing scenes or photographs and redraw them from different eye levels:</p>

<ol>

<li><strong>Raise or lower</strong> the horizon line in your new drawing.</li>

<li>Adjust the angles of the receding lines accordingly.</li>

<li>Keep the proportions of objects consistent, focusing on how the perspective changes.</li>

</ol>

<p><strong>Remember:</strong></p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Looking down</strong>, lines go <strong>up</strong>.</li>

<li><strong>Looking up</strong>, lines go <strong>down</strong>.</li>

</ul>

<p>This exercise enhances your ability to visualize and render scenes from various perspectives.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p>Understanding how the <strong>eye level</strong> and <strong>horizon line</strong> influence perspective is essential for creating accurate and dynamic drawings. By practicing the concepts of <strong>receding lines</strong>, <strong>vanishing points</strong>, and the effects of the <strong>picture plane</strong>, you'll develop a stronger grasp of spatial relationships in your artwork. Keep experimenting with different viewpoints, and soon these principles will become second nature.</p>
