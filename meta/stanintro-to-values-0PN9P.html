<h2>What Is Value?</h2>

<p>In art, <strong>value</strong> refers to how light or dark something is, not its monetary worth. Values range from white to black, and include all the shades of gray in between. Incorporating values into your drawings creates the illusion of form and depth, making them look three-dimensional.</p>

<h2>Lines vs. Values</h2>

<p>Lines are useful for defining shapes but are abstractions, we don't actually see lines in reality. What we see is <strong>light affecting forms</strong>, which translates to values filling the shapes. Values bring your drawings to life by showing how light interacts with objects.</p>

<h2>Components of Color</h2>

<p>Color consists of three components:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Hue</strong>: The type of color (red, blue, yellow).</li>

<li><strong>Chroma</strong>: How pure or gray a color is.</li>

<li><strong>Value</strong>: The lightness or darkness of a color.</li>

</ul>

<p>Value is the most crucial component for creating form. You can adjust any color's value to make it lighter or darker, which affects how the form is perceived.</p>

<h2>The Value Scale</h2>

<p>Artists use a <strong>value scale</strong> from 0 (black) to 10 (white) to organize values. This simplifies the infinite gradation of light into manageable steps. We focus on measuring how light affects the subject, not just the pigment on paper.</p>

<h2>Working with Values</h2>

<p>You don't need all ten values in every drawing. Using a <strong>limited value scale</strong>, like five values, can be effective. Choosing specific value ranges helps set the mood, for example, using only darker values for a moody atmosphere.</p>

<h2>Factors Affecting Value</h2>

<p>Four factors determine the values we see:</p>

<ol>

<li><strong>Light on Form</strong>: How light falls on an object's surfaces.</li>

<li><strong>Local Value</strong>: The object's inherent lightness or darkness.</li>

<li><strong>Surface Material</strong>: The texture and reflectivity of the object.</li>

<li><strong>Atmosphere</strong>: The effect of air and distance on the object's appearance.</li>

</ol>

<p>As a beginner, focus on <strong>light on form</strong> and <strong>local value</strong>. The other factors are more advanced and can be explored later.</p>

<h2>Light on Form and Local Value</h2>

<p><strong>Light on form</strong> refers to how light affects different planes of an object. Surfaces facing the light are brighter, those turning away are darker. <strong>Local value</strong> is the object's inherent value regardless of lighting, a dark apple has a lower local value than a light apple.</p>

<p>These factors work together. Under the same lighting, a red apple's light side is darker than a yellow apple's due to their different local values.</p>

<h2>Practice with Values</h2>

<p>Before diving into color, practice using values to understand light and form. Working with shades of gray helps you see subtle shifts in light and shadow. Once you're comfortable with values, you can introduce color to add emotional impact to your art.</p>
