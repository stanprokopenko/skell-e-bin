<h2>Starting the Drawing</h2>

<p>I'm beginning my full color rendering of the eyes, and I am applying the knowledge and tips from earlier. I start with the <strong>gesture and lay-in</strong>, drawing the <strong>T in the face</strong>, which helps me find the important keystone shape between the eyebrows, the <strong>glabella</strong>.</p>

<p>I rough in the <strong>eyeline</strong> and use horizontal gesture lines to connect the creases between the hoods of the eyes and the upper eyelashes. I sketch the shape of the eye sockets and ensure I'm capturing the tilt of the eyes accurately.</p>

<h2>Adjusting the Perspective</h2>

<p>Before going further, I closely examine the <strong>perspective and tilt</strong> of the eyes. I notice I've exaggerated the tilt a bit too much in my initial gesture, so I adjust it to match the reference better. It's crucial to take the time to get these foundational aspects correct.</p>

<h2>Blocking in the Structure</h2>

<p>I block in the <strong>underlying eyeballs</strong> to build on top of them and achieve the three-dimensional wrapping of the eyelids. I lightly place these spheres in and draw vertical curved lines to indicate where the pupils will be.</p>

<p>I roughly block in the gesture of the eyelids. Before detailing one eye too much, I bring the other eye to the same level. This ensures symmetry and accuracy in the overall drawing.</p>

<h2>Mapping Out the Features</h2>

<p>I take my time with the <strong>lay-in</strong>, mapping out what I'm going to paint. I erase some construction lines and find the correct placement of the angle change between the glabella and the nasal bone by aligning it with the tear ducts. Adjustments are part of the process, and it's important to make corrections as needed.</p>

<h2>Placing the Irises and Pupils</h2>

<p>With the framing of the eyelids established, it is easier to place the <strong>irises</strong>. I pay attention to the <strong>negative shapes</strong> surrounding them, the shapes the sclera (white of the eye) creates around the irises. By getting these surrounding shapes accurate, I ensure the placement of the irises is correct.</p>

<p>I then lock in the <strong>pupils</strong>, noting that they might not be centered due to perspective. It's essential to capture these subtle shifts to maintain realism.</p>

<h2>Simplifying Eyelashes and Eyebrows</h2>

<p>I lock in the shapes of the <strong>eyelashes</strong>, seeing them as flat, designed shapes instead of thinking of them as individual hairs. I focus on clumping the eyelashes together into one designed shape, which I can break up later to add texture.</p>

<p>For the <strong>eyebrows</strong>, I also treat them as flat graphic shapes, focusing on the overall design rather than individual hairs.</p>

<h2>Preparing for Painting</h2>

<h3>Cleaning Up the Line Work</h3>

<p>I ensure all my <strong>line work</strong> is on one layer. I use the <strong>magic wand tool</strong> to select and remove any unwanted white areas from erasing and painting. This leaves me with a clean line layer, which I label as "line."</p>

<p>I <strong>colorize</strong> my line layer using the Hue/Saturation sliders, selecting a reddish-orange color. This gives the lines a warmer tone that complements the upcoming color work.</p>

<h3>Applying a Wash</h3>

<p>Underneath the line layer, I create a layer for my <strong>wash</strong>. Using a textured square brush, I apply a <strong>red-orange wash</strong> to eliminate the intimidating blank white canvas. This mid-tone value serves as a solid foundation for the painting.</p>

<h2>Applying Local Colors</h2>

<p>Between the line layer and the wash, I create another layer for the <strong>local colors</strong>. I fill in the local colors with flat values, not worrying about gradients or separating lights and darks yet.</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Skin Tone</strong>: I find the local color by looking at the midtones in the reference. This gives me a base color for the skin.</li>

<li><strong>Sclera</strong>: Starting with the skin color, I desaturate it slightly to create a realistic base for the whites of the eyes. Using pure white would make the eyes look unnatural.</li>

<li><strong>Irises</strong>: I choose a <strong>desaturated blue</strong>, since vibrant blue would be too saturated. The surrounding colors will make it appear more vivid.</li>

<li><strong>Pupils and Eyelashes</strong>: Instead of pure black, I use a dark, saturated <strong>red-orange</strong> to keep the image lively. Pure black can deaden the image.</li>

<li><strong>Eyebrows</strong>: I fill them in with a warm, desaturated color, treating them as flat graphic shapes.</li>

<li><strong>Tear Ducts</strong>: I block these in with a more pink, fleshy tone.</li>

</ul>

<p>Having these local colors on their own layer allows me to easily select and adjust specific elements later on.</p>

<h2>Separating Lights and Darks</h2>

<p>On a new layer above the local colors, I <strong>separate the lights and darks</strong>. I simplify the shadows into flat graphic shapes, similar to a comic book style.</p>

<ul>

<li>I choose a consistent <strong>shadow color</strong> for all skin areas in shadow.</li>

<li>Squinting my eyes helps me distinguish between light and shadow areas.</li>

<li>I apply the shadow color to the appropriate areas, careful not to worry about gradients at this stage.</li>

</ul>

<p>This step establishes the basic value structure of the painting.</p>

<h2>Blending and Adding Gradients</h2>

<h3>Merging Layers</h3>

<p>To begin blending, I create a new layer that <strong>merges all the visible layers</strong> into one. This allows me to paint over the entire image while keeping the previous layers intact for future adjustments.</p>

<h3>Using the Blender Tool</h3>

<p>I use the <strong>blender tool</strong> (smudge brush) to create soft edges and transitions. I focus on areas where gradients naturally occur, like the upper eyelids.</p>

<ul>

<li>I <strong>leave cast shadows sharper</strong> to maintain variation between hard and soft edges.</li>

<li>Variation between sharp and soft edges adds interest and realism to the painting.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Adding Highlights and Accents</h2>

<h3>Adding Highlights</h3>

<p>On a new layer, I start adding <strong>highlights</strong>:</p>

<ul>

<li>I choose <strong>cooler light colors</strong>, like pinks, to contrast with the warmer base colors.</li>

<li>I add highlights to areas like the tear ducts, corners of the eyes, and the nose.</li>

<li>Adjusting the <strong>opacity</strong> of the highlight layers helps control their intensity.</li>

<li>For stronger highlights, I use light, desaturated blues for bright spots.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Adding Dark Accents</h3>

<p>Next, I add <strong>dark accents</strong>:</p>

<ul>

<li>I focus on areas of occlusion, such as the corners of the eyes and under the eyelashes.</li>

<li>I use saturated <strong>reds and oranges</strong> to keep the shadows lively.</li>

<li>Adding these touches enhances depth and realism.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Finishing Touches</h2>

<h3>Refining Details</h3>

<p>At this point, it's about <strong>rendering until completion</strong>:</p>

<ul>

<li>I add brushwork and color variation.</li>

<li>I capture nuanced plane changes.</li>

<li>I work around the canvas, moving from area to area, reacting to what I see.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Adding Secondary Light Source</h3>

<ul>

<li>I introduce a subtle, desaturated <strong>lavender color</strong> as a secondary light source.</li>

<li>I keep it subdued to let the primary light source remain the focus.</li>

<li>Balancing multiple light sources adds depth without overwhelming the image.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Enhancing Brushwork</h3>

<p>I focus on adding variety in brushwork:</p>

<ul>

<li>I use different textures.</li>

<li>I allow some brush texture to show through.</li>

<li>Variation in brushwork adds interest and character to the painting.</li>

</ul>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p>Building a strong foundation with careful construction, accurate placement, and thoughtful layering sets me up for a successful final render. It's important to:</p>

<ul>

<li>Take your time with the initial lay-in.</li>

<li>Make adjustments as needed.</li>

<li>Not be afraid to correct mistakes.</li>

</ul>

<p>I hope this walkthrough has provided helpful insights into my process for drawing and painting eyes. Remember, practice and patience are key. Now, let's move on to the next chapter.</p>
