<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>I’m focusing on the <strong>deltoid mass</strong> and its interaction with surrounding muscles on black paper. This approach helps me practice both <strong>topographic lines</strong> (wrapping lines that show form), and <strong>halftones</strong> (showing subtle value transitions). Working on black paper forces me to think in reverse, using white pencil for highlights and allowing the black to serve as shadows.</p>

<h2>Deltoid and Trapezius</h2>

<p>The <strong>deltoid</strong> has three heads, front (anterior), middle, and rear (posterior). When the arm lifts, each head overlaps slightly, creating <strong>pockets</strong> or <strong>wedges</strong> in the figure,</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Rear Deltoid:</strong> Slips further back, creating a pocket behind the middle deltoid.  </li>

<li><strong>Middle Deltoid:</strong> Sits on the top and sides of the shoulder, often showing unique muscle striations in a flexed pose.  </li>

<li><strong>Acromion Process:</strong> Bony landmark where the deltoid and trapezius meet near the top of the shoulder.  </li>

</ul>

<p>The <strong>trapezius</strong> (trap) is prominent in shoulder movement. It bunches and compresses when the arm lifts, forming a <strong>bulge</strong> from the neck to the shoulder:</p>

<ul>

<li>As it travels up toward the skull, the trapezius leaves a <strong>column of raised muscle</strong> that you can follow visually with halftones.  </li>

<li>The seventh cervical vertebra sits in the small depression between the two trapezius columns at the base of the neck.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Scapula and Rotator Cuff</h2>

<p>Beneath the deltoid and trapezius lie the <strong>scapula</strong> (shoulder blade) and a group of <strong>rotator cuff muscles</strong> (infraspinatus, supraspinatus, teres minor, and subscapularis). When the arm lifts, the scapula <strong>fans around</strong> the ribcage:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Fanning Movement:</strong> This provides a critical range of motion for the arm. Tightness or injury (like “frozen shoulder”) can limit this sweeping motion.  </li>

<li><strong>Teres Major &amp; Minor, Infraspinatus:</strong> These lie close together on the back of the shoulder blade. Often, subtle shadow shapes indicate where they attach.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Drawing Technique on Black Paper</h2>

<p>I typically layer <strong>white pencil</strong> for highlights, letting the black paper serve as the shadow. Key points:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Halftones:</strong> I soften or lighten certain transitions so the black remains a subtle shadow.  </li>

<li><strong>Topographic Lines:</strong> Wrapping lines follow the curves of the trapezius, deltoid heads, or scapular muscles, revealing the form’s 3D structure.  </li>

<li><strong>Building Up Highlights:</strong> I use different softness levels of white pencils (like Prismacolor and Verithin) to push certain muscle shapes forward.  </li>

<li><strong>Lost and Found Edges:</strong> Sometimes I let an edge fade into the black paper if the light dissipates there.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Observations and Tips</h2>

<ol>

<li><strong>Stay Loose at First:</strong> My underdrawings are often rough, because I know I’ll spend more time refining and designing on top.  </li>

<li><strong>Use Personal Knowledge:</strong> Past injuries or physical therapy can deepen your understanding of scapular motion and rotator cuff function.  </li>

<li><strong>Constant Learning:</strong> No school covers everything, so integrate knowledge from diverse experiences (like CPR training or athletic pursuits).  </li>

<li><strong>Value Families:</strong> Keep half tones in the light family lighter than any shadowed areas. This separation maintains the illusion of form.  </li>

<li><strong>Experiment with Lines:</strong> Sometimes I draw <strong>cross-contours</strong> or “draw-through lines” that wrap over the shape, purely because they look engaging and clarify form.</li>

</ol>

<h2>Shoulder Close-Up Example</h2>

<p>When viewed from above, I see the <strong>top of the middle deltoid</strong> with a <strong>tiny sliver</strong> of the rear deltoid behind it. The <strong>trapezius</strong> can roll over and obscure part of the rear deltoid:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Traps Compress:</strong> When the arm is lifted or the shoulder is shrugged, the trapezius “bunches up” near the neck.  </li>

<li><strong>Deltoid Highlights:</strong> Each head of the deltoid may have different highlights and halftones, showing a “pinching and rolling” effect.  </li>

<li><strong>Peck/Deltoid Intersection:</strong> Where the <strong>pectoralis major</strong> runs into the deltoid, there’s often a small separation or crease, visible as a distinct halftone boundary.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Practical Application</h2>

<p>I first used this black paper/white pencil approach working on <strong>movie poster comps</strong>. Even though most work now is digital, practicing with traditional media:</p>

<ul>

<li>Sharpens <strong>hand dexterity</strong> and tonal control.  </li>

<li>Forces you to think about <strong>form</strong> rather than relying on layers or photo manipulation.  </li>

<li>Helps you see <strong>design opportunities</strong> (like showing rolling forms or striations in creative ways).</li>

</ul>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p>Working on black paper is a powerful exercise for learning <strong>shoulder anatomy</strong>, particularly how the <strong>deltoid</strong>, <strong>trapezius</strong>, and <strong>scapula</strong> interact. By mapping highlights and halftones, I train my eye to see <strong>form continuity</strong> and <strong>muscle transitions</strong> more clearly. If this feels too advanced, doing the same studies in charcoal on toned or white paper is a perfectly fine step. But I encourage you to push forward, experiment with line direction, vary your pencil pressure, and continually integrate new information about <strong>shoulder anatomy</strong> into your figure drawings.</p>
