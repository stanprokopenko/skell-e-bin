<p>At Proko, we've observed significant development in our students' face drawing skills, particularly in construction, form, and perspective. Many submissions were well-executed, making it challenging to find critique points. This progress demonstrates a strong internalization of the lessons. However, there's always room for improvement, so let's dive into some techniques to further enhance your face drawing skills.</p>

<h2>The Importance of Structure and Perspective</h2>

<p>The foundation of a great face drawing lies in its <strong>structure and perspective</strong>. We cannot stress enough the importance of establishing the big structural elements before diving into the details. This approach should be maintained regardless of the view you're drawing.</p>

<p><strong>Basic Face Construction Process:</strong></p>

<ol>

<li>Lay out major planes and proportions</li>

<li>Build up from basic shapes to complex forms</li>

<li>Use halves and thirds to guide feature placement</li>

</ol>

<p>Remember to <strong>maintain consistent perspective across all facial features</strong>. Always triple-check that features align with the overall head position and angle. This consistency is crucial for creating a believable and well-constructed face.</p>

<h2>Refining Facial Features</h2>

<p>Once you've established the basic structure, it's time to refine individual features. Here are some techniques for improving specific facial elements:</p>

<p><strong>Eyes:</strong>

- Wrap rectangles around eye spheres to develop eye structure

- Place eyes in the context of eye sockets before developing eyelids

- Avoid flat outlines by wrapping eyelids around the eyeball form

- Adjust eye size and shape as needed</p>

<p><strong>Nose:</strong>

- Use the wing of the nose/nostril to help place the corner of the eye

- Exaggerate planes, especially the underplane, for more depth</p>

<p><strong>Lips:</strong>

- Use curved lines to suggest form, avoiding flat lines

- Align the lip parting line with overall facial perspective

- Ensure lips touch the perspective wrap in the middle</p>

<p><strong>Ears:</strong>

- Place the ear on the side of the head so it feels grafted to the surface</p>

<h2>Advanced Tips and Techniques</h2>

<p>To take your face drawings to the next level, consider these advanced techniques:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Exaggerate neck direction</strong> to enhance diagonal movement</li>

<li><strong>Strengthen the jaw canopy</strong> for a more defined structure</li>

<li>Find more <strong>inside planes for eye sockets</strong> to add depth</li>

<li><strong>Push perspective and form</strong> in individual features</li>

<li><strong>Soften areas turning away</strong> from the viewer</li>

<li><strong>Push overlaps between features</strong> to create depth (e.g., nose overlapping cheek)</li>

<li><strong>Avoid tangent lines</strong> that flatten forms</li>

<li><strong>Subtly curve lines</strong> to suggest form, even in straight-on views</li>

</ul>

<p>Remember, every line is an opportunity to rethink edge. Be mindful of how lines relate to each other and aim for features to align with the same perspective line.</p>

<h2>Further Development and Practice</h2>

<p>To continue improving your skills, we suggest:</p>

<ul>

<li>Apply your structural knowledge to other art forms, such as painting</li>

<li>Explore smaller plane changes in features for more depth</li>

<li>Use your structural understanding to explain lighting and shadows</li>

<li>Practice wrapping simple shapes (boxes, rectangles) around basic forms</li>

<li>Consider moving to tonal work after extensive line drawing</li>

</ul>

<p>Developing both line and tone skills hand in hand will lead to a more comprehensive drawing practice. As you progress, you might want to develop tone alongside line work to enhance your understanding of structure.</p>

<p>By focusing on these areas and consistently practicing, you'll see continued improvement in your face drawing skills. Remember, the key is to always ground features in overall head construction before detailing, and to maintain a sense of perspective when developing individual features. Keep up the great work!</p>
