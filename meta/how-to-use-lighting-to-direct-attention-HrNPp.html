<h2>The Power of <strong>Contrast</strong></h2>

<p>Your eyes naturally seek out areas of <strong>contrast</strong>. <strong>Lighting</strong> plays a crucial role because it controls the contrast of a scene. When you look at an image, your eye is drawn to where the <strong>brightest brights</strong> and the <strong>darkest darks</strong> are placed next to each other.</p>

<p>For example, in a shot from <strong>"Arcane,"</strong> your eye automatically goes to the main character because that's where the highest contrast is. After noticing that character, you'll look for other areas of contrast, such as other characters who are lit with <strong>light on dark backgrounds</strong> or <strong>dark on light backgrounds</strong>.</p>

<h2>Light on Dark and <strong>Dark on Light</strong></h2>

<p>Using <strong>light on dark</strong> or <strong>dark on light</strong> helps define shapes and directs your attention. In a scene from <strong>"The Last of Us,"</strong> characters are silhouetted with strong shapes because the exposure is set for the bright daylight, creating dark figures against a light background. When the character turns around, they become light on a dark background, making it easy for you to focus on them.</p>

<h3>Examples</h3>

<p>In <strong>"Gladiator,"</strong> the young boy is the clear focal point. The filmmakers use the darkness of the trees and sunlight on his face to create <strong>high contrast</strong>, guiding your eye toward him. The mother's concerned face in the background is emphasized by using <strong>dark on a light background</strong>.</p>

<p>In <strong>"Batman Begins,"</strong> during the commissioner's office scene, they intentionally frame his face with <strong>light on dark</strong>. By placing light on his face and darkening the background, they create a point of contrast that draws your eye directly to him.</p>

<h2>High Key and <strong>Low Key</strong> Lighting</h2>

<p>Understanding general levels of exposure is essential. There are two key types - <strong>high key</strong> and <strong>low key</strong> lighting. Don't confuse these with high contrast and low contrast, they are the opposite.</p>

<h3>High Key Lighting</h3>

<p><strong>High key lighting</strong> means the scene is exposed for the shadows, resulting in a lot of light and minimal contrast. It's characterized by bright lighting where details are visible even in the shaded areas.</p>

<p>Examples of high key lighting include:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>"Oblivion"</strong>: Bright scenes with ample light bouncing around, fully illuminating the characters.</li>

<li><strong>"Star Wars"</strong>: Environments filled with light, reducing harsh shadows.</li>

<li><strong>"Mission Impossible: Fallout"</strong>: The bathroom fight scene is brightly lit, allowing you to see all the details clearly.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Low Key Lighting</h3>

<p><strong>Low key lighting</strong> is exposed for the light sources, not the shadows. This results in <strong>high contrast</strong> and darker scenes where shadows dominate. It's a powerful tool for conveying mood and tension.</p>

<p>Examples of low key lighting include:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>"Skyfall"</strong>: Scenes with high contrast where you can't see into the shadows well, creating a moody atmosphere.</li>

<li><strong>"Blade Runner 2049"</strong>: Characters are barely visible, enhancing the mysterious and tense mood.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Color Contrast</h2>

<p>Contrast isn't just about light and dark, it's also about <strong>color</strong>. When an object in a scene is a different color from everything else, your eye is automatically drawn to it.</p>

<h3>Examples</h3>

<ul>

<li><strong>"Schindler's List"</strong>: The girl in the red coat stands out because it's the only color in the film, directing your attention to her.</li>

<li><strong>"The Blue Umbrella"</strong>: A short film where a red character and a blue character stand out against a gray world.</li>

<li><strong>"John Wick"</strong>: A scene where all characters are lit green except for one character lit with orange light, making them the focal point.</li>

</ul>

<h2>The Importance of Color <strong>Palette</strong></h2>

<p>Simplified color palettes are usually more appealing because they are easier on the eyes and less confusing. Limiting the number of colors in a scene helps focus your attention and enhances storytelling.</p>

<h3>Simplified Palettes</h3>

<ul>

<li><strong>"Children of Men"</strong>: Uses mostly grays, greens, and blues with a single source of complementary color, like orange light, creating a simple and effective frame.</li>

<li><strong>"Looper"</strong>: Scenes are graded to be warm-toned and almost monochromatic, with the light dominating the image.</li>

<li><strong>"Close Encounters of the Third Kind"</strong>: Warm-dominated frames with some local colors, but the overall palette is controlled.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Two-Tone Palettes</h3>

<ul>

<li><strong>"True Grit"</strong>: Utilizes a two-tone palette with dominant blues and a single warm light source, creating a simplified and appealing image using complementary colors.</li>

<li><strong>"Magnolia"</strong>: Features moody scenes with heavy atmosphere and mist where the light dominates, simplifying the image and overriding local colors.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Light-Centric vs. <strong>Object-Centric</strong> Color</h2>

<p>You have a choice between having the color in the objects (<strong>object-centric</strong>) or having the color come from the lighting (<strong>light-centric</strong>).</p>

<h3>Object-Centric Color</h3>

<p>In some children's shows, characters and objects are brightly colored, one character is orange, another is red, another is yellow, and so on. This approach uses local colors to make the scene vibrant and appealing to children.</p>

<h3>Light-Centric Color</h3>

<p>Alternatively, films like <strong>"Klaus"</strong> use more subdued local colors for objects and let the <strong>lighting provide the color</strong>. Characters wear browns, grays, blacks, and whites, and the lighting adds color to the scenes. Each scene has a dominant color, making it beautiful and giving a sense of depth and composition.</p>

<p>There's no right or wrong choice here. It's about the feeling you want to convey in your work.</p>

<h2>Using Color to Support <strong>Storytelling</strong></h2>

<p><strong>Lighting</strong> and <strong>color</strong> can be used strategically to support the story's emotional arc.</p>

<h3>Example: <strong>"The Incredibles"</strong></h3>

<p>In <strong>"The Incredibles,"</strong> the filmmakers created a <strong>color script</strong> to guide the use of color throughout the film:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Beginning</strong>: Hyper-saturated colors during Mr. Incredible's memories, with super orange sunsets and super blue nights, reflecting the excitement of his superhero days.</li>

<li><strong>Middle</strong>: Present-day scenes where Mr. Incredible sells insurance are washed out and monochromatic, symbolizing his loss of purpose and dissatisfaction.</li>

<li><strong>Progression</strong>: As he returns to superhero work, more color is gradually introduced, showing his revitalization.</li>

<li><strong>End</strong>: When the family unites, colors become more natural and balanced, symbolizing harmony and the resolution of his internal conflict.</li>

</ul>

<p>Here, <strong>lighting</strong> is used not just for visual appeal but to mirror the protagonist's journey and emotional state.</p>
