<h2>Working with Traditional Materials</h2>

<p>I primarily work in oils for my finishes, which isn't very common these days. Many artists are moving towards digital mediums, but I stick to <strong>traditional materials</strong> almost exclusively. There are others experimenting with <strong>mixed media</strong>, and that's exciting to see. I've dabbled a bit myself, starting a piece with a graphite rendering or a black and white gouache painting, then adding digital effects and color on top. It's a fast approach because working in black and white removes one of the problem-solving aspects from the process, allowing me to work more quickly.</p>

<p>I also work <strong>fairly large for comics</strong>, which might be unique to my process. But when it comes to idea development, my approach isn't unique at all. I follow a pretty standard academic approach to illustration.</p>

<h2>My Artistic Process</h2>

<p>I simplify ideas into multiple thumbnails, refining what I want using a more or less <strong>three-value process</strong>, focusing on design and composition. I gather whatever reference I might need and flesh out the thumbnail. Once I've nailed that down, I might do some color comps before moving on to the finish. The goal is to have as little problem-solving in the finish as possible, or at least minimize guesswork.</p>

<p>Most illustrators I know work this way. Depending on the deadline, they might eliminate one of those steps or combine them, but I don't think anyone prefers to work that way. It's just the nature of hitting deadlines.</p>

<h3>Dealing with Deadlines</h3>

<p>Deadlines vary greatly in this industry. In comics, they might want a cover in <strong>a week</strong>. My editors are starting to learn that while I can do that, it's rare that I have nothing on my plate to where they can assign me something, and I can have it done in a week. It takes me a whole week, and that's the fastest I've ever done a cover. I couldn't maintain that pace consistently.</p>

<p>I've had deadlines where a cover was assigned on a Wednesday and due the next Monday. I've also had covers that weren't due for two or three months. It depends on the type of cover. For instance, <strong>variant covers</strong> often have longer deadlines because they don't need them for solicitation. For the regular cover, if you're the regular cover artist, you know you have one every month, so you can plan for it.</p>

<h2>Early Inspirations</h2>

<p>I've loved comics for as long as I can remember, but there was one specific comic that made me start to identify as an artist. It was an <strong>X-Men annual drawn by Art Adams</strong>, the Asgard Wars annual. The cover featured Storm with her own version of Thor's hammer, Mjolnir, swinging it, with Colossus standing behind her. Art Adams is amazing, he changed what it meant to draw comics for a lot of people.</p>

<p>That was the first thing I ever drew where I remembered having that comic in my hands, running home, finding paper and pencils, and sitting down to draw. That's where my love of drawing in the comic genre came from.</p>

<h3>Favorite Comics and Storylines</h3>

<p>Two storylines that stand out for me are the <strong>Mutant Massacre</strong> and <strong>Inferno</strong>, both from the '80s X-Men. Mutant Massacre spanned most of the Marvel Universe, focusing on the mutants and the X-Men, but even included an issue of Thor. Inferno is another favorite. I couldn't tell you whether it's nostalgia or true appreciation, but I've gone back and read both recently and still love them.</p>

<h2>The Magic of Storytelling in Comics</h2>

<p>What makes comics so compelling is the <strong>panel-to-panel breakdown</strong>. In my mind, when I think back to many of the best comics I've read, it is like a movie. It moves, it has pacing. Yet, I know it's just a page with doodles on it. But when I recall it, I see a movie. The characters move, breathe, and talk. That's a testament to the artists who have tricked my brain so thoroughly.</p>

<p>They've created an illusion so convincing that it affects my memory and perception. When we look at animation, there's enough still images to create movement. That's not the case with comics, but in my mind's eye, I see real characters interacting. The illusion is that compelling to my imagination.</p>

<h2>Cinematic Influences</h2>

<p>I'm always looking at movies and trying to bring a <strong>cinematic approach</strong> to my illustration. I use cinematic lighting techniques, camera placement, and staging. I often study great directors like <strong>Spielberg</strong> and <strong>Hitchcock</strong>. When I watch their movies, I'll make notes if I see a scene, lighting scenario, or camera placement that inspires me. I might sketch a little thumbnail and think about doing an illustration that evokes that mood.</p>

<p>Much like a musician riffing on a tune, I'll borrow elements that trigger a response in me and try to elicit a similar response in those who view my illustrations. So, movies are a big influence for me.</p>

<h2>Developing Ideas and Observing the World</h2>

<p>Developing ideas is usually just a lot of sweat and effort, hammering out drawing after drawing until I shape it into what I want. But where it starts is observing things around me. It might be a movie, vacationing, going to a park, or just seeing the way light hits a form. Perhaps the mist sticks to the ground in the morning, or the way light streams through a window. I observe these things, try to remember them, mix them with my imagination, and incorporate them into my work when appropriate.</p>

<p>It's about bringing authenticity to a fictional, larger-than-life world.</p>

<h2>Breaking into Comics</h2>

<p>I was at Comic-Con with my portfolio, showing it around to various companies. A small company gave me an opportunity to paint a variant cover for them. I couldn't have been happier because comics had been my dream since I knew it was a thing. As a kid, I didn't even know that comics were a way to make a living. I thought the artists had day jobs and did comics on the side.</p>

<p>In 2007, I got my opportunity, doing a cover for a small company. I would get one or two covers a year from various small companies. Eventually, a friend gave me the contact information of the talent relations manager at Marvel. I dropped him an email, sent some of my work, and he asked if I could do a sample for them. Unfortunately, I was busy at the time.</p>

<p>Later, I did a cover for another company, and it got a lot of exposure. It made it onto someone's top ten list for comic covers that month. The talent relations manager at Marvel reached out and asked if I could do that style, a graphite rendering with digital coloring, for a project. I agreed, and that led to me being the regular cover artist for one of their <strong>Disney Kingdom series</strong>.</p>

<p>After that, I got contacted a few more times but couldn't take the covers due to other commitments. I eventually saved up money, decided not to take any other freelance for six months, and waited for Marvel to call again. When they did, I jumped at the opportunity. That was my first painted cover for them, and it was for an anniversary issue of <strong>Crazy</strong>.</p>

<h2>Favorite Characters and Teams</h2>

<h3>Favorite Marvel Character</h3>

<p>My favorite Marvel character is <strong>Wolverine</strong>, and it probably will be for a third of the people you ask. My second choice would be <strong>Spider-Man</strong>, and that's another popular choice. If I'm going for a dark horse choice, it's <strong>Longshot</strong>. I love Longshot from the X-Men. He was one of the first new characters I was introduced to as a kid.</p>

<h3>Most Fun Team to Read</h3>

<p><strong>X-Men</strong> is easily the most fun team to read. That's going to be many people's first choice. But if I'm going for something different, <strong>The Defenders</strong> is one of the most fun. They're a team that isn't really a team, especially the version where none of the characters particularly like each other.</p>

<h3>Favorite Villain</h3>

<p>Again, I could go with the standard answers like <strong>Magneto</strong> or <strong>Doctor Doom</strong>, but if I'm going for an offbeat one, it's <strong>Mojo</strong>. Connected to Longshot, Mojo is probably my unique choice for a favorite villain.</p>

<h3>Best Costume Design</h3>

<p><strong>Spider-Man</strong> has the greatest costume design of all time. Bar none, the single greatest superhero design. Even his secondary costume, the black costume, was an amazingly cool design. The original Ditko Spider-Man design is ridiculously cool.</p>

<h2>Advice for Aspiring Artists</h2>

<h3>Learn to Draw</h3>

<p>Learn to draw. Even if you're going to use professional tools like 3D modeling programs or even AI, you still need to learn how to draw. That's what's going to separate you from others who might be abusing the tools. If you use the tools and combine them with really solid fundamental drawing skills, you'll stand out.</p>

<h3>Three Things You Need</h3>

<ul>

<li><strong>Solid Fundamentals</strong>: I've talked about this several times now.</li>

<li><strong>A Love of Doing It</strong>: Passion is essential.</li>

<li><strong>A Unique Creative Vision</strong>: Develop your own voice and style.</li>

</ul>

<p>If you can develop these three things, you'll have work from here to the end of time.</p>

<h3>Overcoming Challenges</h3>

<p>The two biggest things that held me back for a long time were <strong>speed</strong> and <strong>originality</strong>. Finding my own unique voice and trusting it, not chasing another artist's style, was crucial. Also, speed is mandatory. In this industry, being able to produce quality work under tight deadlines is essential.</p>

<h3>Common Mistakes</h3>

<p>In illustration, the most common issue is <strong>figure drawing</strong>. In comics, many aspiring artists struggle with <strong>storytelling</strong>. They get enamored with pinups and splash pages but miss the importance of panel-to-panel storytelling. You need to elicit emotion from the viewer by telling a story.</p>

<h3>Improving Storytelling</h3>

<p>Improving storytelling is tough because it's so unique. My biggest advice is to look at people who do it well. Study artists like <strong>Alex Ross</strong>, <strong>Julian Totino Tedesco</strong>, <strong>Dean Cornwell</strong>, <strong>Norman Rockwell</strong>, and even going back to <strong>Caravaggio</strong>. Dissect how they told compelling stories.</p>

<p>You become a storyteller by telling stories. Be around storytellers, tell stories, and make them your own. Personalize them and try to elicit your feelings from others when you tell the story.</p>

<h2>Dealing with Self-Doubt and Burnout</h2>

<p>Yes, I struggle with self-doubt. I'm struggling with it right at this moment. I don't think I've overcome it, and I don't think I ever will. The way I deal with it is by focusing on what's in front of me. I don't worry about people's response to my work until it's done. While working on a job, it's about finishing it and doing the best I can. I can get depressed about it later, but I try not to during the process.</p>

<p>I've experienced burnout, and it comes from grinding and grinding. The way professionals deal with it is that they do not have a choice. That's what being a professional is, you show up and get it done. If you commit to doing something, you do it to the best of your ability.</p>

<h2>Maintaining Motivation</h2>

<p>The only thing that hampers my motivation is <strong>fatigue</strong>. At a certain point, you just get tired. But I never don't want to do it. Motivation is rarely a problem for me. Sometimes, the mind is willing, but the body isn't able. Even when I tell my wife I'm taking a day off, she turns around, and I'm sketching in my sketchbook. I have more motivation than I have time.</p>

<h2>The Hardest Part of Being a Professional Artist</h2>

<p>It's a tie for me. <strong>Deadlines</strong> are physically the hardest thing, getting as close to 100% as you can within the confines of the deadline. The other challenge is <strong>physical ability</strong>. Eventually, everyone hits their wall. When you get to a point where you're turning down jobs you want to do, it can be very frustrating.</p>

<h3>Dealing with Deadlines and Limitations</h3>

<p>I always try to do my best within the deadlines. My editors and art directors can rest assured that if I miss a deadline, it's because I hit a wall and there was no way to get it done on time without compromising quality. It's either turning in something forced that nobody will be happy with or delivering it a day or two later and having something everyone is pleased with.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p>Realize that you're rarely going to be able to do 100%. Everyone gets into this thinking they'll be the one to do 100%, but the fact is, life gets in the way. By the time you go through art direction, editorial review, deadlines, and personal life events, it's rare to reach 100% of your optimum.</p>

<p>If your portfolio is purely dependent on spending six months on each piece, you might be in trouble when you start getting jobs because that's not how it works. You're going to have shorter deadlines than you want, and you'll have to do things you didn't initially envision.</p>

<p>Art isn't any different from any other job. It's not a magical living with unicorns and rainbows, it's a lot of hard work, but it's very rewarding. When you turn something in, and people react positively, it brings joy to their lives, even if it's just for 15 minutes. It's immensely rewarding, but it's also a job, and that means doing good work on a schedule.</p>
