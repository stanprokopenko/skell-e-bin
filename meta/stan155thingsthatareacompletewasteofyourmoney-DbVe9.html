<h2>1. Bulk Purchases</h2>

<p>Buying in bulk seemed smart, but living with my girlfriend, we can't consume everything before it expires. Now, I buy regular sizes for perishables.</p>

<h2>2. Not Knowing How to Save</h2>

<p>Wealth isn't just about income, it's about saving. I struggled until I learned effective saving strategies, which improved my finances.</p>

<h2>3. Unintentional Spending</h2>

<p>Stores tempt us to overspend with tactics like big carts and enticing layouts. I make a shopping list and stick to it to avoid impulse buys.</p>

<h2>4. Expensive Designer Glasses</h2>

<p>Many designer glasses are made in the same factories as cheaper ones. Brands like <strong>Luxottica</strong> inflate prices. I avoid paying extra for a name.</p>

<h2>5. Not Using "Love It or Leave It"</h2>

<p>I used to buy clothes I only liked, rarely wearing them. Now, I only buy items I <strong>love</strong>, focusing on quality over quantity.</p>

<h2>6. Overpaying for Medicine</h2>

<p>Generic drugs have the same quality as brand-name versions. I buy generics to save money without sacrificing effectiveness.</p>

<h2>7. Missing Travel Savings with VPNs</h2>

<p>Using a VPN to change my location when booking flights has saved me hundreds by accessing lower regional prices.</p>

<h2>8. Ignoring eSIMs Abroad</h2>

<p>An <strong>eSIM</strong> connects me to the internet overseas without costly roaming fees or local SIMs. It's a convenient, cost-effective solution.</p>

<h2>9. Not Requesting Fee Waivers</h2>

<p>Credit card late fees can be waived if you ask politely. If refused, I try again with a different representative.</p>

<h2>10. Poor Negotiation on Big Purchases</h2>

<p>Effective negotiation creates win-win situations. When buying my car, I used data and sought added benefits like better financing.</p>

<h2>11. Falling for Sales Tricks</h2>

<p>Sales exploit the <strong>anchoring effect</strong>, making discounts seem better. I remind myself that a deal isn't savings if I don't need the item.</p>

<h2>12. Skipping Cashback Online</h2>

<p>I use cashback programs when shopping online, saving money on purchases I already plan to make.</p>

<h2>13. Unnecessary Souvenirs</h2>

<p>Instead of bulky souvenirs, I buy small items like magnets, affordable, easy to pack, and meaningful reminders of my trips.</p>

<h2>14. Buying Lottery Tickets</h2>

<p>Odds of winning the lottery are tiny, you're more likely to be struck by lightning. I no longer buy tickets.</p>

<h2>15. Paying ATM Fees</h2>

<p>ATM fees add up. I opened an account that reimburses fees worldwide, saving me money when I withdraw cash.</p>

<h2>15.5 Paying for Hotel Wi-Fi</h2>

<p>Hotels often charge for Wi-Fi, but joining their free rewards programs grants complimentary access. I always sign up to avoid fees.</p>
