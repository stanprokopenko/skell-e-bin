<p>My name is Eric Gist, but you'll most often see me credited as <strong>EMGIST</strong>. I've worked on a lot of different stuff in the comic industry, primarily as a cover artist. Some of my favorite covers include a <strong>Fantastic Four</strong> cover and an <strong>Iron Fist</strong> cover. I've also done variant covers for <strong>Wolverine</strong> and <strong>Hulk</strong>, a lot of one-off projects.</p>

<h2>My Favorite Comic Covers</h2>

<p>Choosing a favorite cover is tough because I like a lot of them for different reasons. It's probably between my <strong>Fantastic Four</strong> cover and my <strong>Hulk</strong> cover.</p>

<p>The <strong>Hulk</strong> cover was really cool because it was an action scene, which I don't do a ton of. It was a classic fight scene between Wolverine and Hulk, something almost every comic artist wants to do at one time or another. It was even more exciting because it featured a zombie Wolverine, which was pretty cool since I'm kind of known for doing zombies.</p>

<p>The <strong>Fantastic Four</strong> cover was a lot of fun because there was a bit more storytelling involved. You've got more characters, each with their own characteristics, and the whole family dynamic. Trying to work all that into a single image was a good challenge and something I really enjoyed.</p>

<h2>How I Started in Comics</h2>

<p>My first cover was back in 2007, so I've been doing this for about 15 years. I started working with Marvel around 2016, with my first work being a series of covers for the <strong>Haunted Mansion</strong> series. My first real Marvel character cover was for the anniversary issue of <strong>Crazy</strong> in 2019. So, I've been working on Marvel-specific, on-brand covers for about four or five years.</p>

<p>The first thing I wanted to do in art was draw comic books. I was always into comics from the time I was a little kid. Around the age of eight, I considered myself a comic fan and tried to get everything I could. I wanted to do interiors and worked on submissions every month to all the companies. I got tons of rejection letters, some of which I still have.</p>

<p>Then I started training with Jeff Watts and found out I had more of a knack for single-image storytelling. I still loved the genre of comics but wanted to get more into painting and covers. It took me about ten years to get good enough and about another five to catch on doing them.</p>

<h2>My Work in Comics</h2>

<p>In comics, I've only done covers. I've been asked to do interiors a couple of times, but it wasn't anything that ever really grabbed my interest. If I'm going to do interiors, it's going to have to be something that I really want to work on, something that I'm really excited about.</p>

<p>Tangential to comics, I've also done some <strong>card illustrations</strong>, which is very similar to doing covers. They end up printing them on cards instead of covers, and there are a few design-specific things that are a little bit different, but for the most part, it's very similar.</p>

<h2>My Artistic Style and Influences</h2>

<p>Broadly speaking, my style is often dictated by how I feel about the characters, not in a "like them" or "don't like them" way. It is more about capturing the essence of the characters to come across in the image.</p>

<p>I'm known for <strong>deep shadows</strong>, <strong>high contrast</strong>, and <strong>moodier stuff</strong>, kind of a noir or, for lack of a better term, a horror feel. Something a little bit darker is what I'm known for.</p>

<p>In the last year or two, I've been branching out into some brighter-colored stuff, but I've also been getting asked to do brighter characters. For example, the <strong>Fantastic Four</strong> are not really known for being dark and moody, and that was a lot of fun. I went in kind of more of a <strong>Norman Rockwell direction</strong> with that, he's one of my favorite artists of all time.</p>

<p>With my <strong>Iron Fist</strong> cover, I went in a brighter-colored direction, showing the history of the character and the literal passing of the torch. I could have found some dark covers to do with that character, but I wanted to show the brighter side.</p>

<p>I don't want to get stuck doing just the same thing over and over. I want to be one of those guys that gets asked to do just about everything.</p>

<h2>Artists I Admire</h2>

<p>There are a lot of artists that I admire, especially from the past, but also many contemporary artists. The artists I really pick out are those that have a balance between an <strong>iconic image</strong> and a <strong>story</strong>.</p>

<p>Your initial read on their work is something that you're never going to forget. It's an image that's burned into your head, like the first time you come home to see your mom after your first day ever going to school, deep in your soul, you'll never forget it. That's the kind of painting I want to make.</p>

<h2>Advice for Aspiring Comic Artists</h2>

<h3>Specialize First</h3>

<p>That's a tough question, but I would definitely <strong>specialize</strong> at first. As far as specializing in what, that's going to depend on where your fire is and where your natural abilities lie. Get really, really good at one thing first. You're going to be way better off than being mediocre at three different things.</p>

<p>Once you feel like you've got a good handle, you can start to branch out. Comics definitely seem to be heading in the direction of the well-rounded artist. When I was a kid, there were pencilers, inkers, and colorists, and that's what you did. Now, those lines are getting a lot blurrier. I think art directors and editors like to see someone who can do it all, so it's sort of one-stop shopping for them.</p>

<h3>Studying and Improving</h3>

<p>As far as getting better at making covers specifically, I would say <strong>study the people that are good at it</strong>. Don't limit yourself to just contemporary artists. Go back to cover artists, not just comic cover artists, but cover artists going all the way back through the long history of illustration. Also, look at narrative painters going back even before print.</p>

<p>I study people like <strong>Bouguereau</strong>, <strong>Caravaggio</strong>, and <strong>Rembrandt</strong>. I look at their work as much or more than I do people that are working today. I think it's one of the things that sets my work apart a little bit, it has sort of a timeless feel to it. That's what I strive for with my artwork. I don't want it to feel trendy or modern, but at the same time, I don't want it to feel dated.</p>

<h3>Work on Your Fundamentals</h3>

<p>Work on your <strong>fundamentals</strong>, and make covers. Anything you do, if you want to get better at golf, go play golf. If you want to do covers, make covers. <strong>Make some bad covers</strong>. Get them out of your system. Do a lot of them. That's how you're going to get better.</p>

<p>But that's still going to be built on good, solid fundamentals. Find someplace where you can learn that. Study your fundamentals, study hard, have a wide variety of influences, and make covers. That's how you're going to get good.</p>

<h2>The Importance of Fundamentals</h2>

<p>The fundamentals in my mind would be:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Figure Drawing</strong>: Basic drawing, fundamental forms, lighting, anatomy.</li>

<li><strong>Color Theory</strong>: A good understanding of how colors work together.</li>

<li><strong>Perspective</strong>: Understanding how to depict space and form.</li>

<li><strong>Composition</strong>: Creating interesting and compelling arrangements.</li>

</ul>

<p>When you're talking about being good, they are all pretty important. You can't really put one on top of the other other than, like I said, figure drawing is obviously going to be more important because it's comics, it's about figures, it's about people, first and foremost.</p>

<p>If you can draw a cool, dynamic figure, you can get away with a lot of sins in other areas. Not that I'm encouraging that, but you're going to get more work being able to draw a really great Spider-Man and a mediocre car than you are being able to draw a great car and a mediocre Spider-Man.</p>

<h2>Embracing Limitations in Creativity</h2>

<p>Of course, it's limiting to try and fit as much of a story as you can into one image or represent an entire plotline with one image, but <strong>limiting in a good way</strong>.</p>

<p>Limitations or restrictions can breed creativity because you have to find a way around them. You have to find a creative solution, and the more creative solution you have to come up with, the more likely you are to be original. The more limitations that are put on you, the more you have to dig a little bit deeper, and anything that makes you dig deeper is great for creativity.</p>

<p>That's why <strong>thumbnails</strong> are such an important part of the process. A friend of mine once said that the first five thumbnails you do are always someone else's idea. You have to get to that five-thumbnail point. Usually, the way mine breaks down is I do five thumbnails that are usually someone else's idea, and I just don't realize it. It's just things I've seen before and are stored up in my head, part of the zeitgeist.</p>

<p>Then another five are bad ideas, and finally, about that tenth sketch, you start getting into something that is somewhat unique to you and good. It's important to get to that point of doing 10, 15, 20 sketches and not limiting yourself to just your first idea.</p>

<h2>Reflections on My Career</h2>

<p>I started doing comic covers when I already had quite a bit of knowledge and experience under my belt. I'd worked in video games for about five years, and I'd done illustration in other areas for about five years. I just wish I knew <strong>how good you had to be</strong>.</p>

<p>Each level you go up, especially in comics, there is sort of this tier system. You'll start off working for third or fourth-tier companies, not that those companies aren't good or that you're not doing good work, but you aren't in front of the broad populace as much.</p>

<p>You want to make sure that you're as good as you possibly can be before you're getting broad exposure to a comparatively large audience. I wish I would have known how good you had to be.</p>

<p>When I was 17 or 18 years old, I was doing pages and submitting them to Marvel and DC and Image, which was just ridiculous. But I didn't know any better, and it didn't hurt at all. Maybe I benefited from my own ignorance because it kept me motivated and kept me producing work.</p>

<p>Now, years later, I'm doing covers, and I still look at my work and sometimes they'll go out the door, and I'll just go, "I wish that was better." Because it's on the rack next to people like <strong>Alex Ross</strong> and <strong>Totino Tedesco</strong> and a myriad of great cover artists. You don't want to say you're competing with them, but you're definitely competing for sales with those people.</p>

<p>You don't want to make it all about the sales, but it's part of the job. Your job is to sell comics. To me, my job is to do a good image, but for whatever company you're working for, it's about selling books. You have to be able to sell books, and you want to make sure that you're good enough to sell books.</p>
