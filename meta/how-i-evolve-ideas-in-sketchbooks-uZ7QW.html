<p>Hello! My name is Faith. I'm an artist working in animation, comics, freelance illustration, and you might know me from my personal artwork, which is very fantasy, girls with swords. Basically, that's the vibe.</p>

<p>I have three sketchbooks to show you today.</p>

<ul>

<li>

<p><strong>My 'No Thoughts, Head Empty' Sketchbook</strong>: This is what I do while I'm on the couch watching TV. It's ink, and I post it on my Instagram because it looks nice. It's just stream-of-consciousness stuff.</p>

</li>

<li>

<p><strong>My Actual Sketchbook</strong>: This is where I plan everything I'm going to do. I thumbnail out stuff and have new ideas here. It's very ugly, but I'm being vulnerable and showing it to you today.</p>

</li>

<li>

<p><strong>My Travel Sketchbook</strong>: These are largely drawn either from photos I take or on the spot when I'm traveling.</p>

</li>

</ul>

<p>Let's start with the pretty sketchbook to earn your trust.</p>

<h2>My 'No Thoughts, Head Empty' Sketchbook</h2>

<p>In this sketchbook, I largely use the Pentel waterproof ink brush, and I also add markers. I go back into this sketchbook quite a lot and just draw what comes to me. I'm often sitting on the couch, watching TV, and this stuff ends up making its way into my finished work sometimes, but for the most part, it's just for fun.</p>

<p>I frequently reiterate while working in this sketchbook, because I find a nugget of an idea that I like and start chasing it. For example, I did some drawings that were sort of <strong>Daphne-esque</strong> - inspired by the myth where she turns into a tree rather than date Apollo. I thought the idea of a face in a tree was really cool, so I kept drawing that for a bit.</p>

<p>I also like coming up with fun costume stuff while I'm in this sketchbook. There are a lot of <strong>fairies</strong> and also a lot of <strong>monster girls</strong>. I don't know what was up with that!</p>

<p><strong>Do I find myself chasing one specific thing for an entire sketchbook or a few pages at a time?</strong></p>

<p>I think it's a few pages at a time for me, for the most part. I'll come back to it when I'm flipping through my sketchbook again. I'll just be like, "Oh, that, yeah," and then I'll keep going back to it.</p>

<p><strong>Do my sketchbooks cross-pollinate?</strong></p>

<p>They cross-pollinate a bit for sure. Usually, this sketchbook is not intended to inform my finished artwork. I'm not trying to do nice compositions, but sometimes happy accidents happen where I'm like, "Oh, this looks really nice," and I'll toss it to my computer or whatever.</p>

<p>One drawing in here ended up inspiring another finished series I did, which was a foil print series of <strong>bird girls</strong>. I guess they're harpies or sirens? It was seasonal, so I did winter, spring, summer, and fall.</p>

<p>Another drawing in this sketchbook ended up inspiring a watercolor that I don't think was very good, but I really like the composition. It's based on the <strong>Judgment of Paris</strong>, the story where a golden apple falls, and it's for the fairest. I chased that idea on both pages, in different ways. I ended up going with one for the watercolor, which I'm going to tackle again at some point because I didn't do a good job the first time, but I love this composition.</p>

<p><strong>What is my end goal with this sketchbook?</strong></p>

<p>That's a good question. I don't usually make finished stuff outside of this sketchbook, but sometimes it happens where I'm like, "Oh, I was kind of cooking, you know?" That idea kind of worked, so I'll explore it. But generally, it's just a free space to create.</p>

<h2>My Actual Sketchbook</h2>

<p>One thing is I always, for my real sketchbooks, work on <strong>gridded paper</strong>. One reason is that the grids help me literally compose shots, I just count the cubes, and I'm like, "Alright, this is 11 by 17." But the other way it helps is, it makes me not fuss at all. I'm just like, "Okay, I'm down to business."] I don't care if this looks good. It's just going to get done.</p>

<p>The front pages I'm showing now are from a <strong>tarot series</strong> that I actually just posted on my Instagram. It's for a 3D Total book where each artist illustrated one tarot suit. I wanted to share it because I think it came out really cool. The compositions here more or less stayed the same when I moved to finishing it digitally.</p>

<p>From there, you can see that I just started planning random things. There are a lot of little squares that you'll see, and they'll be hard to read. I was planning a <strong>Birth of Venus</strong> piece. I do chase that later in the book actually.</p>

<p>I was also planning a <strong>Sleeping Beauty</strong> piece that I haven't made yet, where the prince or princess character, in my case, is fighting the big dragon. Here's Aurora with the spindle. I still haven't pursued this yet.</p>

<p>I was planning a <strong>Little Mermaid</strong> piece that I'd like to make at some point.</p>

<p>This was for a <strong>VTuber</strong> I was thinking about making, because I was considering streaming. I have a few sketches of that. She was a vampire, I had the BRB screen as the lo-fi girl but a vampire. I had a bunch of ideas.</p>

<p>This is another piece from the <strong>Greek mythology series</strong> that I've been trying to do. I'm exploring the idea of doing the <strong>labyrinth where the Minotaur is</strong>, so I wanted to do gothic walls and stuff instead of your traditional stone walls, but I haven't quite figured this one out.</p>

<p>Sometimes the actual drawing just gets pretty directly translated into a finished piece. I fairly recently did this one as a watercolor. I tried to capture as much from the original drawing as I possibly could. I still kind of like the original drawing better, but I really love how the watercolor came out. Overall, I'm very happy.</p>

<p>Some more drawings, I really like the cape on this guy. A lot of big hats in this sketchbook. A lot of big hats.</p>

<p>I was exploring the idea of <strong>Andromeda</strong> from the Greek myth where she's chained to a rock at sea and waiting for a sea monster to eat her. Here's more Andromeda stuff and more labyrinth stuff, neither of which I ended up using.</p>

<p><strong>Do I find myself setting out to do any particular style each time?</strong></p>

<p>Yeah, I think for the most part I have a pretty consistent style, but I do have one style that's a bit cuter and more animation-friendly, and then I have my own style, which is a bit more what I like to do but it's less practical for things like animating. So I have two distinct styles, and I just sort of flip through them depending on the situation.</p>

<p>This was me trying to plan an <strong>Icarus</strong> piece, and I'm still sort of trying to plan that, but I'm not totally sure if I'm going to do it.</p>

<p>I don't know what this was about, I like it though.</p>

<p>Sometimes I do random convention planning in here, so if you see my name written out, it's because I was planning a banner for my table. It's not because I'm a narcissist, I was just planning out a banner.</p>

<p>I was planning to do long, skinny <strong>Studio Ghibli</strong> film fan art. I liked the idea of having very long panels where one element was glowing because I feel like that's quite frequently seen in Ghibli films, and have them all go together like a nice little series. Still thinking about it though.</p>

<p>This one actually ended up being a finished illustration pretty directly. I started trying to design characters for fun, and they were themed around <strong>light and fire</strong>. So the next few pages are <strong>light bulb girl</strong>, <strong>phoenix guy</strong>, and this guy was a tree burning from the inside kind of character, just as an exercise for myself for a project I haven't done. A little <strong>lantern guy</strong>, I like this one. It's very <strong>Final Fantasy IX</strong>.</p>

<p>Sometimes I do word puzzles in my sketchbook, so very unfussy.</p>

<p>I wanted to do a series of seasonal pieces based on the idea of a <strong>dragon hunter</strong>. I have a few pages where I'm exploring that. I really like the idea of tall grass and maybe the dragons going by in the background like that, and then tracks. So all of these pages are exploring that a bit more. I like this one where it's going to be a bunch of flowers in the field as they're checking the bark on a tree and being like, "Oh, a scratch, a dragon has been here."</p>

<p>Sometimes I note costuming elements I really like. For example, I really like this sleeve, I don't really care about the rest of the drawing, but I wanted to remind myself that I like this sleeve.</p>

<p><strong>Do I often pull from reference in any way?</strong></p>

<p>I do, yeah. I pull from reference all the time. I love looking at museum archives. The <strong>Met</strong> has a great one where you can just sort through whatever category. I love seeing beautiful puffy sleeves.</p>

<p>This is not something I'm doing, but I was like, if I did a blind box, what would it look like?</p>

<p>I had a graphic novel coming out, so I was brainstorming little countdown illustrations. I did more of that in a different book.</p>

<p>On this page, I was thinking I would like to do an <strong>East of the Sun, West of the Moon</strong> series at some point. So this was where she went to the castle and saw a big feast with the bear.</p>

<p>Here's a little goofy guy, he's a <strong>werewolf</strong>. Here he is again, we can't get away from him. This character is from a pitch for a children's book series that I'm working on right now with my agent. One of the ideas I had was that the main characters meet a werewolf at some point, and the werewolf himself is very nervous and not threatening at all. He's very sweaty, which I can relate to.</p>

<p>This was brainstorming for a series of <strong>faun illustrations</strong> that I haven't done yet. I was going to do them for Gen Con and I ran out of time. Maybe next year.</p>

<p>Some <strong>mermaid</strong> sketches.</p>

<p>One of my favorite pieces that I've done is of a woman holding a hunting horn and blowing on it, and then there's a bunch of hounds that are coming. So I want to do a complementary piece where someone's blowing a horn but it's a bunch of <strong>falcons</strong>, and they're doing a similar almost Escher-esque pattern rather than them being literal. The other piece is very orange with a little bit of blue, so I think it would be the other way around.</p>

<p><strong>You've used a couple different pens of different colors. Does that denote anything for your shorthand or is it just splitting the composition?</strong></p>

<p>It denotes when my pen has run out of ink, to be honest. Sometimes I do it just to help myself get a sense of space and read the thumbnail a little bit more cleanly. So for this one, I felt the need to add a little bit of darkness at the back. But for the most part, it might denote value like this, but otherwise I just sort of use one pen until it's dead.</p>

<p><strong>Do I have a preferred ballpoint pen?</strong></p>

<p>Oh yeah, they're pretty standard, they're Bic. Yeah, those are the ones I use. I really, really like how they draw.</p>

<p>I used to dance when I was growing up. I did ballet from like 5 to 18, so I like the idea of doing a <strong>ballet piece</strong>.</p>

<p>I was brainstorming stuff for <strong>Swordtember</strong>, which if you're aware of it, it's an annual sword drawing challenge in September. It's very casual, and this past year I was thinking about doing big landscape paintings, and I was like, "Who am I kidding?" and I just did a couple of pieces this year.</p>

<p>So this has been my thinking sketchbook.</p>

<h2>My Travel Sketchbook</h2>

<p>This one is decorated with stickers, I got them in Japan. This one's my favorite, it's so cute. I have some on the back too.</p>

<p>These are drawn both from life and some of them are drawn from photos later.</p>

<p>These were all drawn from life. Basically, as soon as I got to Tokyo, I went to a <strong>cat cafe</strong> because we couldn't check in to our hotel yet. I hung out there for a little while and I just drew some cats.</p>

<p>As a background designer for animation, I love drawing <strong>trees</strong> a lot more than most people. So I have a few drawings of trees here, different views that I saw while I was traveling.</p>

<p>There's a bridge that was in <strong>Nikko</strong>, and I got a stamp at the train station, which I thought was fun.</p>

<p>There's a lot of <strong>food drawings</strong> here as well. So here's some <strong>pancakes</strong> that I got.</p>

<p>This is my <strong>Yokohama</strong> spread. We went to Yokohama, and then after the fact, I took some pictures, and then I drew from the pictures. The <strong>Chinatown</strong> there was really beautiful, and we were supposed to go see the <strong>Gundam</strong>, the big Gundam that walks, but we got there too late and it closed.</p>

<p>This is from a park in <strong>Osaka</strong>. This was drawn from life, so I was standing there drawing. I really like drawing from life while I'm traveling because I can physically recall a lot of what was going on while I'm there. I'll look at this drawing and be like, "Oh, I remember it was a really nice temperature." This is more precious now.</p>

<p>Here's the various <strong>meals spread</strong>. My favorite has to be the <strong>Minions churro</strong> that I had, followed by the <strong>Final Fantasy Cafe</strong> fries and drink that I got. The fries were called <strong>Cheesy Potato Explosion of Despair</strong> on the menu, so I had to get it. It did not disappoint.</p>

<p>This was another one where I really remember, sensory-wise, what was going on. It was getting a little dark and it was starting to get cold. My fingertips were a little cold while I was drawing this, but it was very peaceful. It was a really nice night.</p>

<p>The next few pages are the <strong>Fushimi Inari Shrine</strong>. As I was going up, if you're familiar, it's like a ton of stairs. It takes about an hour and a half to get around. You get kind of sweaty. So I gave myself the excuse of stopping to draw, and I was like, "Oh, it's for my sketchbook." So you can see how often I stopped here.</p>

<p>This is also there.</p>

<p>And then afterwards, I drew from my photos that I took of all these amazing <strong>statues</strong> that I saw while I was going up and down. I really like the <strong>frogs</strong> too.</p>

<p>Oh, I went to, you guys might have heard about this place from Instagram, but I went to the <strong>Muscle Girl Bar</strong>. I'm quite awkward. I didn't realize it was going to be very one-on-one, where you sit directly across from a very nice and very muscular woman. So I asked at one point if she'd want to pose for me, and she did, and it was really fun. So I did some gesture drawings while I was there. The manager came over and wanted to do some posing also.</p>

<p>As a side note, they gave you a very, very large tankard, but I wasn't drinking at the time, so I got <strong>grapefruit juice</strong> and I was just sitting with a huge tankard of grapefruit juice.</p>

<p>This was drawn in <strong>Yoyogi Park</strong>, as was this. The <strong>ginkgo trees</strong> were bright yellow, and in the distance, you could just see a wall of yellow, and it was so beautiful. And then this was just at a coffee shop that was close by.</p>

<p>And this is the last spread. I wanted to capture the fact that I traveled a lot on <strong>trains</strong>, so I just worked from a train station picture that I took, and I drew another small shrine that I saw when I was in Nikko.</p>

<p><strong>How did my trip inspire what I want to draw in the future?</strong></p>

<p>Oh, that's a really good question. I was very inspired by the colors, even just seeing that intense yellow in the far back there. I was trying to capture it, and I was like, "It's so cool that these colors exist in nature, that you can just see something really bright and wonderful."</p>

<p>And then also, from a background design standpoint, I love the <strong>architecture of cities in Japan</strong>. I'm a complete nerd for like those <strong>micro tiles</strong> that you see in Japan but not in America. I love the sort of kinetic energy you get from <strong>exposed staircases on the sides of buildings</strong>, which they have a lot of in Japan. They have a lot in Los Angeles too, but it's a little bit different there.</p>

<p>Thank you!</p>
