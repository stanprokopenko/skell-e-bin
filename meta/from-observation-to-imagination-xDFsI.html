<h2>Finding Inspiration in Everyday Life</h2>

<p>I wanted to create an illustration featuring AC units as background elements. But I needed a focal point, something that stands out as the main character. Looking through photos, I found pictures of my son, about nine months old at the time. His adorable shapes and features inspired me to incorporate them into my work.</p>

<h2>Studying My Son's Face</h2>

<p>Captivated by the unique shape of his cheeks, I decided to study his face, focusing on ratios and proportions.</p>

<h3>Observing Ratios and Proportions</h3>

<p>I noticed his <strong>eyeline</strong> is almost at the midpoint of his face, unlike older children or adults. Measuring with my hands, I observed that the forehead to cheek ratio is nearly one-to-one before tapering to the chin. His cheeks have a mirroring bulge, creating a distinctive and cute facial structure.</p>

<p>Details like the small size of his mouth, about the same width as his eye, and his hairline following the planes of his head enhanced my understanding of a baby's facial anatomy.</p>

<h2>Using Facial Features to Define Planes</h2>

<p>I like to use <strong>eyebrows</strong> to define the front plane of the face, rather than drawing straight guidelines. It indicates direction and adds character. Similarly, I use the placement of the <strong>ears</strong> to define the side planes. Knowing the ears align with the side of the head helps in constructing an accurate head shape.</p>

<h2>Studying the Hat</h2>

<p>In another photo, my son wears a hat he didn't particularly like, but I found it amusing. I decided to study its shape and structure.</p>

<h3>Breaking Down the Hat's Structure</h3>

<p>The hat follows the same shape as his head but is slightly larger for thickness. It has a small rounded cone at the top and cute ears that are rounded cylinders connected toward the back. A strap with a button in the front adds to its charm.</p>

<h2>Applying the Study to Creative Design</h2>

<p>Having studied the hat, I thought about incorporating its design into new creations.</p>

<h3>Transforming the Hat into New Ideas</h3>

<p>I imagined turning the hat into a whimsical airplane, with the ears flapping. Borrowing elements from other studies, like vehicles with wheels, I designed a playful ship.</p>

<p>I also considered placing the hat on different characters, even adults. Understanding the shape, I adjusted it to fit various poses and designs. I played with the idea of a gritty story where the character wears this unexpectedly cute hat, adding contrast.</p>

<h2>Embracing Playfulness in Design</h2>

<p>Through this process, I realized that studying and understanding shapes allows me to create more freely. It reminds me of my work on "Sea of Stars," where the director appreciated my fun and silly designs. The more I enjoyed the process, the more appealing the outcomes.</p>

<h2>Integrating Story and Design</h2>

<p>As I draw and play with these concepts, the story often unfolds naturally. Designing the character leads me to think about their purpose, environment, and how their appearance serves their role. Connecting design and narrative helps me create cohesive and compelling characters.</p>

<p>Studying real-life references and breaking down shapes and proportions is essential to my creative process. It enhances my understanding of anatomy and fuels my imagination, allowing me to create characters and stories that resonate with others.</p>
