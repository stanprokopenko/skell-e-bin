<p>I've been reviewing your assignments, and there's some great work, <strong>100%</strong>. This week, we are dealing with a unique situation. In the upcoming video, I'll be drawing through many of these difficult poses. You'll get a chance to watch me tackle the same references you've been working on. You'll see how I solve them, and compare that to your own approach.</p>

<p>With that in mind, I want to use this critique to speak more generally about things that are still problematic or areas where I see room for improvement. There are common questions and challenges that arise around this stage in our study of gesture, and I'd like to address them to help you develop further.</p>

<h2>Common Challenges in Gesture Drawing</h2>

<h3>Avoiding Symmetry</h3>

<p>One of the biggest issues that still comes up is <strong>creating symmetry</strong> in your drawings. When we get into more difficult poses, it's challenging not to fall back into symmetrical shapes. I noticed that many submissions, especially in areas like the neck or torso, still emphasize symmetry.</p>

<p>In gesture drawing, we're striving for <strong>asymmetry</strong>. We want to capture the natural flow and movement of the figure, which is inherently asymmetrical. Symmetry can make your drawings feel stiff and static. Instead, focus on finding the <strong>pinches and stretches</strong> in the body, the <strong>contrasts between active and passive sides</strong>.</p>

<h3>Thinking Beyond Contour</h3>

<p>Another common tendency is to revert back to outlines and contours too early. While contours are important, in gesture drawing we want to avoid getting locked into the <strong>shape</strong> of the figure too soon. Instead, we're looking for the <strong>continuity, movement, and flow</strong> that comes from abstracting the figure into rhythms and gestures.</p>

<p>We're not drawing the <strong>subject</strong>, we're drawing an <strong>idea</strong> about what we see. This means embracing the abstract nature of gesture drawing and not getting bogged down in the outlines or specific details of the figure at this stage.</p>

<h2>Planning for the Next Steps</h2>

<h3>Understanding Your Goals</h3>

<p>A good question to ask yourself is: <strong>What are you planning to do with your gesture drawings?</strong> Understanding your ultimate goal will help you tailor your approach. Not everyoneâ€™s goal is the same.</p>

<p>For example, if you're interested in <strong>storyboarding</strong>, your focus might be on conveying body language and psychology quickly without needing detailed rendering. On the other hand, if you're aiming for <strong>photorealism</strong>, your process will involve building up detailed anatomy and light.</p>

<p>Gesture is the start, the foundation. Knowing where you want to go allows you to plan your process accordingly.</p>

<h3>Developing a Process</h3>

<p>Having a <strong>process</strong> is crucial. It helps you understand what steps to take and where you might need to improve. Here's how I approach drawing:</p>

<ol>

<li><strong>Gesture:</strong> Capture the most important themes and the overall movement.</li>

<li><strong>Connections:</strong> Build connections between parts of the body.</li>

<li><strong>Landmarks:</strong> Identify the main skeletal points that push through the skin.</li>

<li><strong>Perspective Construction:</strong> Visualize the figure as a series of boxes, cylinders, or planes.</li>

<li><strong>Anatomy:</strong> Add muscles on top of your construction.</li>

<li><strong>Light and Drapery:</strong> Incorporate light or drapery to develop your drawing further.</li>

</ol>

<p>Each stage builds upon the previous one. This process might be different for you depending on your goals, and that's okay. The key is to have a clear path that leads you to your desired outcome.</p>

<h2>The Stages of Drawing</h2>

<h3>Gesture</h3>

<p>Gesture is about capturing the <strong>most important themes</strong> of the pose, the overall movement, action, and flow. It's an <strong>abstract</strong>, open-ended interpretation of the figure. At this stage, we're not concerned with details or outlines, we're focusing on the <strong>big picture</strong>.</p>

<h3>Connections</h3>

<p>After laying down the gesture, I focus on <strong>connecting</strong> the parts of the body. These connections often involve <strong>wraps and overlaps</strong>, helping to convey the three-dimensional form of the figure. The lines used here are <strong>S-curves</strong> and <strong>C-curves</strong>, similar to those used in gesture, but they start to define the relationships between forms.</p>

<h3>Landmarks</h3>

<p>Next, I identify <strong>landmarks</strong>, the main skeletal points that are visible on the surface. These include areas like the clavicle, sternum, rib cage, pelvis, and major joints. Recognizing these landmarks helps in understanding the <strong>structure</strong>, and aids in the <strong>construction</strong> of the figure.</p>

<h3>Perspective Construction</h3>

<p>With the landmarks in place, I begin the <strong>perspective construction</strong>. This involves visualizing the figure as a series of <strong>boxes and cylinders</strong>, or <strong>planes</strong>. By mapping out these basic forms, I can understand the figure in three-dimensional space. This step is essential for creating a sense of volume and depth.</p>

<h3>Anatomy</h3>

<p>Once the structure is established, I start adding <strong>anatomy</strong>, the muscles and forms that build upon the basic shapes. Each muscle is considered in relation to the underlying structure and the gesture. This helps in creating a figure that not only looks correct, but also conveys the <strong>movement and dynamics</strong> of the pose.</p>

<h3>Light and Drapery</h3>

<p>The final stage involves adding <strong>light</strong> and, if applicable, <strong>drapery</strong>. Understanding how light interacts with the surfaces and forms you've constructed is key to rendering. The muscles and forms you've built up help in determining where the light and shadows fall.</p>

<h2>Applying the Process to a Pose</h2>

<p>Let's walk through how this process applies to a specific pose.</p>

<p>First, I start with the <strong>gesture</strong>, capturing the overall movement and flow of the figure. For instance, if the figure is stretching upward, I might use a long, sweeping line to convey that.</p>

<p>Next, I establish the <strong>tilts</strong> of the rib cage and pelvis, noting the angles at which they're positioned. This helps in visualizing the figure's <strong>orientation</strong> in space.</p>

<p>I then draw the <strong>shapes</strong> of the rib cage and pelvis, using simple forms like ellipses and boxes. The <strong>connections</strong> are added, using S- and C-curves to represent how the neck connects to the rib cage and how the torso connects to the pelvis.</p>

<p>After that, I plot the <strong>landmarks</strong>, such as the clavicle, sternum, and hip bones. These points help in constructing the <strong>perspective</strong> boxes around the rib cage and pelvis, solidifying their three-dimensional forms.</p>

<p>With the structure in place, I start adding <strong>muscles</strong>, considering how they wrap around the shapes and connect at the landmarks. At this stage, I'm thinking about how each muscle contributes to the overall gesture and movement.</p>

<p>Finally, I consider the <strong>lighting</strong>, thinking about how the forms I've created would interact with light, where the highlights and shadows would fall.</p>

<h2>Contour and Asymmetry</h2>

<p>It's important to remember that <strong>contour is gesture</strong>. The contours of the body are not just outlines, they're the result of the asymmetrical forms underneath. Muscles are <strong>micro arguments for the larger gesture</strong>. By understanding the asymmetry present in muscles and forms, we can create contours that convey the dynamics of the pose.</p>

<p>When adding contours, think about the <strong>pinches and stretches</strong>, and how the active and passive sides of the body relate. Each muscle has its own gesture, contributing to the overall flow of the figure.</p>

<h2>Proportions and Foreshortening</h2>

<p>Watch out for <strong>proportion issues</strong>, especially with <strong>head size</strong> relative to the body. A common tendency is to make limbs too long when they're foreshortened. Remember, when something is coming toward you or moving away, you need to <strong>shorten</strong> it in your drawing, not lengthen it.</p>

<p>Using techniques like <strong>wrapping lines</strong> can help convey the direction and foreshortening of forms. These lines wrap around the forms, indicating whether they're coming toward us or receding.</p>

<h2>Transitions and Connections</h2>

<p>Pay attention to the <strong>transitions</strong> between parts of the figure. The way one form flows into another is crucial for creating a sense of unity and movement. Use <strong>longer rhythms</strong> where appropriate, connecting parts of the body with sweeping lines.</p>

<p>Avoid segmenting the figure into disconnected parts. Instead, think about <strong>how the energy moves</strong> through the body, from the head down to the feet.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p>Gesture drawing is the <strong>beginning</strong> of your drawing process. It's about capturing the <strong>essence</strong> of the pose, the movement, and the energy. By understanding how to build upon your gesture through connections, landmarks, construction, and anatomy, you set yourself up for success in your final drawing.</p>

<p>Remember, this process is a <strong>tool</strong>. You can adjust it to suit your own goals and style. The key is to have a clear understanding of <strong>what you want to achieve</strong> and to develop a process that helps you get there.</p>

<p>Keep practicing, stay mindful of these concepts, and you'll continue to improve. Great work on your assignments, and I look forward to seeing your progress in the upcoming lessons.</p>
