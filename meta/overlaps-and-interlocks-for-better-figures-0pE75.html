<p>You can connect forms in a figure drawing with <strong>simple curves and corners</strong>. When two forms follow the same general direction (like the hips and the rib cage), connect them with a curve or S-curve. When they go in very different directions (like shoulders to upper arms), use more angular corners.</p>

<p>This foundation leads to more sophisticated connective strategies: <strong>beanbags and drumsticks</strong>. These methods help you create <strong>overlaps</strong> and <strong>interlocks</strong> that add dimensionality to your figures.</p>

<h2>Beanbags</h2>

<p>A beanbag approach treats multiple structures as if they are inside a soft bag or sock. Two or more shapes blend on one side and separate on the other. This blending creates natural <strong>overlaps</strong>, which is an excellent way to show volume and depth. You see which form is in front, and you also see how forms relate to each other in space.</p>

<h2>Drumsticks</h2>

<p>Drumsticks allow for both <strong>overlaps and interlocks</strong>. Imagine one ball-shaped form in front of another, then a tube-like form intrudes into the ball. Parts of that tube’s sides break the ball’s contour, making the forms look locked together. This interlock (like a “key in a lock”) goes beyond a simple overlap by clearly showing which part of the form is closer and how deeply one shape inserts into another.</p>

<h2>Applying to Torsos</h2>

<p>You can use these strategies on torsos to visualize the relationship of the rib cage, waist, and hips:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Curves:</strong> When parts of the torso align in a similar direction, link them with a curve.  </li>

<li><strong>Corners:</strong> If parts of the torso drastically change direction (like shoulders to upper arms), connect them with corners.  </li>

<li><strong>Beanbags and Drumsticks:</strong> When you have deeper perspective or more complex overlaps (like a strongly foreshortened torso), use beanbags or drumsticks.  </li>

</ul>

<h3>Examples in Perspective</h3>

<p>• When the rib cage appears much closer than the hips, you get a <strong>dramatic overlap</strong>. A large egg shape in the foreground (rib cage) can overlap a smaller egg shape in the background (hips).<br />

• For <strong>interlocks</strong>, let a tube-like waist or abdomen intrude into the pelvic form. You might only interlock on one side, asymmetrically, to suggest a twist or curve in the body.</p>

<h3>Male vs. Female Emphasis</h3>

<p>• <strong>Male figures:</strong> Often top-heavy with broad shoulders and a narrower waist. You can emphasize the chest or shoulders as a drumstick shape that interlocks with the abdomen or hips.<br />

• <strong>Female figures:</strong> Often bottom-heavy, so the beanbag or drumstick effect is even clearer around the hips and waist. This helps show how the fuller hips overlap or interlock with a smaller rib cage.</p>

<h2>Practice and Observation</h2>

<p>When you <strong>draw from reference</strong> or study other artists, look for these connective strategies. Many classic illustrators use the principle of drumsticks and beanbags without calling it by name. For example, fantasy illustrator Frank Frazetta often depicts women with strong drumstick forms. George Bridgman explored figure architecture with similar ideas in his books.</p>

<p>To build confidence, practice with simple overlapping shapes in shallow perspectives. Then progress to deeper perspectives that call for interlocks. Even if you only add a slight overlap, you’ll begin to see how each main form relates and locks together.</p>
