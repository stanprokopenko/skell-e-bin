<h2>Separating Plan and Projection</h2>

<p>To create a <strong>plan projection</strong>, I start by separating it into two parts: <strong>the plan</strong> and <strong>the projection</strong>.</p>

<h2>Drawing the Plan</h2>

<p>First, I draw what's going to be a <strong>window</strong> from a top view, giving it a little thickness to represent its form. Then, I place a <strong>perfect square</strong> within this window. The four corners of this square are crucial, so I make sure to clearly mark their positions.</p>

<h2>Placing the Viewer</h2>

<p>Next, I position the <strong>viewer</strong> on the plan. I can place the viewer up close or further back, in this instance, I place the viewer pretty close, right here. I establish the <strong>center of vision</strong>, which goes right there. Within a <strong>60-degree angle</strong> or less from that center, the viewer can see each corner of the square.</p>

<h2>Establishing Vanishing Points</h2>

<p>I draw lines from each corner of the square to the viewer's eye, like <strong>light beams</strong>. These lines intersect the <strong>picture plane</strong>, which is in front of the viewer. </p>

<p>To find the <strong>vanishing points</strong> for the width and depth, I draw lines parallel to the object's sides from the viewer's eye. Where these lines intersect the picture plane are the vanishing points for those parallel lines.</p>

<h2>Projecting to the Elevation</h2>

<p>I then <strong>drop</strong> the points where the corner lines intersect the picture plane down to create perfectly vertical lines. Before transferring them, I establish the <strong>horizon line</strong> in the elevation view. Dropping the vanishing points down to this horizon line, I use them to draw lines from the corners, defining the object's sides in perspective.</p>

<h2>Adjusting the Height</h2>

<p>To define the object's height, I transfer the non-foreshortened height from the plan to the elevation. Drawing vertical lines up to this height, I connect the dots to form the object's shape in perspective.</p>

<p>If I decide to change the height, perhaps making it a <strong>stack of boxes</strong> with space in between, I transfer this new height level and repeat the process, connecting the corners to the vanishing points accordingly.</p>

<h2>Finalizing the Projection</h2>

<p>By connecting all the lines and adjusting as needed, I complete the <strong>plan projection</strong>. This method demonstrates how the plan and elevation work together to create an accurate perspective drawing.</p>

<p>Understanding this process, even if I seldom use it, helps me appreciate how much goes on behind the scenes in 3D modeling. The plan is the top view, the elevation is the side view, and this is the <strong>projection</strong>.</p>
