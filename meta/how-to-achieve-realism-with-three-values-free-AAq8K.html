<h2>What's in Premium?</h2>

<p>Learn to create realistic paintings using just <strong>three values</strong>: white, mid-value, and black. This lesson teaches you how to simplify complex subjects by converting reference photos to black and white and reducing them to three distinct values using Photoshop. You'll master mixing your paints to match these values and apply them effectively in your artwork. The step-by-step process covers painting mid-values, adding darks, and incorporating final touches like highlights and shadows. By following this method, you'll have a reliable blueprint for achieving realism in your paintings.</p>
