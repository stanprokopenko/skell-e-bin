<p>I like to think of this exercise as a quick way to explore shapes and shading. I grab a pencil (or whatever tool I’m using) and craft little <strong>blobs</strong>. I try to keep them organic, combining circles, ellipses, curves, and even boxy edges. The goal is to practice shaping forms, lighting them from different directions, and building confidence with <strong>edges</strong>.  </p>

<h2>Building Basic Forms</h2>

<p>I usually begin by sketching a simple outline of a blob. It might start as a curvy bean shape, a blob with two bulbous ends, or a squarish form connected to a rounded mass. I focus on making it look organic by varying the dimensions and contour. There’s no single correct starting shape, any blob is fair game.</p>

<h2>Adding Light and Shadows</h2>

<p>Once I have my blob, I decide where the light is coming from. I often imagine a basic top-left light source, but sometimes I place the light behind the object for variety. From there:<br />

- I fill in <strong>shadow areas</strong> where the form curves away from the light.<br />

- I pay attention to any cast shadow if one part of the blob might block light onto another part.<br />

- I think about a simple <strong>core shadow</strong> and soften or firm up the edges around it.</p>

<h3>Key Edges</h3>

<p>Edges help me describe how the form is turning. I like to mix:<br />

- <strong>Sharp edges</strong>: Sudden plane changes or where the form overlaps another part of the blob.<br />

- <strong>Firm edges</strong>: Transitions that aren’t razor-sharp but still clearly indicate a turn in the surface.<br />

- <strong>Soft edges</strong>: Smooth, gradual transitions that help the blob look round and organic.  </p>

<h3>Halftones</h3>

<p>Halftones appear between the lit surface and the dark core shadow. I add a <strong>soft gradation</strong> if the form is smoothly curving. If it’s a firmer turn, I keep that middle value more abrupt. Sometimes I skip halftones to focus on the main shapes of the shading.</p>

<h2>Speed Drills</h2>

<p>To keep it fun, I time myself. I might give myself five minutes to resolve each blob, or even just two minutes for a quick challenge. Speed forces me to make clear decisions and stay loose. The results may not be perfect, but these quick drills build skill and confidence.</p>

<h2>Practice and Repetition</h2>

<p>Honestly, the real benefit is in <strong>repetition</strong>. Trying different light sources, practicing a wide range of edges, and mixing shapes is how I hone this technique. I see this as a great warm-up before diving into more complex drawings, like portraits or full scenes. It loosens my hand and mind, it encourages more inventive shapes, and lets me explore <strong>edge variety</strong> without stress.</p>

<p>That’s it! They’re just blobs, but they’re an excellent way to master shading and build up my skill set.</p>
