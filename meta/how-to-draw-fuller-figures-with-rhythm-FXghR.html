<p>Welcome back! Today, let's <strong>shape-shift some figures</strong> and draw a fuller figure to <strong>feel the gravity of these marvelous shapes</strong>. Bringing <strong>life into dirty marks on paper</strong> is remarkable, and we should celebrate it. As we progress, I'll offer some <strong>portfolio advice</strong>, though if you're a professional artist, you might be doing this just for the love of it, which is the ultimate goal.</p>

<p>Remember, the main thing is to <strong>enjoy the process</strong>, including the wonderful mistakes, or "clangers." If you create a bad drawing, <strong>celebrate it</strong>. You'll be surprised how much fun it is to acknowledge every misstep. Bad drawings teach us as much, if not more, than good drawings. Don't be afraid to fall over, it's just a way to get back up easier and faster.</p>

<h2>Drawing Fuller Figures</h2>

<h3>Starting with the Framework</h3>

<p>Anyone can draw a simple <strong>balloon on a stick</strong>, but today, we want to create a character with more volume, a figure that embodies that delightful feeling of <strong>gravity</strong>. Begin by setting up the <strong>framework</strong> - </p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Shoulders and hips</strong>: On a woman, the shoulders and hips are generally the same distance apart.</li>

<li><strong>Clavicles and humerus</strong>: Mark the clavicles and the ball of the humerus.</li>

<li><strong>Great trochanter</strong>: This aligns at the bottom and doesn't change, even with added weight.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Understanding Weight Distribution</h3>

<p>As a woman gains weight, it generally goes <strong>below the waist first</strong>. It takes longer to travel up to the stomach and breasts. So, when drawing a fuller figure, <strong>push those hips out</strong> due to the muscle and subcutaneous layers on top.</p>

<h3>Feeling the Roundness and Volume</h3>

<p>Focus on <strong>feeling the runs and the roundness</strong>. We're <strong>feeling things</strong>, not just drawing them. If you're not feeling what you draw, your mind might wander, and as Leonardo da Vinci said, you'll be <strong>at sea without a rudder</strong> without at least a germ of an idea or emotion.</p>

<h3>Imbuing Emotion into Your Drawings</h3>

<p>Treat the body as a <strong>story</strong>. This story is all about <strong>weight and volume</strong>. Within that story, feel all the volume and interaction. For this drawing, perhaps think of a <strong>joyful pose</strong>, a sprite dancing through the hills and valleys of a fantasy kingdom. <strong>Imbue every pose with emotional authority</strong>.</p>

<h2>Method Drawing and Emotional Authority</h2>

<h3>Feeling the Emotion</h3>

<p>Like the Disney artists who pulled faces in mirrors to capture emotions, you should feel the happiness or sadness in your drawings. An actor might make themselves cry by believing they are the character, this is called <strong>method acting</strong>. Similarly, think of this as <strong>method drawing</strong>.</p>

<h3>Themes and Stories</h3>

<p>Give yourself <strong>themes</strong> in your work. For instance, a theme of <strong>roundness and joy</strong> can already affect your drawing because you're happy to draw a happy figure. Think of the figure as <strong>filled with life and cheekiness</strong>.</p>

<h2>Anatomy Notes</h2>

<h3>Breasts and Gravity</h3>

<p>When drawing larger breasts, remember they <strong>move to the side and downwards</strong> due to gravity. They can shift positions significantly, with nipples sometimes appearing much lower than the center line. Breasts are <strong>very shifty</strong> and change shape a lot.</p>

<h3>Bones Always Make Themselves Known</h3>

<p>No matter the volume added around them, <strong>bones always make themselves known</strong>. For example:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Knees</strong>: The bones are prominent, even with added volume.</li>

<li><strong>Stomach and Breasts</strong>: They can extend beyond other bones due to subcutaneous layers.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Drawing Hands</h2>

<h3>The Extended Hand</h3>

<p>When drawing an extended hand, consider that <strong>everything's halved</strong>:</p>

<ul>

<li>From the wrist to the first big joint is half the length.</li>

<li>Break down each segment into halves or quarters as needed.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Fingers and Webbing</h3>

<ul>

<li><strong>Fingers</strong>: On the face of the hand (the top), fingers seem longer because the webbing is higher on the inside.</li>

<li><strong>Webbing</strong>: The webbing is high on the inside of the hand, fingers extend past it on the outside.</li>

</ul>

<h3>The Thumb and Elegance</h3>

<p>The <strong>little finger</strong> is a maverick, pushing into the hypothenar eminence. Extending it can make any hand look elegant, especially in feminine poses.</p>

<h3>Tips for Drawing Hands</h3>

<ul>

<li><strong>Practice with Extended Fingers</strong>: It's common in dynamic poses (think Doctor Strange casting spells).</li>

<li><strong>Hand Positions</strong>: Hands can be tricky, so keep it simple and use sticks as an idea for the rhythm.</li>

<li><strong>Variation</strong>: Sometimes, not all fingers are visible. It's acceptable to show only three fingers if necessary.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Portfolio Advice</h2>

<h3>Show Your Best Work</h3>

<p>When building a portfolio, <strong>only include your strongest pieces</strong>. You're <strong>only as strong as your weakest link</strong>, and art directors will notice any weak work. Avoid including pieces you're hoping might turn heads if they're not your best.</p>

<h3>The First Impression Counts</h3>

<p>Art directors often know <strong>on the first piece</strong> whether they're interested. They might not need to see more than <strong>12 pieces maximum</strong>. So, think of your portfolio like <strong>fence posts</strong>:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>First Piece</strong>: Very strong to capture attention.</li>

<li><strong>Middle Pieces</strong>: Maintain strength throughout.</li>

<li><strong>Last Piece</strong>: The strongest to leave a lasting impression.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Avoid Student Work</h3>

<p>Don't include sketches or work from art college in your professional portfolio. It might give the impression that you're still in college.</p>

<h3>Consistency is Key</h3>

<p>Art directors want to see that you can <strong>deliver on the promise of your portfolio</strong>. Make sure your least impressive artwork is still <strong>commission-worthy</strong>.</p>

<h2>Motor Function and Practice</h2>

<h3>Muscle Memory</h3>

<p>You might know what you want to draw, but your hand won't do it, that's where <strong>motor memory</strong> comes in. To improve - </p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Draw frequently</strong> to hone your motor functions.</li>

<li><strong>Practice makes permanent</strong> , the more you draw, the better your muscle memory becomes.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Repetition is Essential</h3>

<p>We're <strong>honing both the mnemonics and the motor function</strong>, so draw one after another to feed both ideas. Even if you're doing different drawings each time, <strong>repetition strengthens your skills</strong>.</p>

<h2>On Distractions and Focus</h2>

<h3>Compartmentalize Tasks</h3>

<p>To maintain focus:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Schedule tasks</strong> like taxes or administrative work for specific times.</li>

<li><strong>When drawing</strong>, focus solely on drawing. Don't let extraneous thoughts intrude.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Staying in the Moment</h3>

<p>Avoid thinking about unrelated tasks while drawing. <strong>Compartmentalizing</strong> helps keep your mind clear and your creativity flowing.</p>

<h2>Learning from Others</h2>

<h3>Life Lessons</h3>

<p>Everyone can teach you something. Whether it's a colleague, a friend, or even someone you meet by chance, be open to learning.</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Earn Your Lunch</strong>: A friend once said, "I always earn my lunch," highlighting the value of working for your rewards.</li>

<li><strong>Learning from All Walks of Life</strong>: Even if you work on Wall Street and find yourself in a tough spot, someone with different experiences might offer valuable insights.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Philosophical Insights</h3>

<p>Diving into the <strong>philosophy and emotion</strong> behind art can inspire and enhance your work. Consider taking courses that explore these aspects, not just technical skills.</p>

<h2>Exercise and Cognitive Function</h2>

<h3>The Importance of Physical Activity</h3>

<p>As artists, we're often sedentary, so <strong>exercise is crucial</strong>. Physical activity:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Enhances cognitive function</strong>, including strengthening the hippocampus.</li>

<li><strong>Keeps you healthy</strong>, balancing the sedentary nature of drawing.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Making Time for Exercise</h3>

<ul>

<li><strong>Schedule regular exercise</strong> into your day.</li>

<li>Even simple activities, like using an exercise bike or going for a walk, can make a difference.</li>

</ul>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p>The more you draw, <strong>the better your drawings become</strong>. Indulge in your passion, set aside time, and <strong>draw with all the wonder in the world in your heart</strong>. Remember to enjoy every moment, learn from your mistakes, and keep pushing forward.</p>
