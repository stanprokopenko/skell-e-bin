<p>Adding <strong>values</strong> to your line drawings transforms them, creating the illusion of three-dimensional form. While lines are great, values take your art to the next level.</p>

<h2>What Is Value in Art?</h2>

<p>In art, <strong>value</strong> refers to how light or dark something is, not its monetary worth. For example, in a grayscale image, skin might appear lighter than lips, even if their actual colors differ.</p>

<h2>From Lines to Shapes Filled with Color</h2>

<p>In reality, you don't see lines, you see shapes filled with colors. <strong>Color</strong> consists of three properties</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Hue</strong>: The color family (red, blue, yellow).</li>

<li><strong>Chroma</strong>: How pure or gray the color is.</li>

<li><strong>Value</strong>: How light or dark the color is.</li>

</ul>

<p>As an artist, <strong>value is the most important</strong> of these. Focusing on value helps you create depth and form.</p>

<h2>The Importance of Value</h2>

<p>Think of lines as the framework of a building, and <strong>values as the walls</strong> that fill in the spaces, making it solid. Values:</p>

<ul>

<li>Create the illusion of <strong>form</strong>, <strong>depth</strong>, and <strong>volume</strong>.</li>

<li>Are essential for realistic drawings.</li>

</ul>

<p>As a beginner, focus on drawing with values before adding color. This approach helps you understand light and form without the complexity of hue and chroma.</p>

<h2>The Value Scale</h2>

<p>Imagine a scale from <strong>0 (black)</strong> to <strong>10 (white)</strong>. This is borrowed from the <strong>Munsell Color System</strong>. Although there are infinite values between black and white, artists simplify this into manageable steps, typically 10.</p>

<p>You don't need to use all 10 values in every drawing. You might:</p>

<ul>

<li>Work with a <strong>limited value range</strong> (e.g., values from 3 to 8).</li>

<li>Choose values from <strong>0 to 5</strong> for a moodier effect.</li>

</ul>

<p>The goal is to <strong>train your eye</strong> to see subtle shifts in value and translate them into your drawings.</p>

<h2>Four Sources of Value</h2>

<p>There are four factors that determine the values you see:</p>

<ol>

<li><strong>Local Value</strong></li>

<li><strong>Light on Form</strong></li>

<li><strong>Surface Material</strong></li>

<li><strong>Atmosphere</strong></li>

</ol>

<p>Focus on the first two for now.</p>

<h3>Local Value</h3>

<p><strong>Local value</strong> is the inherent lightness or darkness of an object, regardless of lighting. For example, <strong>hair</strong> typically has a darker local value than <strong>skin</strong>.</p>

<h3>Light on Form</h3>

<p>When light shines on an object, it affects its value based on the object's form:</p>

<ul>

<li>Planes facing the light are <strong>brighter</strong>.</li>

<li>Planes turning away are <strong>darker</strong>.</li>

</ul>

<p><strong>Local value and light on form work together</strong>. Two objects with different local values will reflect light differently. For example, a red apple and a yellow apple under the same light will have different values on their light and shadow sides.</p>

<p>Understanding and using <strong>values</strong> is crucial for creating realistic and engaging drawings. Practice focusing on value to capture light and form effectively. Before diving into color, mastering value will provide a strong foundation for your art. Get ready to apply these concepts in upcoming exercises and projects!</p>
