<h2>Arms Up in Profile</h2>

<p>When you raise the arms in a profile view, keep focusing on <strong>corners</strong> and <strong>curves</strong>. The torso might lean or tilt, but the strategy remains the same:</p>

<ul>

<li>Visualize <strong>corners</strong> where forms bend sharply.  </li>

<li>Use <strong>curves</strong> or <strong>S-curves</strong> where forms have smoother transitions.  </li>

<li>Mark the <strong>shoulder blade unit</strong> with a simple shape rather than trying to draw the entire shoulders at once.</li>

</ul>

<p>If you can see the shoulder blade clearly, sketch a <strong>small chunk</strong> to represent it. Add overlapping lines or slight curves to show how it sits on top of the back. Sometimes you see extra shading around the shoulder blade, draw it if it helps define the form. Otherwise, keep it simple.</p>

<h2>Simplifying the Torso</h2>

<p>Start with a <strong>basic “T” shape</strong> for the torso:</p>

<ol>

<li>A <strong>shoulder line</strong> across the top.  </li>

<li>A <strong>center line</strong> or vertical axis down the front (or side) of the torso.</li>

</ol>

<p>Then choose a simple form, like an <strong>egg</strong>, <strong>coke-bottle shape</strong>, or <strong>tube</strong>, to represent the rib cage and hips. You might adjust or refine after you lay down the initial lines.</p>

<h2>Corners and Overlapping Forms</h2>

<p>Your main goal is to separate the arm from the torso. Sketch corners or curves where the shoulder meets the arm. You can also use a small <strong>L-shaped</strong> corner to define differences in plane. Sometimes you’ll chisel it or treat it as a smooth transition. Either approach works as long as you show that change clearly.</p>

<h2>Shoulders from the Front View</h2>

<p>Use the same methods with the arms down or up. Place your <strong>shoulder line</strong> and the <strong>center line</strong> of the torso. Identify where the <strong>collarbones</strong> are if they’re visible. They often curve in an <strong>S-shape</strong> from the pit of the neck out to the shoulder.</p>

<p>You also might show a small bump where the collarbone meets the shoulder. If you can’t see a definitive bump, imagine where the collarbones would connect to the arms. That point is your reference for the <strong>top of the shoulder</strong>.</p>

<h2>The Football Player Analogy</h2>

<p>Visualize a set of <strong>football shoulder pads</strong> sitting on top of the rib cage. This helps you see how the chest, shoulders, and armpits wrap around the torso:</p>

<ul>

<li>Imagine a collar opening where the head and neck emerge.  </li>

<li>Sketch the <strong>bottom edge of the chest</strong> or pectoral muscles.  </li>

<li>Identify each <strong>armpit</strong> where the chest ends and the arm begins.  </li>

</ul>

<p>From there, draw a smooth curve (or corner) to show the transition from chest to shoulder, then from shoulder to arm.</p>

<h2>Male and Female Differences</h2>

<p>The <strong>mechanics</strong> and <strong>construction</strong> of the torso and shoulders remain the same for both male and female bodies. The <strong>shape design</strong> can differ, females may have different fat distribution or breast forms, but the basic bones and muscles match. Keep your core structure consistent, and only adjust proportions or surface forms where necessary.</p>

<h2>Quick Sketch Strategies</h2>

<p>In quick drawings (5 to 15 minutes), avoid diving too deeply into details. Block in the <strong>T of the torso</strong>, plus any obvious corners or curves. If you have extra time, refine:</p>

<ul>

<li>Add a hint of the collarbone.  </li>

<li>Indicate major overlaps (armpits, shoulder blades).  </li>

<li>Chisel or curve edges where it helps describe form.  </li>

</ul>

<p>Even a single line for the shoulders and a rough torso shape can be enough to sell the pose. When in doubt, <strong>simplify</strong>. You can always add complexity later if you have more time.</p>

<p>Use these methods to keep your shoulder drawings consistent, clear, and accurate, whether you’re sketching front, back, or profile views with arms up, down, or anywhere in between.</p>
