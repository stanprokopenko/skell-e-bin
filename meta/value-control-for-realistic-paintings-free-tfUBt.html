<h2>What's in Premium?</h2>

<p>In the premium lesson, you'll learn the importance of mastering values in painting, focusing on the lightness and darkness of colors. You'll explore how to use a six-value chart to simplify rendering, with three values each for light and shadow families. The lesson covers maintaining consistency with value families, applying values in portrait painting, and mixing and adjusting values for highlights and halftones. You'll also understand shadows, reflected light, and practice exercises to internalize value separation. Finally, you'll transition to full-color painting and complete a value chart assignment using black and white.</p>
