<h2>Setup and mindset</h2>

<p>I used cool, warm, and red-gray markers plus white, but I stayed focused on <strong>value</strong>, not color. I kept thumbnails <strong>loose</strong> on purpose. Clean drawings make me uptight and less willing to explore. Thumbnails should feel free and fast.</p>

<h2>Value read of the reference</h2>

<p>There’s a bright figure in the middle and a dark background. The top light is cool and the bottom light is warm, but both are <strong>equally bright</strong>. I ignore temperature and judge only by value. I noticed:

- A cast shadow low on the wall (darkest area).

- A subtle <strong>vignette</strong> with darker corners.

- The hat’s top light is very bright.

- Hands are darker in the reference, but I can “cheat” them lighter if I need them to read.</p>

<h2>Shapes and folds</h2>

<p>I mapped a quick figure with a hat and outstretched hands. I simplified folds:

- <strong>Diaper fold</strong> between the shoulders.

- Vertical folds down the sides.

I placed key darks under the jaw, on the chin, and a few fold accents. I kept folds simple and used darks to frame the <strong>head and hands</strong>.</p>

<h2>Three-value thumbnails explored</h2>

<ul>

<li><strong>1) Study the reference as is.</strong> Dark cast shadow at the bottom, light center, and simple fold indications. I kept hands lighter than the reference so they don’t disappear.</li>

<li><strong>2) Full dark background.</strong> A bold two-value silhouette. Then a mid-value interior for hat, face, and drapery. I added darks around the hands and face to pop them. Very strong.</li>

<li><strong>3) Dark only at the top background.</strong> More contrast near the face. I tried hands as bright versus mid. Keeping hands bright worked better unless I pushed more dark around them.</li>

<li><strong>4) Cleaner silhouette with selective darks.</strong> I saved the darkest accents for a few places, made more of the figure <strong>pure light</strong>, and kept hands pure white. The <strong>strong silhouette</strong> improved.</li>

<li><strong>5) Top light as key, bottom glow dimmed.</strong> I lowered the figure to add “air” above for a top glow. I suggested a light shape in the background to justify the extra space.</li>

<li><strong>6) Mixed version with top dark and a mid-value ray.</strong> I didn’t like it as much. The earlier strong version won.</li>

</ul>

<p>I chose the version with a continuous bright shape running up the figure, <strong>hands pure white</strong>, minimal mids, and <strong>selective dark accents</strong> framing the head and shoulders.</p>

<h2>Larger study with 4 values</h2>

<p>I used paper white, a light gray, a darker gray, and black. Marker numbers were reversed from earlier lessons, so I layered to keep the steps clear:

- Blocked in the dark background.

- Kept the <strong>face mostly in shadow</strong> for mystery, with small feature accents.

- Preserved a large, simple light shape through the figure.

- Added a fourth value inside the light to <strong>add detail at the focal point</strong> without blowing it out.

- Layered the darker gray and black to separate close values and popped the corners near the hands with an extra pass of black.

- I avoided a fifth value unless it clearly separated something important.</p>

<h2>Key takeaways</h2>

<ul>

<li>Judge by <strong>value</strong>, not temperature.</li>

<li>A <strong>strong silhouette</strong> beats busy detail.</li>

<li><strong>Connect the light shape</strong> for power, splitting it weakens the read.</li>

<li><strong>Cheat values</strong> to protect important shapes like the hands.</li>

<li>Place contrast near the <strong>focal point</strong> (face and hands).</li>

<li>Start loose, explore many options, then commit to the strongest composition.</li>

</ul>
