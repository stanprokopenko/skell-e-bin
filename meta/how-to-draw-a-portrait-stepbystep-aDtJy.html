<h2>Setting Up the Portrait</h2>

<p>We begin by establishing the <strong>basic structure</strong> of the head. Start with the <strong>initial shape and tilt</strong>, considering the orientation of the jaw and chin. Gesture the neck using a <strong>pinch and stretch</strong> technique. Establish the <strong>brow line</strong> and <strong>center line</strong> as key reference points.</p>

<p>For proportions, think in terms of <strong>halves and thirds</strong>. Mark the hairline and identify the <strong>four points</strong> for the sides of the head:</p>

<ul>

<li>Temple</li>

<li>Hairline</li>

<li>Back of skull</li>

<li>Base of the nose</li>

</ul>

<p>Create a <strong>cutout</strong> for the side of the head, and consider adding a light line for the hair shape.</p>

<h2>Constructing the Head</h2>

<p>Divide the head into quarters and place the <strong>ear</strong> within one of these quarters. For an older subject, the ear might be larger relative to other facial features. From the ear placement, define the <strong>jaw and cheek</strong> on both sides.</p>

<p>Establish the <strong>eye sockets</strong> using the rule of three. Create <strong>forehead planes</strong> that flow up, across, and back down, turning at the corner. Consider how the cheek might overlap behind the brow.</p>

<p>For the <strong>keystone</strong>, transition the brow down into the proportion line. Create a simple box for the nose, which can be customized later.</p>

<h2>Drawing Facial Features</h2>

<h3>Eyes</h3>

<p>Start with the <strong>sphere</strong> of the eye and its attachment points. Consider placing the pupil and iris first to establish gaze direction. Then, add the <strong>eyelid structure</strong>:</p>

<ol>

<li>Top plane</li>

<li>Peak and curve</li>

<li>Connection to socket</li>

</ol>

<p>For an older subject, note the development of the brow ridge and any recession of the eye. Add the lower lid, paying attention to the <strong>box structure</strong> and the transition from hard to soft forms.</p>

<h3>Nose</h3>

<p>Begin with a narrow <strong>nasal saddle</strong>, broadening towards the bottom. Use the center line as a template for the nose's profile. Adjust the planes of your initial box to match the subject's nose shape. Consider the "thought bubble" shape for the nose tip and the turn towards the nostrils.</p>

<h3>Lips</h3>

<p>For older subjects, lips are often thinner. Start with the <strong>philtrum shape</strong>, then create a flatter, less pronounced "M" shape for the upper lip. The lower lip follows with a subtle "W" shape. Ensure the lip corners align roughly with the center of the eyes.</p>

<h3>Cheeks and Jaw</h3>

<p>Define the <strong>cheekbone structure</strong>, noting how it turns and folds. For an older subject, pay attention to how the bone becomes more prominent. The <strong>jaw line</strong> may show signs of sagging or jowl fat. Create a broad, boxy chin structure typical of male subjects.</p>

<h2>Adding Age-Related Details</h2>

<p>Observe and incorporate signs of aging:</p>

<ul>

<li>Changes in <strong>fat distribution</strong></li>

<li><strong>Skin folds</strong> and wrinkles</li>

<li>Increased visibility of <strong>bone structure</strong></li>

<li><strong>Jowl fat</strong> near the jawline</li>

</ul>

<p>These details significantly impact the perceived age of the subject.</p>

<h2>Drawing the Ear</h2>

<p>Place the basic <strong>ear shape</strong>, then look for the five main parts within it. Add the <strong>hook shape</strong> inside for basic structure. For the far ear, a simple silhouette often suffices.</p>

<h2>Final Touches</h2>

<p>Indicate <strong>hair</strong> as a "hat-like" shape wrapping around the head. This stage is suitable for stopping the initial drawing. From here, you could begin adding lighting to enhance the portrait's depth and realism.</p>

<p>Remember, the goal is to transition from these <strong>robotic-feeling forms</strong> to a more lifelike quality. Practice building these structural elements and then adding features to develop your portrait drawing skills.</p>
