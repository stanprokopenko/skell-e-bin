<p>In this video, I want to talk about how academic studying and drawing from reference can enhance your imaginative drawings. I'm using this rustic leather paper I found online called <strong>Leather Village</strong>. It's incredibly cool and has this old-timey feel whenever I draw on it.</p>

<h2>The Importance of Academic Study and Reference</h2>

<p>When I draw, I rely on the information in my head that I've gathered from years of academic study. All the hardcore, focused studying I've done feeds into the stuff I put down on paper. I've watched many lectures and taken classes on concepts like the <strong>"C, S, and I" line principle</strong>, which shows how to draw anything using these simple three sets of lines.</p>

<h2>Applying the "C, S, and I" Line Principle</h2>

<p>Taking something complex like a torso and translating it using the <strong>C, S, and I lines</strong> helps simplify the process. For instance, an arm might be a <strong>C-curve</strong> and two straights. Eventually, you can start adding more complex anatomy, but the simple idea is easy to understand objectively. To start injecting it into your more intuitive drawings, you just need to do a lot of it.</p>

<h2>Embracing Failure and Continuous Practice</h2>

<p>When it comes to drawing, there's often an impulse to want to draw everything well at first. You have this idea in your head of what you want something to look like, and when you can't pull it off, you get disappointed and might give up. The reality of drawing is that <strong>99% of it is going to be a failure</strong>. I have hundreds of these sorts of drawings lying around, me trying something out and failing, or thinking, "Oh, that could have been done better."</p>

<p>The act of trying to make stuff work involves looking at those failures and seeing where you could have done something a little cleaner. Then, for the next time, you incorporate whatever you felt you missed into your drawing.</p>

<h2>Balancing Technical Skill with Playfulness</h2>

<p>In instances like this, I'm drawing something I normally draw a lot. I'm testing something out in the context of being already confident in it. That thing right now is just lines, I've been inking a lot, which is kind of new for me. Trying to juggle doing something complex like telling a story while also getting good line weight is challenging. Those are two almost lifelong studies. Adding another thing on top of that, which I don't have much experience with, is setting myself up for failure a bit.</p>

<h2>Accepting Off Days</h2>

<p>There are days when you're better or worse at something like drawing, even if you've done it for 20,000 or 30,000 hours. There will be days where you feel like you're just picking up a pencil for the first time. I bought 50 sheets of this leather paper, and I suspect I'll be able to get one or two drawings out of this stack that I'll actually like.</p>

<p>I've already done a few experiments that are kind of cool, little head sketches, maybe 5 or 10 minutes each. They're tests and experiments, getting into this stuff, seeing what the medium is like, how the paper reacts, and how my hand moves when I'm using this new material.</p>

<h2>The Value of Experimentation</h2>

<p>A big part of learning how to sketch is the ability to handle failures and experiments. Eventually, you reach a point where your skills are so solid that your baseline, your worst drawing, is better than most people's best drawing.</p>

<p>There's a lot happening in a particular drawing that I might like, and there's stuff I don't like. Maybe the head is funky, or the leg anatomy is weird, but at least you can tell what it is, just a guy standing with his hand up. The goal with some of this stuff is to <strong>learn to draw like a kid again</strong>.</p>

<h2>Learning to Draw Like a Child Again</h2>

<p>There's that quote from Pablo Picasso: "It took me four years to paint like Raphael, but a lifetime to paint like a child." For this kind of stuff, of course, I'm an adult and want to draw well and make representational stuff, but there's a balance. If it's only representational and rigid, it's hard to play. If it's only play, it's hard to make stuff that gets people excited and gets myself excited about it.</p>

<p>The act of drawing and painting doesn't have to be all suffering. The more I've embraced my ability to make bad art, the easier it is to just make art. When you go in with expectations for what you want things to look like, you're setting up that success and failure state for yourself.</p>

<h2>Using New Materials to Keep Things Fresh</h2>

<p>Getting this sort of paper that's new to me is an attempt at trying to keep the process of learning to draw fun. For anyone curious, I'm using a <strong>chisel tip calligraphy pen</strong> that I've really liked lately. It's essentially a triangle tip chisel pen, and it lets me get strokes that are a little bit fatter while also doing a flatline stroke.</p>

<h2>Embracing Spontaneity in Creation</h2>

<p>There's a famous clip of <strong>Paul McCartney</strong> writing "Get Back" where he's just making guttural sounds, letting the music come out of him from nothing. To me, this is the same version of that, seeing if something works, and if it doesn't, just letting myself experiment.</p>

<p>Again, most of it is bad, but some of it is good. The ability to let yourself play and make mistakes is the number one thing I'm trying to latch onto more myself and the number one thing I recommend to people who study with me.</p>

<h2>The Advantage of Intuitive Drawing</h2>

<p>Thinking this way, especially when drawing from imagination, allows you to use this as the base to draw everything from. Imaginative drawing is a lot more about <strong>reacting to shapes or strokes</strong> that you make versus planning everything out from the very beginning. There is an element of planning, but it's more helpful if you're intuitive and let your body and brain sort of do stuff.</p>

<h2>Drawing from Life and Using Reference</h2>

<p>For this drawing specifically, I'm using the information I've gotten from drawing from life a lot, the rhythms and anatomy I draw in a normal figure drawing class. I'm letting my body and brain react as I'm throwing things down.</p>

<p>For anyone wanting to get more into sketching or imaginative drawing, my advice is <strong>just to start</strong>. Lately, I've been drawing a lot of torsos and anatomy, coming from a place of really liking comic book art. I'm a giant fan of artists like <strong>Ryan Ottley</strong>, <strong>Jorge Jim√©nez</strong>, and <strong>Ryan Benjamin</strong>. I've watched tons of their videos and absorbed the knowledge they've put out there. It's helped a little, but honestly, what's helping me more is doing these little sketches that I'm experimenting with for fun.</p>

<h2>Experimenting Within Familiar Subjects</h2>

<p>Drawing a torso and seeing if there's an interesting way for me to do the traps in a way I haven't before, or positioning the arm more interestingly than in the past. Even just having it be an exercise where I'm letting myself play around, not even caring about whether it's good or bad, just letting myself do a bad drawing.</p>

<p>These sketches are about letting my hand do whatever it wants. You have this thing that you draw over and over again, for me, it's a torso in different poses and angles. It's my thing that I draw when I'm just letting myself do whatever.</p>

<h2>The Importance of a Go-To Subject</h2>

<p>Having that <strong>go-to subject</strong> is an opportunity to draw something more representational while also experimenting with different line weights and strokes in the safety of doing something you already know how to draw well.</p>

<p>When it comes to doing this stuff well from imagination, so much of it is just <strong>mileage</strong>. Creativity and especially creative drawing are intuitive and confidence-based. I don't think you're able to build that confidence without first having a clear understanding or feeling of what it means to draw something well or something you like.</p>

<h2>Starting with Simple Shapes and Fundamentals</h2>

<p>Going back to that <strong>"C, S, and I"</strong> principle or just the fundamentals of drawing, you can start really easily. Building something, doesn't matter what it is, starting with simple shapes. In this case, this is just a cylinder and two shapes relating to each other. The drawing is relatively messy.</p>

<p>I have stacks and stacks of paper in my closet and archives of me doing these little experiments. Over time, you start to develop more of a style or more confidence in drawing the stuff, but your ability to do that depends on your intuition.</p>

<h2>Letting Your Intuition Guide You</h2>

<p>Taking this drawing into something like a portrait, I'm letting my hand go off different little techniques I've observed in teachers and things I've figured out myself. Something like the <strong>Andrew Loomis</strong> method, setting aside the eye, that T thing, or a <strong>Riley method</strong> for the eyes and nose.</p>

<p>But I'm not thinking of this stuff super objectively. It's just kind of what particular solution feels right for the moment. I think the idea of potentially seeing an instance to include the Riley method or some particular thing that I learned objectively when I'm studying and then going back and reading the book and trying to apply it to a drawing organically, that's just not the way drawing feels right or creative to me.</p>

<p>There are instances where I'm definitely making mistakes or injecting things where there's a better way of doing certain things, but that's not the point. I'm trying to build up confidence in a way that feels intuitive and good, versus being a slave to particular parts of a process.</p>

<h2>Adding Depth and Texture Spontaneously</h2>

<p>Within something like this, if we wanted to start telling a story with it somehow or adding some texture or depth, adding something like a background with a marker like this takes almost no objective knowledge. It's almost a feeling thing, what feels right to you?</p>

<p>The reason I think it's so important to do little drawings and sketches like this that are throwaway, not worrying about whether they're good or bad, is because it lets you <strong>play around and experiment</strong>.</p>

<h2>The Danger of Perfectionism</h2>

<p>In the academic world or when you're a student, there's that impulse to feel like everything has to be good for it to feel worth doing. I totally understand that, and I think it's valid. But it's dangerous from the perspective that you're not letting yourself fail as much. <strong>Failure is where most of the learning happens.</strong></p>

<p>I'm not experienced at this sort of drawing at all, but it's been fun to experiment and play around with it. I don't really expect myself to do anything well. If every single instance where you're doing art is from the context of "Will this get me hired?" or "Is this going to further my artistic goals in some way?" it's easy to get burnt out on drawing in general.</p>

<p>All of this stuff is just about whether it feels fun and good. If not, then I just won't do that again. Like this little stroke I made here to be the forehead shadow, it doesn't feel good to me, but it doesn't matter because the sketch is just a little throwaway thing. Even stopping here, I like where this is going. I like how there's this background defining the head and separating the lights and shadows in a way that there's a clear silhouette for the head.</p>

<h2>Finding Success in Small Achievements</h2>

<p>To me, the drawing already feels like a bit of a success because the scope wasn't crazy. Something that's a little bit more messy is an opportunity to focus on the thinking. When I draw this way, trying to think of long strokes and how they relate to each other, there are only so many avenues you can walk down from the more exploratory, reactive method of drawing.</p>

<p>With multiple lines here, I can pick and choose what I'm going for as I'm going back in with ink. I feel like this deltoid is kind of weird. Maybe he's at a desk or something, he just has his hands on a table. Going through with something, this might be a total failure, so bear with me, but I'm going to use this giant marker to see if I can make something that looks cool to me.</p>

<h2>Encouragement to Start Drawing</h2>

<p>It might not feel like you're good enough, or that you don't know enough to start creating artwork you really care about. But at any level you can start experimenting and playing around with different things. To me, the ideal ratio of studying to doing art is something like <strong>30% to 50% studying</strong>, going to figure drawing sessions, studying anatomy and George Bridgman, all that stuff, and then <strong>50% doing art that you really care about</strong>, something that gets you excited about getting up in the morning.</p>

<p>Drawing your own comic book, doing your own illustrations, trying to make a YouTube channel or an Instagram account, those two things combined in that ratio, I think it's just a matter of time before that intuitive drawing is made better by that study. You'll start to subconsciously find ways of introducing your studies into your more intuitive, sketchy stuff.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p>So much of drawing well from imagination is just mileage. Creativity, and especially creative drawing, is so much about intuition and confidence. I don't think you're able to build that confidence without first having a clear understanding or feeling of what it means to draw something well or something you like.</p>

<p>Again, starting with simple shapes and fundamentals, allowing yourself to make mistakes, and letting your intuition guide you are key. Over time, you'll develop more of a style and more confidence. Remember, <strong>failure is where most of the learning happens</strong>. So just start drawing, keep experimenting, and most importantly, <strong>have fun with it</strong>.</p>
