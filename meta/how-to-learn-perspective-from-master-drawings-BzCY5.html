<p>One of the best ways to learn how to draw is to study good drawings. But which ones, and how do you study them? Let's focus on learning perspective through the work of <strong>Winsor McCay</strong>, a drawing master known for his <em>Little Nemo in Slumberland</em> comic strips and <em>Gertie the Dinosaur</em>.</p>

<h2>Studying McCay's Use of Perspective</h2>

<p>In our last lesson, we explored five methods to create the illusion of depth: <strong>diminution</strong>, <strong>atmospheric perspective</strong>, <strong>convergence</strong>, <strong>foreshortening</strong>, and <strong>overlap</strong>. Let's see how McCay used these techniques.</p>

<h3>Diminution and Atmospheric Perspective</h3>

<p>In one panel, McCay drew cannonballs of varying sizes. Despite all being the same hard black with no atmospheric perspective, you read the biggest ones as closest. This is the power of <strong>diminution</strong> - making objects smaller to appear further away.</p>

<p>While the cannonballs lack atmospheric perspective, in previous panels, McCay used a bit of atmosphere between the viewer and a distant ship. This subtle use creates an illusion of security, a storytelling strategy.</p>

<h3>Convergence and Rendering</h3>

<p>McCay didn't heavily rely on <strong>convergence</strong> in these panels, it's mostly hidden. However, he used <strong>rendering</strong> sparingly. The highlights on the cannonballs and patches of tone count as rendering, which adds a touch of realism.</p>

<h3>Foreshortening and Overlap</h3>

<p><strong>Foreshortening</strong> is evident in the way McCay drew bodies, figures appear shorter because they're angled away from you. There's also extensive use of <strong>overlap</strong>, especially with people, but interestingly, no cannonballs overlap each other, a feat in composition.</p>

<h2>Analyzing "Gertie the Dinosaur"</h2>

<p>In <em>Gertie the Dinosaur</em>, overlap is prominent. The ridges on Gertie's neck overlap and get smaller, which enhances depth. While <strong>diminution</strong> isn't strongly used, the legs are the same size despite being steps apart, this is because the viewer isn't close to Gertie.</p>

<h3>Foreshortening and Convergence</h3>

<p>Gertie's head is an example of foreshortening, it looks odd unless you realize she's looking away. <strong>Convergence</strong> isn't prominent here, as there are no significant parallel lines, but hints of one point perspective influence the road and mountain range.</p>

<h2>The Importance of Analysis</h2>

<p>When you study drawing masters like McCay, take your time. Enjoy the artwork, but don't just copy it, <strong>analyze</strong> it. Notice how the artist uses the five methods to create the illusion of depth. Look for ways they might combine these techniques, they can enhance their compositions.</p>

<p>Artists like Winsor McCay masterfully use <strong>rendering</strong>, <strong>overlap</strong>, <strong>diminution</strong>, <strong>foreshortening</strong>, and <strong>convergence</strong> to create depth. By studying and analyzing their work, you can learn how to apply these techniques to your own drawings. This overview sets the stage for more in-depth lessons on perspective to come.</p>
