<h2>What's in Premium?</h2>

<p>Discover how to balance theory and practice in learning perspective drawing. In this lesson, we dive into the concept of "wicked learning"â€”solving drawing problems independently to deepen your understanding. Inspired by Ernest Watson's teaching methods, we explore how hands-on practice complements theoretical knowledge.</p>

<p>You'll learn how to enhance realism in your drawings by understanding how objects appear as they recede towards the horizon. We'll discuss common challenges from the "melted pancakes" project, such as accurately depicting how forms lay on the ground plane. By integrating observation with perspective theory, you'll develop skills to create convincing depth in your artwork.</p>
