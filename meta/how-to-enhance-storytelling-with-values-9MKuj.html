<p>An artist's job isn't about capturing all the details. It's about <strong>interpreting</strong>. We summarize and distill with an opinion. The images we create communicate with our viewers, and <strong>strong compositions</strong> get the message across clearly.</p>

<p>Composition is a huge topic. We can spend a full course just on composition, learning theory, large, medium, small shapes, balance versus tension, static versus dynamic, contrast, harmony, flow, patterns, focal points. Some of the best ways to get good at it are looking at <strong>nature</strong>, studying <strong>masters</strong>, and thinking about composition in your own drawings.</p>

<p>In this lesson, let's learn some of the things you should be thinking about when composing <strong>values</strong> in your drawings.</p>

<h2>Value Range</h2>

<p>It's quite common for drawings and paintings to have a <strong>full range of values</strong> or really close to it. This means that somewhere in the picture, you'll find a <strong>white and black</strong>. A full value range gives you <strong>maximum contrast</strong> to work with.</p>

<p>But you don't have to use every value. You can use a <strong>limited value range</strong>:</p>

<ul>

<li>Use just the <strong>dark half</strong> of the scale.</li>

<li>Use just the <strong>light half</strong>.</li>

<li>Use only the <strong>middle values</strong>.</li>

</ul>

<p>Using middle values is a great strategy if you're painting and you want it to be as <strong>colorful</strong> as possible. The most intense colors are in that middle range. When you add black or white to any color, you lower the <strong>chroma</strong>.</p>

<p>Whether you have a full range or a limited range, you can also limit which values you use <strong>within</strong> that range. You can split a full range into sections:</p>

<ul>

<li>Use just the values at the <strong>two extremes</strong> and nothing in the middle.</li>

<li>Split the range into different segments.</li>

</ul>

<p>The options are limited only by your imagination. You are the artist, and you can use these tools how you want. Your decisions can have a big impact on the <strong>mood</strong> and overall <strong>feel</strong> of your picture, and sometimes it could be a very important part of your <strong>style</strong>.</p>

<p>For those of you just starting out with values, the most important thing is identifying the <strong>extremes</strong>. Where are the <strong>lightest lights</strong> and the <strong>darkest darks</strong>? Where are they on the value scale, and where are they in your picture? Once you know that range and where they are in your picture, they become very useful reference points. You can judge other values based on these extremes.</p>

<h2>Value Keys</h2>

<p>Now let's talk about <strong>value keys</strong>. This has to do with <strong>how you distribute values within your range</strong>. You might be using a full value range, but <strong>how much</strong> of each value are you using?</p>

<p>Both of these paintings are utilizing a full range of values from white to black, but the first one appears much darker. A <strong>histogram</strong> shows the <strong>value distribution</strong>. The peaks show which values are more common, and the dips show which values are rare. The first painting appears darker not because of its range, but because it's <strong>heavy on the dark half</strong> of the range.</p>

<p>This is called <strong>low key</strong>.</p>

<p>When the values are heavily distributed on the lighter side, that's called <strong>high key</strong>.</p>

<p>A drawing or painting can be any one of these extremes or anything in between. When the distribution is fairly balanced or very heavy on the mid-tones, this is called <strong>mid-key</strong>.</p>

<p>Limiting your range to just the darker half of the value scale would force that painting to be <strong>low key</strong>. But it's not just about limiting your range to lighter or darker. You can have a pure white in a low-key painting as long as the painting is <strong>dominated by the darks</strong>. This value range might suggest low key, but the <strong>value distribution</strong> makes it high key.</p>

<p><strong>Value keys</strong> can have an effect on the <strong>mood</strong> of the picture. A dark, low-key composition can feel <strong>dramatic</strong> or <strong>mysterious</strong>. A light, high-key composition can feel <strong>airy</strong>, <strong>open</strong>, or <strong>calm</strong>.</p>

<p>When you're thinking about the value range or key of your pieces, consider the <strong>context and narrative</strong>. Adjust the values to support the <strong>story</strong> and resonate with the <strong>subject matter</strong>.</p>

<h3>Using Rare High Contrast Values</h3>

<p>One nice trick is to use a <strong>rare high contrast value</strong>. In a low-key dark painting, a few very light shapes will <strong>stand out the most</strong>. No matter where you put them, the white shapes <strong>yell for attention</strong>. It's the same in reverse too. Even if you scatter a bunch of small black shapes, your eye still goes to the light shapes. They're unique and have a <strong>high contrast</strong> against the rest of the picture.</p>

<p>As Seth Godin puts it, they're the <strong>purple cows</strong>. If you're driving down the road and all you see are brown cows, and then you see a purple cow, it's going to stand out.</p>

<p>Now, you don't have to have a purple cow in your drawing. This isn't the only way to bring focus to an area. You can have a <strong>balance of values</strong> and still have a clear focal point with shapes leading the eye or more detail in the focal point.</p>

<p>There's no correct answer to how much of each value to use, but it's useful to consider it. You get to ponder on it and decide which distributions match your vision and preference.</p>

<h2>Value Hierarchy</h2>

<p>In the level two critique video from the last project, where we simplified our thumbnails down to two or three values, we saw how the placement of <strong>value thresholds</strong> affects which part of our picture feels more important.</p>

<p>One option is to <strong>prioritize the difference between light and shadow</strong>. Another is to make the <strong>objects pop against the background</strong>.</p>

<p>By managing <strong>value relationships</strong>, you create a <strong>hierarchy of importance</strong> that guides the viewer's eye through the composition. Is the object as a whole more important? Or are the light and shadows showing the forms more important? Well, that's up to you.</p>

<p>You don't have to stick exactly to the values in your reference. You can <strong>change the reference</strong> to suit your needs. You can increase contrast in key areas, reduce it in others, or even invent new value patterns that serve the <strong>story</strong> you're telling.</p>

<p>These value hierarchies show the viewers <strong>what matters most</strong>. Like a well-structured article leads the readers through the key points.</p>

<p>For example, you might emphasize the <strong>face in a portrait</strong> by using higher contrast within and keeping the background simpler. You can tone down the highlights in the hair, and now instead of distracting from the face, the hair is a <strong>frame</strong> around it.</p>

<p>It's typically a good idea to avoid <strong>spotty values</strong> that break unity. When in doubt, make related areas share related values.</p>

<h3>Analyzing NC Wyeth's Painting</h3>

<p>Let's analyze this painting by <strong>NC Wyeth</strong>. The histogram of the painting reveals <strong>four distinct value groups</strong>. By splitting the values at the dips in the histogram, we see:</p>

<ul>

<li>The lightest value is the <strong>mountain</strong>.</li>

<li>The next lightest value is the <strong>sky</strong>.</li>

<li>The darker value is the <strong>foreground rock</strong>.</li>

<li>The darkest value is the <strong>man</strong>.</li>

</ul>

<p>Interestingly, the two lighter groups represent the <strong>background</strong>, while the two darker groups represent the <strong>foreground</strong>. These are deliberate choices by Wyeth.</p>

<p>The four groups separate the main objects in the scene for <strong>clarity</strong>, and the two pairs of groups separate the foreground and background to create <strong>depth</strong>. This is one of the most perfect examples of <strong>value hierarchy</strong> I've ever seen.</p>

<h3>Beyond Lines: Jeff Darrow's Drawing</h3>

<p>Remember when we used <strong>line weight</strong> to create unity and hierarchy? Well, sometimes we need more than just lines.</p>

<p>Take a look at this drawing by <strong>Jeff Darrow</strong>. There's so much detail that at first glance, it's hard to understand what's happening. It's beautiful, you can get lost in the design. But notice what happens when he adds <strong>color</strong> or even just <strong>values</strong>. Suddenly, things become clearer. The <strong>value groupings</strong> define the silhouettes of the bodies, and they separate them from the ground plane.</p>

<h2>Experimenting with Value</h2>

<p>As you move forward with your own work, <strong>experiment</strong> with these concepts. Try creating the same scene with different <strong>value distributions</strong>. See how it changes the <strong>feeling</strong>, the <strong>focus</strong>, the <strong>story</strong> you're telling.</p>

<p>Don't be afraid to push the <strong>extremes</strong> or try subtle variations that speak to your <strong>artistic voice</strong>. And keep doing those <strong>master studies</strong>. Now that you know these tools, studying the masters can help you understand how to use them.</p>

<h2>Value Study Tool</h2>

<p>By the way, I made a little <strong>value study tool</strong> over at <a href="https://proko.com/values">proko.com/values</a>. It's like the gradient map layer in Photoshop that I showed you, but with some additional features. Several of you mentioned that you don't have Photoshop, so this should be very useful.</p>

<p>You just load in a painting and add some value steps in the gradient bar. The <strong>histogram</strong> shows you how much of each value is in your image, which can help you identify the major value groups. You can also adjust the number of steps with the slider and then click <strong>distribute</strong> if you want them to be evenly distributed.</p>

<p>The <strong>simplicity slider</strong> simplifies the shapes and removes details. Down below, you can see the <strong>value distribution</strong> and a little indicator telling you if your image is <strong>high key</strong>, <strong>mid key</strong>, or <strong>low key</strong>. There are two view options that you can toggle between. If you're in the single image view, you can click and hold the image to switch between the original and the value study.</p>

<p>Go check it out. I hope you find it useful.</p>

<p>In the next project, we will <strong>experiment</strong>. We'll explore various solutions. Over time, you'll build a stronger intuition for which value choices support your ideas.</p>
