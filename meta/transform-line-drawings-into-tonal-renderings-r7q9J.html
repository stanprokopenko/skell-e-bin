<p>You've worked through a simple construction of the head, developing the features and planes. Now you're ready to add light and shadow to bring depth and realism to your drawing. In this lesson, we'll explore how to transition from line drawings to tonal drawings by understanding the forms and edges that make up the face.</p>

<h2>Simplifying Forms: Sphere, Cylinder, and Box</h2>

<p>When transitioning from line to tone, think about every area of line as being one of three types of forms:</p>

<ul>

<li>A <strong>sphere</strong></li>

<li>A <strong>cylinder</strong></li>

<li>A <strong>box</strong></li>

</ul>

<p>Light hits these specific forms in predictable ways. By associating parts of the face with these basic forms, you can better understand how light and shadow should appear.</p>

<h2>Associating Edges with Forms</h2>

<p>In nature, you don't see harsh lines, instead, you see edges where light transitions to shadow. To move from your linear drawing to a tonal drawing, associate each form with a type of edge,</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Soft edges</strong> for spheres</li>

<li><strong>Firm edges</strong> for cylinders</li>

<li><strong>Hard edges</strong> for boxes</li>

</ul>

<p>This approach helps you decide how to render the transitions between light and shadow on different parts of the face.</p>

<h2>Types of Edges</h2>

<p>There are four types of edges you can use in your drawing:</p>

<ol>

<li><strong>Soft edges</strong>: Gradual transitions, used for spherical forms.</li>

<li><strong>Firm edges</strong>: Slightly sharper transitions, used for cylindrical forms.</li>

<li><strong>Hard edges</strong>: Abrupt transitions, used for box-like forms.</li>

<li><strong>Lost edges</strong>: Areas where light weakens and there's no clear distinction between light and shadow. Use these to create atmospheric effects or to guide the viewer's focus.</li>

</ol>

<h2>Applying Edges to Your Drawing</h2>

<p>Now let's apply this understanding of forms and edges to your drawing.</p>

<h3>The Forehead</h3>

<p>Consider the forehead as a <strong>spherical form</strong>. Find the division between light and shadow, and use a <strong>soft edge</strong> to indicate the gradual transition. Replace any harsh lines with soft gradations to move the eye slowly across the surface.</p>

<h3>The Eye Sockets</h3>

<p>The eye sockets are more <strong>box-like</strong>. Use <strong>hard edges</strong> to define the plane changes sharply. If muscles or skin soften the edges, you might use a slightly less hard edge.</p>

<p>For the eyes themselves, think of them as <strong>spheres</strong>. Shade them with <strong>soft edges</strong> to indicate the form shadow without focusing on smaller details yet.</p>

<h3>The Nose</h3>

<p>The nose can be thought of in parts:</p>

<ul>

<li>The bridge of the nose may be <strong>cylindrical</strong>, so use <strong>firm edges</strong>.</li>

<li>The tip of the nose is <strong>spherical</strong>, so use <strong>soft edges</strong>.</li>

<li>The sides of the nose can create <strong>cast shadows</strong>, which have <strong>hard edges</strong>.</li>

</ul>

<p>Map out where the light hits and where shadows fall, replacing lines with appropriate edges.</p>

<h3>The Cheeks</h3>

<p>Treat the cheeks as either <strong>cylindrical</strong> or <strong>spherical</strong> forms, depending on their shape. Use <strong>firm edges</strong> for cylindrical areas and <strong>soft edges</strong> for more spherical areas. Observe how light gradually transitions across these forms.</p>

<h3>The Mouth and Chin</h3>

<p>Consider the mouth area as a <strong>sphere</strong>. Use <strong>soft edges</strong> to show the form shadow on the upper lip and the gradual transition into shadow on the lower lip.</p>

<p>The chin can be thought of as an <strong>egg-shaped form</strong>. Use <strong>soft edges</strong> to indicate the core shadow and transition into the shadow side.</p>

<h3>The Jawline and Neck</h3>

<p>The jawline may appear more <strong>cylindrical</strong>, so use <strong>firm edges</strong>. The neck can have both form shadows and cast shadows. Observe where the shadows fall and apply the appropriate edges, using <strong>soft</strong> or <strong>firm edges</strong> as needed.</p>

<h2>Mapping Light and Shadow</h2>

<p>Begin by identifying the most prominent changes between light and shadow on the face. Separate the light side from the shadow side. Use your understanding of forms and edges to map out where the <strong>core shadows</strong> are and how the light transitions across the surfaces.</p>

<p>Remember, you're not trying to copy exactly what's in front of you. Instead, think about <strong>timing</strong>, how the viewer's eye moves across the drawing. Use edges to control the speed at which the eye travels over different forms.</p>

<h2>Understanding Lighting Conditions</h2>

<p>Consider the type and direction of light:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Type of light</strong>: Is it sunlight, candlelight, or something else?</li>

<li><strong>Direction of light</strong>: Where is it coming from?</li>

</ul>

<p>Understanding the lighting conditions helps inform how you apply light and shadow to the forms.</p>

<p>Focus on the <strong>core shadow</strong>, which describes the form and its turn away from the light. Contrast this with <strong>cast shadows</strong>, which occur when one form blocks light from reaching another. Observe how these shadows interact with the forms of the face.</p>

<h2>Value Composition</h2>

<p>Think about the overall value composition of your drawing:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Value 1</strong>: The white of the paper.</li>

<li><strong>Value 5</strong>: Mid-tones.</li>

<li><strong>Value 10</strong>: The darkest shadows.</li>

</ul>

<p>Start by filling in the shadow areas with a mid-tone value of around <strong>5</strong>. This helps establish the key relationships between light and shadow. Keep your lightest lights and darkest darks reserved for the areas where you want the most contrast and focus.</p>

<h2>Finalizing the Drawing</h2>

<p>As you begin to add tone to your drawing, you'll start to lose some of the initial lines and planes you drew. This is a good thing. Those lines served as scaffolding to help you make decisions around tone and form.</p>

<p>Replace lines with edges, and continue to refine the transitions between light and shadow. Use <strong>lost edges</strong> where appropriate to create atmosphere or to guide the viewer's focus toward your intended focal point.</p>

<p>Remember, there are <strong>no lines in nature, only edges</strong>. By focusing on edges, you'll create a drawing that feels more natural and realistic.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p>By simplifying the complex forms of the face into <strong>spheres</strong>, <strong>cylinders</strong>, and <strong>boxes</strong>, and by associating appropriate edges with these forms, you can effectively transition from a line drawing to a tonal drawing. This approach helps you create a more realistic and natural depiction of the face, guiding the viewer's eye through thoughtful control of edges and values.</p>

<p>As you practice, you'll find that your drawings gain depth and subtlety. Keep observing how light interacts with different forms, and use edges to convey that interaction. With time, replacing lines with edges will become second nature, and your portraits will have a greater sense of life and realism.</p>
