<h2>Choosing the Thumbnail</h2>

<p>I've decided to go with this thumbnail, the one with the biker gang and the bunny boy, just because it offers the most opportunity to draw edgier, cooler things that will appeal to a very different audience than those who like to see the cute little boy. This one has both, but realistically, I'm thinking about what sort of story or elements I would adjust to make it into a print I would want on a wall.</p>

<h2>Balancing Art Brain and Business Brain</h2>

<p>The real reason I'm going to change things has a lot to do with something I like to call my <strong>art brain fighting my business brain</strong>. My <strong>art brain</strong> is the side of me that just wants to make stuff for myself, explore concepts, and do things purely for fun, an important part of being an artist. It's maybe equally important to the other half of my brain, which is the <strong>business brain</strong>. Business brain asks questions like,</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Who's the audience for this?</strong></li>

<li><strong>Would I want it on a wall?</strong></li>

<li><strong>Would this appeal to a studio I'm trying to work for?</strong></li>

</ul>

<p>All the considerations that make what I'm doing fit into the rest of the world so I can survive and exist as an artist who makes work people want to consume.</p>

<p>I like this thumbnail the most, but I don't know if I'd put it on my own wall as it is right now. So I'm going to make changes to appeal more to the business side of my brain while maintaining the artistic goals of my art brain.</p>

<p>I'm sure you guys, if you've been drawing for a while, know the difference. Sometimes, business brain tells you to make things to impress people on Instagram, whereas art brain should be thinking about how to improve, how to get better, and how to, shonen anime-style, become the best artist ever. Those are two different things. Learning to distinguish them as different sides of yourself and knowing how much to listen to either one is important. Don't let either one fully take over, or you'd be unhappy either way.</p>

<h2>Adjusting the Main Character</h2>

<p>To start, the process that more of you might know me for is just going for it and drawing straight up. I could do that, but because this is a class, I want to reveal more of my understanding. When I draw that way, I draw really slowly and think through everything I'm drawing, so much so that I'm pre-visualizing what I'm going to draw onto the page. This is particularly important when I'm doing traditional, which is also how I prefer to draw. But since we're doing digital, that isn't an issue. And because they're recording me here today, it would take them forever, and I don't want to do that to them. So I'll take some shortcuts but also hopefully reveal more of what I'm thinking.</p>

<h3>Replacing the Biker with a Female Character</h3>

<p>The first thing I want to hone in on is the placement of my main character. Because we're working loosely and can undo or have multiple layers, I'm just going to block it in without thinking of any of these lines as final. It's really just to block out the space, something you could do with color blocking and even roughing color at the same time.</p>

<p>I think he needed to move over to make this a two-point perspective. The biggest change I was thinking of making to the piece overall is how appealing this main character is to look at. As funny as I think it is to have this really rough eyepatch gangster biker, I feel like if you had that on your own wall at home, I'm not exactly sure what that would be saying. I feel like I can have the same kind of attitude, but frankly, I feel like a female character would be a little bit more fun to look at.</p>

<p>That's what art is about, <strong>looking at it</strong>. I still think she can be cool and have tattoos, though. I'm wondering if I want her to have a bowl of noodles.</p>

<h3>Experimenting with Poses</h3>

<p>This initial sketch is kind of a continuation of the ideation phase that's normally more in the thumbnail portion. But because we're digital and I want to show you guys more of how my brain works, rather than being tied down to every line I make and then just having to make it work from there, we can play around a little more here.</p>

<p>I'm thinking this arm could be the one holding the bowl. I feel like a dangling arm has so much attitude of "I don't care, whatever." Maybe this is the one holding chopsticks. Maybe she's pointing with the chopsticks like that, that's pretty cool.</p>

<p>I don't do this nearly enough, but literally using your own body as a reference is helpful. I'm looking at this because I'm studying what the angles are. This finger being in line with the stick or pencil, and then this finger being the support. These last two kind of just follow that middle finger.</p>

<p>So no more dangling arm there, just because we need to prioritize story a little bit. I do think her arm out here could have a clearer silhouette. So maybe I'll have to adjust the leg just to give some breathing room around this arm. Similarly, I may bring in the bowl here so that this arm is a little more free.</p>

<p>Now I'm caught between thinking about where this arm will go if it's leaning on the knee here. Then that would put the natural placement for the bowl to be over here.</p>

<h2>Considering Composition and Aspect Ratio</h2>

<p>The aspect ratio I'm going with is 18 by 24, and that's a lot less wide than this one. So adjusting these main elements to fit within that space.</p>

<p>Drawing our motorcycle helmet to be the head of our motorcycle. Chest piece, wheel. Here's the shape, this building that's defining our perspective here. This has got to be more flat here.</p>

<p>One consideration is because it's not as wide, I don't have as much space here to accomplish the legs that I wanted previously. And if this person is eating, then maybe the story is just people eating on the sidewalk. So how do we get somebody to be over here showing more food? This is a person's head. I still want more space, more separation.</p>

<h2>Adding Elements to Enhance the Story</h2>

<h3>Incorporating a Cat Companion</h3>

<p>I'm missing this cat element. Somehow they added a little lightness to it that I feel like this doesn't have the playfulness that I want it to have. So maybe that's something I need to think about adding right now.</p>

<h3>Using Background Characters to Create Depth</h3>

<p>This person is kind of like they're being useful as far as shifting the scene towards our viewer because we get the head turn that points us towards them. But I think the pose doesn't add enough to the story.</p>

<p>Sometimes it's really helpful to add people into a scene, just to create a sense of space. What I mean by that is humans are something that's a known quantity, we all know how big a human should be. So making them really small, we don't assume that it's a miniature person, we think it's a person who's far away. So sometimes putting a person into the scene can help fill in that space and understanding. But with that said, I don't know if I want them here.</p>

<p>But I do think showing more than one bike would be good. And if he's further back, then he can be used to show that they're eating.</p>

<h2>Refocusing on the Original Idea</h2>

<h3>Avoiding Too Many Concepts</h3>

<p>Okay, potential switch-ups. I've been thinking about this. I took a minute to think through what I'm doing. I feel like they might be juggling too many concepts to have them eating and be tough, because I feel like the toughness of the characters is what makes the contrast between these two parties make sense versus if everybody's friendly, then it's just a friendly vibe.</p>

<p>So what I think that means is the piece will have to rely on <strong>rule of cool</strong> for our bikers rather than having them also be eating. So I'm going to adjust and pretty much stick to more of the original composition and thumbnail, but just try to make it more of a cool piece. And by cool, I mean it's about how appealing the characters look as opposed to being about the atmosphere. That's what we're going to try.</p>

<p>Basically, I feel like I fell victim to the thing I mentioned previously where if you have a central idea about a piece but you're not clear on what it is, then you start to wrestle with it and try to make it about more than one thing. And when it's about more than one thing, it's about neither. So I'm just going to try to <strong>stick to my guns</strong> a little bit. It may not be the sort of piece that has all the boxes ticked for business brain, but sometimes that's not what the idea is. And in this case, because I am going for it, I'm going to try to stay true to the original vision a bit more.</p>

<h3>Returning to the Original Composition</h3>

<p>With that said, I think a clean thumbnail might be the simplest thing to do. Okay, so I'm going to roughly go in with it. Yeah, when your art demo becomes about what not to do.</p>

<p>But also the advantage of when I do things traditionally is I don't get that choice. It's just like, "Oh, I better finish," and rather than compromising the drawing by making it about two things at once, I know that that'd be a lot harder of a task a lot of times. So then I don't, because it would be too much work.</p>

<h2>Finalizing the Sketch</h2>

<h3>Nailing the Tone</h3>

<p>Sometimes the most important part at this stage is <strong>nailing the tone</strong> that you know you want to achieve. So in this case, that means I'm trying to get the emotion from this main character that I like from the biker character.</p>

<p>I feel like this silhouette here of this main character is pretty good, pretty set, but I have not decided exactly what pose to do with this one just because the angle is different for this character.</p>

<h3>Relearning My Own Advice</h3>

<p>It's funny because as much as I'm teaching this class right now, I definitely have to relearn all the things that I teach myself all the time. It's humbling and it's annoying, but that's also the reality of it.</p>

<p>So, what I was doing that wasn't working for me was that I had to basically redesign that character to appeal to the business brain side of me. But that's the thing where you're designing on the spot, you're not using your research. So I had to kind of follow my own advice more often sometimes. And then sometimes the tricky thing is sometimes it works out, and so you think you can get away with it.</p>

<h2>Adding Cohesion with the Cat Companion</h2>

<p>Positioning my characters to be a little bit more central here. Oh, I did have one idea that I think I can add to this piece that is speaking to the same spirit of what we were doing in the research while not really going too far off, which is that this cat that I added kind of randomly, we could decide that it's a companion of our bunny boy character.</p>

<p>So for now, the way that I was imagining it would work is that it's a cat, but it's wearing the same hat, which is ridiculous. But the reason why I have to reuse it is a practical one: if it doesn't have a really clear indicator that it's related to our main character, then you just wouldn't know. It would just seem like a random cat. So by using the research pieces that you figure out intentionally and over and over again like that, it also naturally creates a level of cohesion between these things.</p>

<h2>Evolving the Story</h2>

<p>What I'm also figuring out here is potentially that it all makes a lot more sense if they're on a sidewalk here. As you're drawing, I think it's totally normal and very common, at least for myself, that some of the story evolves, some of the ideas change or progress as you draw them again from your thumbnail.</p>

<p>Part of me is wondering if my internal story is that this biker gang is offering Bunny Boy a ride. And so what makes more sense then is that this character is telling them to hop on, so to speak. Probably need to be further back with this.</p>

<p>Okay, I like this idea, but I think I need to move it away to potentially just somewhere else. Saving that layer just in case I do want to reuse it. But I think what's more key in this real estate behind is the connection between this character and the bike.</p>

<p>Oh, and let's dub in some of the stuff we're more comfortable with, the central back. Okay. And maybe we can be playful with the bike, where the design can be a little bit less generic and more something that we design as a mashup of the things that we researched.</p>

<h2>Creating a Working Document</h2>

<p>So here's my remapping of the thumbnail to the 18 by 24 aspect ratio that I want to achieve. And so this is kind of like a working document. I feel like if I ever want to change any of the details, I totally can, for example, fix the posing on this character over here if I need to or if I see a better idea. But it's kind of stubbed in, so I can at least at this point draw over this and finalize and get towards the actual line art for my piece.</p>
