<h2>The Nine Basic Positions</h2>

<p>When drawing objects, they can be viewed from <strong>nine basic positions</strong>:</p>

<ul>

<li>Directly in front (<strong>ortho view</strong>)</li>

<li>To the <strong>left</strong> or <strong>right</strong></li>

<li><strong>Above</strong> or <strong>below</strong></li>

<li>Above to the <strong>left</strong> or <strong>right</strong></li>

<li>Below to the <strong>left</strong> or <strong>right</strong></li>

</ul>

<p>Understanding these positions simplifies perspective. Most objects you draw will likely be in one of these categories.</p>

<h2>Understanding Axes and Depth</h2>

<p>By adding the <strong>depth axis (Z lines)</strong> to the X and Y axes, you transform flat shapes into three-dimensional forms. The Z lines give your objects <strong>thickness</strong>, making them appear more realistic.</p>

<h2>Observing Angle Changes</h2>

<p>When viewing objects from different angles:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Right angles change</strong> based on perspective.</li>

<li>With two planes visible, front corners become <strong>acute</strong>, back corners become <strong>obtuse</strong>.</li>

<li>With three planes visible, side angles become <strong>acute</strong>, front and back become <strong>obtuse</strong>.</li>

</ul>

<p>Consider measuring these angles to train your eye, but focus on how perspective affects them.</p>

<h2>Simplifying Complexity</h2>

<p>Many positions are <strong>flipped repeats</strong> (left to right or up to down). Recognizing this reduces the complexity, making drawing objects more manageable.</p>

<h2>Drawing Arrows in Perspective</h2>

<p>Storyboard artists use <strong>arrows</strong> to indicate movement:</p>

<ul>

<li>A <strong>flat arrow</strong> shows movement <strong>across</strong> the screen.</li>

<li>An arrow in <strong>perspective</strong> shows movement <strong>toward</strong> or <strong>away from</strong> the camera.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Creating 3D Arrows</h3>

<p>To draw arrows in any direction:</p>

<ol>

<li>Start with a <strong>flat arrow</strong>.</li>

<li><strong>Foreshorten</strong> it to add depth.</li>

<li>Remember, arrows are not symmetrical front to back, the <strong>point</strong> and <strong>tail</strong> differ.</li>

<li>Draw arrows <strong>coming toward</strong> or <strong>going away</strong> from you at various angles.</li>

</ol>

<h2>Practicing with Blocks and Arrows</h2>

<p>To build your foundation:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Draw these arrows</strong> and <strong>name their positions</strong> (e.g., above left, below right).</li>

<li>Notice the direction of the <strong>X, Y, and Z lines</strong> in each position.</li>

<li>Practice drawing them <strong>from memory</strong>.</li>

</ul>

<p>By familiarizing yourself with these basics, you'll enhance your ability to sketch from imagination. Soon, you'll be ready to place the <strong>eye level</strong> with a <strong>horizon line</strong> and tackle more complex perspectives.</p>
