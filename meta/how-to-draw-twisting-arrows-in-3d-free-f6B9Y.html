<h2>What's in Premium?</h2>

<p>In this premium lesson, we dive into mastering arrows in every direction. You'll learn how to simplify complex curved forms into basic shapes to better understand their structure. We'll discuss transforming twisting arrows into blocks to clarify direction and prevent misinterpretation, using the principle of diminution to convey depth effectively.</p>

<p>We emphasize the importance of practicing the basics and redoing exercises to build a strong foundation. If you're facing challenges with perspective, we'll guide you on thinking in terms of X, Y, and Z axes to improve your drawings.</p>

<p>You'll also learn how to apply these skills to more complex objects, like airplanes, and understand how perspective changes with orientation. Finally, we'll preview upcoming lessons on establishing perspective using eye level and horizon, and finding hidden points within structures.</p>
