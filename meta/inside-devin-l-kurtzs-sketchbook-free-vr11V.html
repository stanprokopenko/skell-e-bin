<h2>What's in Premium?</h2>

<p>In the premium lesson <strong>"My Sketchbook Practice: Building a Visual Library"</strong>, I share how I use my sketchbook as a <strong>practice zone</strong> to <strong>study from reference</strong> and <strong>memorize material</strong>. You'll learn how to fill your sketchbook with sketches of <strong>plants</strong>, <strong>everyday objects</strong>, and more, drawing from life and resources like <strong>Pinterest</strong>.</p>

<p>I explain how to <strong>build a visual library</strong> by drawing <strong>many versions of the same thing</strong>, which helps you avoid generic drawings. We discuss how to <strong>tell stories through objects</strong>, enhancing your art by adding personality and history to items like <strong>chairs</strong> and <strong>lamps</strong>.</p>

<p>You'll see how I <strong>learn from other artists</strong> by studying their work, and how working in <strong>pen</strong> helps me embrace mistakes and improve. I cover <strong>practicing compositions</strong>, arranging objects with attention to shape and balance. Finally, I show how these studies allow me to draw from <strong>imagination</strong>, storing knowledge internally to bring more depth to my art.</p>
