<p>Let's use this model cathedral to learn a few lessons about <strong>eye level</strong> and <strong>proximity</strong> in perspective drawing. You've already studied eye level, it determines whether we view a subject from above or below with respect to the horizon. Soon, we'll dive into proximity, which places our view close or far and makes a huge difference in how things look.</p>

<h2>Observing the Cathedral from Afar</h2>

<p>We'll start by setting up the camera far away from the cathedral and zooming in to observe it from varying levels.</p>

<h3>Starting Low: Looking Up from a Distance</h3>

<p>From a low eye level, we are supposedly looking up at the cathedral. However, because we're so far away, everything appears as if it's at eye level. Here's a hint, we see straight through these windows. But look at the higher windows, we're looking slightly up into the darkness of the dome.</p>

<p>When we lift our eye level toward those higher windows, we see straight through them. Now, look down to the lower parts, we see ever so slightly down into the floor where we used to see straight through. When we raise our view even higher, we see more of the floor, not a lot, but enough to notice the difference. We even look slightly down into the lower windows.</p>

<p>At this distance, small changes in eye level result in minimal changes in what we see because the entire cathedral is far away.</p>

<h2>Moving Closer to the Cathedral</h2>

<p>Now, let's get closer to the cathedral to make these effects more impressive.</p>

<h3>Middle Height: Observing from Up Close</h3>

<p>As we move closer, there's no question we're changing our perspective dramatically. Imagine we're floating down to a position at <strong>middle height</strong>. From here, we're close, and we can look up into the higher parts of the cathedral and down into the lower areas. The difference is much more pronounced than when we were far away.</p>

<h3>Ground Level: Looking Up at Towering Heights</h3>

<p>What if we get down near <strong>ground level</strong>? Everything towers above us. That's what we see when we're close, the cathedral looms overhead, and we have to look up significantly to see the top.</p>

<h3>Comparing Close and Far Views</h3>

<p>Remember, at this middle height, up close, the cathedral looked imposing and the angles were steep. Far back, at the same eye level, it looked much flatter. Let me explain why.</p>

<h2>Understanding the Effects of Proximity on Perspective</h2>

<p>When you're far back, the entire subject is distant. So, looking a little bit up or down barely changes the angles you perceive. The lines remain relatively parallel, and the distortion is minimal. It almost looks like an <strong>orthographic projection</strong>.</p>

<p>When you're up close, you must spread out your angle of vision to look up or down. The closer you get to an object, the more you <strong>distort</strong> it due to perspective. This distortion makes vertical lines converge, and angles appear more dramatic.</p>

<h2>Viewing from Above</h2>

<p>Now, let's consider what happens when we look down from a high eye level, way above the cathedral.</p>

<h3>High Eye Level: Looking Down</h3>

<p>When we position our eye level high above the cathedral and aim down toward the dome, the whole structure is below us. The proportions of what's below us are relatively consistent. However, when we're up close and look down, the distortion increases, and the angles spread out due to proximity.</p>

<h2>The Impact of Proximity on Distortion</h2>

<p>Proximity brings significant distortion to our perspective. The closer we are to the cathedral, the more pronounced the angles and the greater the distortion. This is a whole other subject we'll get to soon.</p>

<p>If you're ambitious and bright, you can study these varying views and figure out quite a bit on your own. Observing from above or below, looking up or down, and considering eye level at the horizon, all these factors showcase the effects of eye level and proximity on perspective.</p>

<h2>Looking Ahead</h2>

<p>The concept of how proximity stretches and distorts objects takes some time to explain thoroughly. We're going to cover proximity in detail soon, and I hope to make it fun. But first, we must study the <strong>picture plane</strong>, a few lessons from now.</p>
