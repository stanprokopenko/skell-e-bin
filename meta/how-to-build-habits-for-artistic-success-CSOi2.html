<p>As artists, developing successful habits is essential to our growth and creativity. We've identified <strong>23 habits</strong> that can help us on our journey to becoming better artists. These habits aren't just for artists; they're valuable for anyone looking to achieve success in their field.</p>

<h2>Draw from Life</h2>

<p>Drawing from life allows us to capture the essence of the world around us. Photographs don't capture everything, especially in painting where color information is lost. By drawing from life, we make the critical translation from a <strong>3D object to a 2D picture</strong>, enhancing our observational skills.</p>

<h2>Draw in Your Head</h2>

<p>We can improve our skills by visualizing and <strong>painting pictures in our minds</strong>. When we see something inspiring, like beautiful clouds in the sky, we can imagine how we'd represent them on canvas. This mental exercise helps us make decisions about composition, edges, and color gradations without needing a sketchbook.</p>

<h2>Become Your Own Critic</h2>

<p>Increasing our <strong>feedback loop</strong> is crucial for improvement. We can't always rely on a teacher, so we need to be creative in getting feedback. For example, if we're working on proportions, we can overlay our drawings onto photographs to check for accuracy. This self-critique helps us identify and correct our mistakes quickly.</p>

<h2>Get Information from Multiple Sources</h2>

<p>Learning from <strong>multiple sources</strong> accelerates our growth. It allows us to see where different teachings overlap, focusing our attention on core principles. This approach prevents us from becoming copycats of a single artist and broadens our understanding of art.</p>

<h2>Train Like an Athlete</h2>

<p>Like athletes, we should engage in <strong>deliberate practice</strong>. This means focusing on specific skillsâ€”breaking down our training into bite-sized sessions, such as working on free throws in basketball. By isolating and honing individual skills, we build a stronger foundation for our overall art.</p>

<h2>Break Big Things into Smaller Things</h2>

<p>Tackling a significant goal, like mastering anatomy, can be overwhelming. By <strong>breaking big tasks into smaller ones</strong>, such as focusing solely on hands or arms, we make the learning process more manageable and less daunting.</p>

<h2>Protect Your Most Creative Time</h2>

<p>Identifying and <strong>protecting our most creative time</strong> is vital. Whether we're night owls or early birds, we should reserve this time for our most important work. Avoid filling it with less critical tasks like checking emails.</p>

<h2>Go Beyond the Minimum Requirements</h2>

<p>We should strive to <strong>exceed expectations</strong>. Instead of doing the bare minimum on assignments or projects, pushing ourselves to do more can lead to greater learning and satisfaction. It's about embracing challenges and seeing how far we can go.</p>

<h2>Think Like a Kid</h2>

<p>Kids are naturally creative and unafraid to think outside the box. By <strong>embracing a childlike mindset</strong>, we can generate unique ideas and solutions. This means not being afraid to suggest something unconventional or seemingly "stupid." It opens the door to innovation and creativity.</p>

<h2>Research, Research, Research</h2>

<p>Thorough <strong>research</strong> enhances authenticity and depth in our work. Whether we're designing characters or illustrating stories, understanding the context and details enriches our creations. It's about immersing ourselves in knowledge to produce more meaningful art.</p>

<h2>Patience</h2>

<p>Developing patience is crucial. Improvement doesn't happen overnight. By being patient and <strong>enjoying the process</strong>, we reduce frustration and remain motivated. Recognizing that progress takes time helps us stay committed to our goals.</p>

<h2>Draw Things You Enjoy</h2>

<p>Amidst rigorous practice, it's important to <strong>draw things we love</strong>. This keeps our passion alive and reminds us why we became artists in the first place. Enjoyment fuels creativity and makes the hard work worthwhile.</p>

<h2>Remix Your Inspiration</h2>

<p>By <strong>remixing our inspiration</strong>, we combine elements from various sources to create something new. This prevents us from simply copying and encourages originality. It's about blending influences to develop our unique style.</p>

<h2>Share What We Learn</h2>

<p>Teaching others is a powerful way to <strong>solidify our understanding</strong>. By sharing our knowledge, we organize information more effectively and fill in gaps we didn't know we had. Teaching reinforces our learning and contributes to the community.</p>

<h2>Spend Time with Other Artists</h2>

<p>Being part of a community keeps us motivated and inspired. <strong>Spending time with other artists</strong> provides support, feedback, and shared experiences. It makes solitary practices more enjoyable and fosters growth through collaboration.</p>

<h2>Say No</h2>

<p>Learning to <strong>say no</strong> is essential to protect our time and focus. We can't take on every opportunity or request, especially if it doesn't align with our goals. By saying no, we prioritize what's truly important.</p>

<h2>Say Yes</h2>

<p>Conversely, we should <strong>say yes to challenges</strong> that scare us or opportunities that help us grow. Embracing the unfamiliar pushes us out of our comfort zones and leads to personal and professional development.</p>

<h2>Make Ugly Drawings</h2>

<p>We shouldn't fear failure or producing bad art. By allowing ourselves to <strong>make ugly drawings</strong>, we remove the pressure of perfection. This freedom encourages experimentation and leads to unexpected discoveries.</p>

<h2>Exercise</h2>

<p><strong>Physical exercise</strong> keeps our bodies healthy, which in turn keeps our minds sharp. It prevents injuries and prolongs our ability to create art. Exercise enhances our overall well-being and artistic performance.</p>

<h2>Draw Daily</h2>

<p>Consistency is key. By <strong>drawing daily</strong>, we build strong habits and continually improve our skills. Regular practice ensures steady progress over time.</p>

<h2>Finish What We Start</h2>

<p>It's important to <strong>finish projects</strong>, even when they become challenging. Many people start strong but lose momentum halfway through. By pushing through difficulties, we develop perseverance and achieve greater results.</p>

<h2>Discipline</h2>

<p>Developing <strong>discipline</strong> helps us stay focused on our goals. It's about committing to our craft and consistently putting in the effort, even when it's tough. Discipline is the backbone of success.</p>

<h2>Master Your Calendar</h2>

<p>Effective time management is crucial. By <strong>mastering our calendar</strong>, we plan our weeks deliberately, prioritize tasks, and ensure we're dedicating time to what's important. It's about working smarter, not necessarily harder.</p>

<p>Cultivating these habits can lead us to greater success as artists. By implementing them into our daily lives, we enhance our creativity, productivity, and satisfaction. Let's commit to developing these habits and supporting each other on this artistic journey.</p>
