<h2>What's in Premium?</h2>

<p>In the premium lesson, we analyze Hiroshi Yoshida's <strong>"Rapids"</strong> to understand his masterful use of perspective in depicting water. You'll learn:</p>

<ul>

<li>How water shapes change when viewed from different angles, compressing into <strong>ellipses</strong> when seen along the flow.</li>

<li>The structure of waterfalls, including the <strong>top plane</strong> and the <strong>sloping front plane</strong> with subtle curves.</li>

<li>The rhythm in composition, balancing light and dark areas without sacrificing perspective.</li>

<li>The use of <strong>cross contours</strong> and the <strong>cylinder effect</strong> to convey depth and movement in water.</li>

<li>How the size and structure of <strong>froth and wavelets</strong> diminish as they recede into the distance.</li>

</ul>

<p>This lesson helps you recognize these techniques so you can apply them to your own work.</p>
