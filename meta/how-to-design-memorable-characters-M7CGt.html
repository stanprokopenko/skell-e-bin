<p>Here I want to share with you the tools of concept artists that will help you to create your dream design. One that truly evokes emotions. I'm Evgeniy Estraty and I'm a professional concept artist in the gaming industry and I've worked with BNZ Riot, Valve, and Marvel.</p>

<p>Any design begins with an idea. A good design is one that effectively fulfills its function and solves the problem, whether it is set by the project team or the personal goal of the artist. If you are creating a design for a project, you probably already have a task with a description. But what to do if you want to make a design for yourself and you have no ideas?</p>

<h2>Generating Ideas</h2>

<p>If you lack ideas, you can:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Get inspired by another artist's work</strong> and draw something similar.</li>

<li><strong>Get inspired by a game or a movie</strong> and make your own character for that project.</li>

<li><strong>Create your own project</strong>.</li>

</ul>

<p>For example, I created a project called Gold Rush, a fictional Wild West world during the Gold Rush era, where gold spreads like a mold, causing various mutations. My inspirations were games like Bloodborne and Evil Within.</p>

<h3>Additional Methods for Idea Generation</h3>

<ul>

<li><strong>Visual Mix</strong>: Combine different objects, creatures, or elements to create new designs. For example, combine a motorcycle suit, a German helmet, and a skull to get Darth Vader.</li>

<li><strong>What If?</strong>: Explore unconventional scenarios by asking "what if?" For example, "What if the Wild West was in space?" (e.g., Cowboy Bebop and Firefly).</li>

<li><strong>Reverse Approach</strong>: Ask what would change if something were removed. For example, "What would happen if humanity's reproductive capacity was taken away?"</li>

<li><strong>Scale Experiments</strong>: Change the scale of everyday objects or creatures. For example, "What if humanity had to survive among giant people?"</li>

<li><strong>Influence of Environment</strong>: Consider how the environment can affect a character or city.</li>

<li><strong>Genre Fusion</strong>: Combine two genres, styles, or settings. For example, steampunk and fantasy.</li>

<li><strong>Anachronisms</strong>: Add elements to a historical period that do not belong there or imagine alternative technological developments.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Gathering References</h2>

<p>Gathering references is crucial, especially if the theme and setting are new to you. References can be categorized into:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Mood Board</strong>: Materials that serve as inspiration, convey a certain mood, or set a style. These can include historical photos, existing designs by other artists, or images from games and movies.</li>

<li><strong>Supportive</strong>: References that help you understand and drive the construction of specific objects, clothing elements, or mechanisms.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Character Design Process</h2>

<p>After defining what good design is, coming up with an idea, and finding references, you move directly to the design. The design of a character usually starts with:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Silhouette</strong>: The character's contour or general shape, influenced by proportions, outfit, equipment, hairstyle, head covering, and posture.</li>

<li><strong>Proportions</strong>: The relationship of sizes and shapes of different parts of an object to one another.</li>

<li><strong>Scale</strong>: The ratio of a character's size to a normal human. Sometimes expressed through the size of the head or non-real-life objects.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Examples of Iconic Designs</h3>

<p>Iconic designs are often recognizable by their silhouette and proportions. Examples include the AK-47 and Vespa scooters. In character design, examples from games like Team Fortress 2 and Overwatch are notable.</p>

<h2>Design Elements</h2>

<h3>Silhouette, Proportions, and Scale</h3>

<p>These elements are the foundation of character design. They are usually the first things viewers notice and interpret.</p>

<h3>Facial Features and Emotions</h3>

<p>Facial features and emotions are the most direct indicators of a character's emotional state and intentions. The face is a powerful tool; even robots can gain personality by having a face.</p>

<h3>Pose and Body Language</h3>

<p>Pose and body language can tell you about a character's personality, mood, and backstory. For example, a specific grip on a gun or glasses pulled down on the nose.</p>

<h3>Outfit and Equipment</h3>

<p>Outfit and equipment help define the social status, profession, hobbies, and cultural belonging of a character. The absence of certain elements can also tell a story.</p>

<h3>Hair and Facial Vegetation</h3>

<p>Hair and facial vegetation can say a lot about a character's personality and lifestyle and can express individuality.</p>

<h3>Feature Traits</h3>

<p>Scars, tattoos, prosthetics, etc., can tell a character's unique story, their past, or even their accomplishments and losses.</p>

<h3>Color Palette</h3>

<p>The use of certain colors can carry an emotional load and suggest a psychological state or belonging to a certain group or ideology.</p>

<h2>Practical Application</h2>

<h3>Prioritizing Design Elements</h3>

<p>To understand how to prioritize design elements, your character's backstory and personality must be clearly defined. For example, stormtroopers are faceless soldiers, while Han Solo is a charismatic smuggler.</p>

<h3>Body Exposure and Iconography</h3>

<ul>

<li><strong>Body Exposure</strong>: How much of the character is open or closed and what parts of the body are exposed. This can serve both aesthetic and practical functions.</li>

<li><strong>Iconography</strong>: Activates ready-made symbols and images from the cultural code. For example, adding key attributes can turn an ordinary guy into a cowboy or a pirate.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Examples of Minor Changes</h3>

<p>Minor changes can significantly alter a character's perception. For example, changing a guy's clothes and adding a gun can turn him into a gangster, a mercenary, or a security guard.</p>

<p>The principles discussed are universal regardless of style or setting. The primary distinction is between grounded and entertainment designs. Entertainment design focuses on being engaging and often embraces stylization and exaggeration. The film industry gravitates towards realism, favoring more conservative and functional designs due to the physical realities of film production. Understanding these principles opens up more subtle ways to create characters whose appearance accurately reflects who they are.</p>
