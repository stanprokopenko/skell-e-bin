<p>I love to push <strong>foreshortening</strong> and experiment with <strong>wide-angle lens effects</strong> in my drawings. Building these skills can bring a new level of drama and depth to characters, creatures, and scenes. I often start by exploring basic forms, like cylinders and boxes, then gradually push them into more extreme perspectives. The key is learning to manipulate <em>scale</em>, <em>overlapping</em>, and <em>tapering</em>, then applying these ideas to the figure or any subject while maintaining a logical structure.</p>

<h2>Understanding Shape Changes</h2>

<p>I like to begin with a simple <strong>cylinder</strong> and view it from multiple side angles. If I keep it parallel to my line of sight, I see mostly a flat rectangle. But as I tilt it:</p>

<p>• The ellipses become more visible.<br />

• A cross-contour reveals its three-dimensional turn.<br />

• The front ellipse and back ellipse can match in size when there’s no perspective.<br />

• Tapering begins once I introduce perspective lines, one ellipse appears larger, the other smaller.</p>

<h2>Scale and Overlaps</h2>

<p>When I push perspective, I change both <strong>scale</strong> and <strong>overlap</strong>:</p>

<ol>

<li><strong>Scale Change</strong>: If the front ellipse is bigger and the back ellipse smaller, I get a sense that the form stretches closely toward the viewer.  </li>

<li><strong>Overlap</strong>: Overlapping forms ramp up the sense of depth. For instance, if I draw the front ellipse partially in front of the back ellipse, the shape looks more foreshortened.</li>

</ol>

<p>The more I exaggerate these two factors, the stronger the <strong>foreshortening</strong>. If I only enlarge one area and forget to scale other nearby forms, the drawing may look off-balance and disconnected.</p>

<h2>Applying It to the Figure</h2>

<p>I often treat limbs like <strong>cylinders</strong>. For a reaching arm:</p>

<p>• If I see the arm in a mild foreshortening, I’ll let the shoulder and wrist cylinders stay close in size.<br />

• For a very dramatic effect, I’ll draw that shoulder cylinder much larger and the wrist cylinder much smaller, overlapping the shapes along the way.<br />

• I also account for anatomy. A real forearm tapers from elbow to wrist, so I need to thicken the elbow area if I’m exaggerating scale too much in the wrist.</p>

<p>I usually decide if I want to start from the front (the large, close form) or from the back (the smaller, distant form). Sometimes I prefer to build from the torso and work outward to the limb that’s closest to me.</p>

<h2>Top-Down vs. Up Angle Shots</h2>

<p>Experimenting with <strong>camera angles</strong> opens up tons of possibilities:</p>

<h3>Top-Down</h3>

<p>If I imagine looking down on a figure, the <strong>head</strong> or shoulders might be large in the foreground, while the hips and feet tuck away beneath. Often the torso overlaps the pelvis entirely, hiding it from view. This can create a powerful sense of the figure leaning toward us.</p>

<h3>Up Angle</h3>

<p>Placing the “camera” below the figure looking up is a challenge but fun to push. The <strong>feet</strong> become large in the foreground, and the head looks small, high above. Sometimes arms or knees boldly overlap the torso, drawing the viewer’s eye towards them. This angle can give characters a towering or heroic feel.</p>

<h2>Pushing the Extremes</h2>

<p>I like to try wild thumbnails in my sketchbook, enormous heads tapering to tiny legs, or wide shoulders with a foreshortened torso. Some sketches might look overdone. Other times I find a sweet spot that feels right. This ongoing experimentation helps me discover more dynamic silhouettes and proportions. It’s a constant balance of realism and stylized distortion.</p>

<h2>Building Confidence</h2>

<p>There’s no shortcut to mastering these ideas. I do <strong>many</strong> drawings, switch angles, compare references, and analyze how lenses distort subjects in actual photos. Then I try to reconstruct those images with my own shapes. If I see something looks stiff or “safe,” I push the scale differences or overlaps a bit more. When it starts to feel convincing, I add details.</p>

<h3>Influence and Inspiration</h3>

<p>I study artists who draw extreme angles and wild perspectives. Some drill boxes and cylinders are right on the page without any layout lines. Others prefer to block in shapes with precise geometry first. I’ve found both methods valuable. The more comfortable I get with basic forms, the easier it is to freehand figures in perspective, just as jazz musicians improvise after mastering fundamental scales.</p>

<h2>Finishing Touches</h2>

<p>Once I’m satisfied with the overall structure, I add smaller details, such as hands, facial expressions, clothing wrinkles, and props. These extra elements help confirm the sense of depth, but I keep perspective lines in mind and make sure everything follows the same foreshortened logic.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p>Foreshortening and wide-angle sketching are about <strong>pushing scale</strong>, <strong>overlaps</strong>, and <strong>tapering</strong> until you hit that dramatic view you want. I start with cylinders or boxes, I adapt them to the anatomy I’m drawing, then I experiment with bigger or smaller proportions. At first, it’s natural to be hesitant, nobody wants to break their figure. But the more I play with these extremes, the more I discover fresh ways to convey depth and energy. Good luck and enjoy exploring these perspectives in your own sketches!</p>
