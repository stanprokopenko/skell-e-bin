<h2>Planning 3D Objects on a Flat Surface</h2>

<p>Drawing three-dimensional objects on a flat piece of paper can be challenging. <strong>Architects and designers</strong> plan complex forms by breaking them down into simpler, flat <strong>orthographic views</strong>, or <strong>orthos</strong>. These straight-on views help you visualize the object's dimensions and proportions.</p>

<h2>Orthographic Views (Orthos): Zero-Point Perspective</h2>

<p>Orthos are <strong>zero-point perspective</strong> drawings, like maps, showing the object from the most direct views possible. They typically include any of six straight-on views:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Front</strong></li>

<li><strong>Back</strong></li>

<li><strong>Left Side</strong></li>

<li><strong>Right Side</strong></li>

<li><strong>Top</strong></li>

<li><strong>Bottom</strong></li>

</ul>

<p>By combining these views, you gain comprehensive information about the object's shape and size.</p>

<h2>From Orthos to One-Point Perspective</h2>

<p>When you introduce depth to an ortho by tilting it into space, it becomes an <strong>oblique view</strong>. In this case, you can use <strong>one-point perspective</strong> to create the illusion of depth. One-point perspective involves lines converging to a single <strong>vanishing point</strong> on the <strong>horizon line</strong>.</p>

<h3>Convergence and Diminution</h3>

<ul>

<li><strong>Convergence</strong>: Lines that move away from you converge at the vanishing point, like the rails of a railroad track meeting at the horizon.</li>

<li><strong>Diminution</strong>: Objects appear smaller as they get further away, so heights and widths diminish with distance.</li>

</ul>

<p>In one-point perspective, lines going left to right or up and down remain parallel, while depth lines converge.</p>

<h2>Assignment: Draw Your Name in One-Point Perspective</h2>

<p>Try drawing your name or something you care about into deep space using one-point perspective. Start with a straight-on view of your name, then extend lines from the corners to a single vanishing point to create depth. This <strong>extrudes a flat front plane</strong> into a three-dimensional form.</p>

<h2>Exploring One-Point Perspective</h2>

<p>One-point perspective is powerful yet simple. It allows you to make flat drawings look three-dimensional with just one vanishing point. Experiment with it to create a sense of depth in your drawings. <strong>One amazing point is all you need for 3D.</strong></p>
