<h2>Painting Completion and Reflection</h2>

<p>I returned to the studio after some rest to review the painting from last night. I feel it's mostly complete for the demonstration. I'm satisfied with the face and overall composition, but I'm considering adding a few color notes for interest. Before moving to the next lesson, I want to leave the painting as an example of what can be achieved in one sitting.</p>

<h2>Choice of Reference and Beginner Guidance</h2>

<p>I plan to explain the choice of reference for beginners, addressing a common issue students face in workshops. It's important to guide them in selecting references that are manageable and instructive.</p>

<h2>Enhancing Abstract Elements</h2>

<p>I noticed a suggestion of a shape in the corner, which I accidentally created. I decided to enhance it for an abstract feel. I aim to be transparent about every step, adding color notes in the background for interest.</p>

<h2>Color Mixing and Palette</h2>

<p>I use a large brush, despite needing new ones, and I dislike ordering art supplies online. I mix colors without black, aiming for a brighter note. I use a combination of "ketchup and mustard" to create an orange hue and experiment with yellow ocher and black to create a green tone. My decisions are based on intuition rather than a specific rationale. The painting uses only two colors, which is impressive and should be noted.</p>

<h2>Creating Variety and Interest</h2>

<p>Variety is crucial to maintaining viewer interest and preventing the painting from being boring. I look for spots near the head to add variety with harder edges, avoiding uniformity. I mix green with black and yellow, adding a touch of orange for a semi-hard edge near the ear. I focus on creating variety with edges, likening them to musical notes that enhance the painting's interest.</p>

<h2>Portrait of Ethan Espinosa</h2>

<p>The painting features a portrait of Ethan Espinosa, a friend and artist, who allowed me to use his likeness. I discuss the challenge of making portraits of unknown people interesting through painting techniques. As a fine artist, I worried about selling portraits of unknown individuals, unlike recognizable figures like Arnold Schwarzenegger. Artists often avoid direct eye contact in portraits to make them more relatable and less specific. However, I enjoy painting eye contact, imagining historical significance in portraits.</p>

<h2>Appeal and Techniques</h2>

<p>The painting's appeal lies in how it's painted, not just the subject, making it desirable to collectors. I add color notes to emphasize the limited palette and create the illusion of more colors. The painting was created with a limited palette, using graded colors to mimic realistic skin tones. Adding pure color enhances the painting's realism and showcases the potential of a limited palette. Introducing blue to the palette would expand the color range significantly.</p>

<h2>Importance of Fundamental Elements</h2>

<p>Limiting the palette forces reliance on fundamental painting tools like shapes, values, edges, and color. I emphasize the importance of design, drawing, and other elements in creating a strong painting.</p>

<h2>Artistic Adjustments</h2>

<p>I add a sharp edge behind the head for contrast, deviating from the photo for artistic effect. I adjust Ethan's hair in the painting to correct a shape I disliked in the photo, ensuring it aligns with his hairstyle.</p>
