<h2>Working with Professional Clients vs Personal Projects</h2>

<p>When working with a professional client, the main difference compared to making stuff for myself is generally <strong>readability</strong>. I want things to be clear to someone else besides myself, my ideas need to be understandable.</p>

<p>For client work, especially when it comes to thumbnails, the artwork needs to be <strong>clean</strong>, and the concepts, how I'm posing the characters and what the composition is, need to read more clearly. When I'm making something for myself, it can be messy. It can just be notes for me to remember what I want to do, scribbled in the margins. But for clients, I need to present myself well.</p>

<p>I make every option that I present to them look <strong>appealing</strong> and <strong>viable</strong> as a choice. Internally, when I make thumbnails for a client, I want every option to be something that I'd be happy to work on if they choose it. That way, I don't get stuck with one that I hate and don't actually want to draw. I strive to be completely <strong>unbiased</strong> on the quality of each thumbnail so I'm not pushing them in any direction. They can decide what they want their artwork to accomplish, and the options from me are just saying, "Do you want to go in this direction, this direction, so on and so forth."</p>

<h2>Translating Characters into My Style</h2>

<h3>Initial Exploration</h3>

<p>The next example I'd like to share is the key art I did for <strong>Sea of Stars</strong>. This may be the game you guys know me for. When they approached me, they already had these two characters designed and had this idea for their key art, this thumbnail here. They asked me if I could draw it in my style, and use this composition. So I said, "Sure, I'll figure it out." I'll give you options. Let's play with things.</p>

<p>The first step was <strong>translating those characters into my style</strong>. I started with this kind of initially chibi look to kind of match the sprites, but I personally felt like it was a strain to do that, that didn't really feel like what I would draw. So I did more exploration. I kept drawing them until I felt like it achieved what they look like as a sprite, but was something that appealed to me.</p>

<p>Just like with the cat research that I mentioned earlier, this part was for me to play and get a feeling for the characters. I had no idea what the story was, but just doing these poses of their facial expressions helped me characterize who they are and made them a bit more human. When it's just a sprite, there's nothing going on here. Humanizing them helped me connect with the characters. I felt like they were people, and that helps me kind of know what I think the story should be.</p>

<p>Games are big collaborative processes. So me bringing my emotions into the character and trying to make them come to life as people, I'm just going to give what I can. And if the director doesn't like it, I'll try something else.</p>

<h3>Playing with Color</h3>

<p>Next, I started <strong>playing with color</strong>. This was literally just researching, from here to what they might look like in a final piece, getting familiar with their color palette. It's just easier and usually better to do it separately from the final piece, that you're aiming to do.</p>

<p>A lot of times I see students who try to do everything, all the design work, all the color palette, the entire process, on the piece itself. I'm guilty myself, too. But if you do that, the piece will take forever, because so much of it just hasn't been figured out up here. Like you don't know what their geometry is. If you're designing a character for the first time, you're deciding what their design is, and you're posing them in a scene, and then you have to decide what the scene is and what they're doing in the scene, what the story is.</p>

<p><strong>Do some of the work outside first.</strong> It'll usually go smoother.</p>

<h3>Developing Signature Poses</h3>

<p>These are the <strong>signature poses</strong> that they ended up using for a lot of promo art. These were just five-minute doodles, maybe not five minutes, maybe like fifteen minutes, but I didn't know they would be important or useful. I was just, like I said, figuring out what I think their poses are, and how I think it would be dynamic to move them around.</p>

<p>I want to call this out because I ended up deciding that these poses would be used for a later piece of artwork because they became used so often that it was something that a lot of audiences would be more familiar with.</p>

<h2>Creating Thumbnails for the Key Art</h2>

<p>At the thumbnail stage for the <strong>Sea of Stars</strong> key art, I started with what they asked for, which is this really wide composition in which we see a big moon, a really important location in the piece, and our characters are in the distance, looking longingly over this cliff. I feel like this is a composition that you've seen before, but that's what they were thinking. So this is that option.</p>

<p>Whenever I do key art or illustrations for people, I usually give them at least these four options to show them a range of what they might expect from me.</p>

<h3>Option 1: Original Concept</h3>

<p>The first option was exactly what they asked for, a wide composition with characters looking away, big moon, important location.</p>

<h3>Option 2: Slight Variation</h3>

<p>The second option was, "Okay, I'm not going to veer too far away from what you asked for, but here's a maybe slightly more dynamic camera angle of the same concept." So the characters are just closer to the viewer. We get a closer look at what they look like. Maybe it feels a little bit more personal. Just trying to iterate on their idea to give them something different.</p>

<h3>Option 3: Emphasizing the Characters</h3>

<p>The third option, which, if you've seen the artwork before, you know this is the one they selected, I personally felt like I wanted to see the characters' faces. The two previous ones are looking away from us, not very personal, even if it does feel adventurous. Knowing the tone that they were going for based off of what they were asking, I tried to capture that feeling but add my sense of what the artwork was missing, which is getting to see their faces.</p>

<p>It also gave me a chance to pose them in a way where we get a little greater sense of their personalities as individuals, as opposed to just their backs, which is very hard to accomplish sometimes. To include the elements that they said were important in this initial thumbnail, which is this tower and these buildings, I planned to have them to the sides.</p>

<p>Anytime you give your client another option, you still want to maintain everything they asked for. You don't want to go completely out on a limb, at least with several of the options you give them.</p>

<p>That was this concept. It has the sea, and it has the stars, and it has a big moon like they were thinking.</p>

<h3>Option 4: A Bold Departure</h3>

<p>The last option, unlike what I just said, is usually me going off the wall crazy. So it's like, "Okay, maybe you don't know what you want, client, and I'm going to throw something at you that maybe I think could be fun." I might even prefer a different option, but this is literally just to throw out contrast. Sometimes this option is even the <strong>opposite</strong> of what they were originally envisioning, which in this case it is.</p>

<p>Instead of very far away characters, primarily background-focused, I made it almost entirely <strong>character-focused</strong>. I've made space for the background elements, like I said, just to give them what they asked for. But instead, I was like, "What if we make it just about them being big and large and up front?"</p>

<p>The game includes an element of night and day, so one side was going to be bright and sunny, and the other side was going to be nighttime with a moon in the center that was half eclipse and half sun, which, if you're familiar with the lore of the game, is something that happens.</p>

<p>Cut to the chase, they did pick that one.</p>

<h2>Developing the Chosen Thumbnail into Final Art</h2>

<h3>First Line Art Pass</h3>

<p>Next is the <strong>line art</strong> for that piece. If you are familiar with the final line art, you know this is not what it looks like. They gave me a pretty quick turnaround, I think it was like a week and a half that they asked me to be finished with this. They were ramping up for a Kickstarter, so they had a hard deadline that they wanted to set. So this is just my first pass.</p>

<p>Frankly, I was not happy with the way the faces turned out. And one of the adjustments they asked for personally was the design of this tower. They had asked for it to be a little bit more simple from my thumbnails here and here, but later they changed their minds: "Okay, this is a little bit too generic and boring."</p>

<h3>Flat Colors and Signature Elements</h3>

<p>Here are <strong>flats</strong> on that same initial line work. As I said before, trying to keep the color palette really as minimal as possible. We're using some of the same blues, the same beige. The <strong>signature colors</strong> on a character are really important at this stage. Her hair being this bright blue and his being blonde. Those might be things that you start with, just so that you know that those are their true colors. You choose everything else to complement it because you know you can't change the signature part of the color.</p>

<h3>Lighting Pass and Self-Critique</h3>

<p>This is a <strong>lighting pass</strong> on that same drawing. It's still not happy with it internally. I was thinking of having the light source be the sword and staff here, so that's how their shadows are lit. But if I'm critiquing myself, it's a little bit too intense and there's this giant moon behind them that is somehow not lighting them up.</p>

<h3>Revising the Line Art</h3>

<p>It bugged me so much that I didn't like the way they looked that I'm like, "Okay, I know I've already sent them passes that they were happy with, but internally I was just like, it wasn't what I was going for." So I did a new sketch where I got the characters to feel the way I want them to feel. I inked it, threw it back in there. I knew that the background elements could mostly stay the same, and then I replaced it.</p>

<p>You know, this is what happens in real life. You make something, you don't like it, you can change it. You're not stuck with it. Sometimes when it's for a client, it's a lot harder to change something. But in my case, I just improved it and they were like, "Sure, it looks better."</p>

<p>One thing that I will say is Valir's face here. They kind of liked how bold or aggressive she looked in the previous version. So they did ask for a change on this. She just gets a little bit more fierce in the eyebrows.</p>

<h3>Finalizing the Artwork</h3>

<p>The next step is the <strong>shadow pass</strong>. There's a little bit of light work put in, but really just coloring in the lines of my line work to make sure that the sword feels like it's illuminating compared to this artwork in which it's kind of a sunset moving towards a darker blue color scheme.</p>

<p>Having more blues feels more <strong>sea</strong>. Having more contrast helps you see more <strong>stars</strong>. Frankly, at this point in development, I don't really know much about anything besides what these characters look like. Making it so the artwork evokes the title of the game is kind of one of those brain-dead simple concepts that the audience will feel like, "Oh, okay, I get it." They don't have to be confused at, "The name is Sea of Stars, but I don't see sea or stars." Just <strong>speaking to what the product is</strong> sometimes is the simplest, best solution. So that's what motivated the color scheme.</p>

<p>Here's what I turned in to them as my final version for this initial pass. You'll see I did more light work, adding a little bit of glow on things, coloring in the hair light, which is the edges of the character here, just adding more atmosphere with some of the glowing flowers.</p>

<p>I believe I added these flowers from here. I did at least here. There was nothing going on over here. It was just like rocks and cracks. And I added the flowers just to add a little bit more visual interest. And then later I decided they should be <strong>glowing flowers</strong> because that looks cooler. It kind of adds some visual interest just to spice things up.</p>

<h2>Adjusting the Artwork Based on Client Feedback</h2>

<h3>Extending the Composition</h3>

<p>The process for this piece is after I turned it in, they were like, "It's cool, but it's so zoomed in that they can't use it for all the sizing that the artwork needed to accomplish." You know, like if it's on a webpage that's really wide, they need the artwork to be wider.</p>

<p>This is one of the most "ugh" feelings in the world when the client asks for something like, "Can you just do, like, more? Can you just, like, extend?" That's what they asked for. They're always really cool to work with, so I did it even though it's something normally I'm like, "Ugh."</p>

<p>They literally gave me the new dimensions. These red outlines here are my plan for how I would extend it. I ended up having to think about what would be interesting to put here. You know, I don't want just more generic mountain. Having seen some of the screenshots that they had, I saw that there are these large characters that have faces as big as mountains. So I'm thinking, "Maybe we can add that there." Similarly, I saw there was another giant goblin character. So maybe I can hide him there. Just more city is fine.</p>

<p>So that was my plan.</p>

<h3>Experimenting with the Background</h3>

<p>This is the next turn in on the artwork, but you'll notice it's a little different. I assumed that with so much real estate on the top that maybe I can try an option where the moon is above everybody. And that way I could play with the stars being kind of the highlight. So more Milky Way look. I was like, it's fun. I had fun doing it. Probably a move that was mostly for my own exploration of drawing Milky Way.</p>

<p>They didn't go for it. They're like, "No, put the moon back in the middle. It makes the characters pop out more. It's better." I agree. But, you know, I played with something here.</p>

<h3>Final Delivery</h3>

<p>So this is the final artwork. You can see the large characters here that I added. Yeah, it went pretty well for them.</p>

<h2>Creating the Sea of Stars Art Book Cover</h2>

<h3>Thumbnails and Development</h3>

<p>So the last one I'll do today for my process is the <strong>Sea of Stars</strong> art book. I'm going to jump in with thumbnails because obviously I'm very familiar with the characters by this point. I don't have to do any research. I've done research for four years.</p>

<p>So here are my thumbnails. And the thing that you'll notice that's different is these are a lot more developed because I knew the cover was going to have a <strong>gold element</strong>. So keeping in mind what would be cool as gold, that's the sort of thing where if you don't think it ahead of time, it'll really suck to add it later or it might not make sense later.</p>

<p>This is a callback to the initial key art option that they really liked actually. So we talked about it and I was like, "Well, maybe we can use it here."</p>

<h3>Selecting the Final Concept</h3>

<p>This option is what they ended up picking. The idea is it reused poses very similar to those initial poses that they liked the most and kind of used the most on social media. Maybe it's an image that a lot of people associate with the game. So choosing an image intentionally that will remind people that they've seen it before, as opposed to something completely they're unfamiliar with. Even if they haven't played the game, if they've seen those characters in those poses, they might be like, "Huh, my brain is more interested because I might know what this is." That was the intent with reusing those poses slightly altered and with all the additional characters in the back.</p>

<h3>Other Concepts</h3>

<p>This next option is again playing with the idea of showing the stars and the sea so that it is advertising what it is.</p>

<p>The last one is the publisher asked to have a gold circle in the middle for the title, right? Like you've seen that on the other options. And for this composition, I wanted to make that the focal point where gold is emanating from that circle.</p>

<p>And lastly, this one was my wife's idea, actually, where there's an <strong>eclipse</strong> idea throughout the game, and she just thought it'd be cool to use that to highlight the title. An eclipse being a highlight like hair light. I used that motif on the characters to have them pop up.</p>

<h3>Finalizing the Art Book Cover</h3>

<p>I'm going to go through this real quick. Here's the initial line art of the piece. You'll notice a few things. Zale's face, I ended up not liking and redoing. Some other things, I ended up redoing as well.</p>

<p>Here's the initial pass at masking things out, thinking about how gold might be used.</p>

<p>Here are <strong>flats</strong> in which we start to use the local color of the characters as closely as possible. And again, using that limited color palette to keep things cohesive as well as get things done faster.</p>

<p>Here's the next step in which I was playing with the gold foil, being more of a highlight on the characters using stars. You might not see it very easily, but this is like kind of, these were supposed to evoke waves was what I was going for.</p>

<p>Continuing to iterate. So here I have some shadow on the main characters and the highlight that's gold. This one adding that highlight to the background and the characters just to like pop them out from the background as well.</p>

<p>And the final delivery in which, very importantly, <strong>the logo balances out some of the other gold elements</strong>. And that's how I did this piece.</p>

<h2>My General Process Overview</h2>

<p>As you can see, each one is a little different. Like, you know, if I'm familiar with something, I don't need to research it. If I am not familiar, then I'll do a bunch of research. So it just depends.</p>

<p>But generally speaking, my process goes as follows:</p>

<ol>

<li><strong>Research</strong>: To get familiar with what I'm going to draw.</li>

<li><strong>Thumbnails</strong>: To figure out if I like certain compositions or stories.</li>

<li><strong>Line Art</strong>: To just draw the thing.</li>

<li><strong>Flats</strong>: Starting to think about color palette and how to make things cohesive.</li>

<li><strong>Shading</strong>: To finish up the piece and make it all cohesive.</li>

</ol>

<p>So that's a summary of my process.</p>
