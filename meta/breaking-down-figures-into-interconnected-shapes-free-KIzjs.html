<h2>What's in Premium?</h2>

<p>We dive into the <strong>part-to-part approach</strong> for figure drawing, focusing on connecting body parts to understand spatial relationships. You'll learn how to adjust basic shapes to match the model, use overlaps and wrapping lines for depth, and apply S and C curves to draw limbs naturally. We also cover strategies for handling foreshortening by breaking down limbs into parts. This method helps you set up figures quickly and accurately for detailed drawings.</p>
