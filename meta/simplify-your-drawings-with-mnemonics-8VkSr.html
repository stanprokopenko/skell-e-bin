<p>Hi everyone, my name is Bryce Ko, and today I'm going to show you how to research an object that you don't know how to draw and that you might not even have a great photo of.</p>

<h2>The Mnemonic Approach</h2>

<p>When I need to draw something unfamiliar, I like to use a <strong>mnemonic approach</strong>. This means I liken pieces I don't understand to things I'm familiar with. It makes it easier to grasp what I'm looking at and helps me remember the shapes when I'm drawing.</p>

<h2>Breaking Down a Bike into Familiar Shapes</h2>

<p>Bikes are <strong>so hard</strong> to draw. I really don't enjoy drawing bikes, but they look cool and add a lot of personality and atmosphere to a piece. So let's give it our best shot.</p>

<h3>The Front as a Helmet with Antlers</h3>

<p>In the photo I'm working from, the front of the bike looks like the front of a biker helmet to me. Thinking of it that way, like a <strong>sharp helmet with horns</strong> or <strong>antler ears</strong> sticking out, helps me remember the shape. If I can just get something close, that's great.</p>

<p>So I imagine an <strong>alien helmet</strong> with antler ears. That's a shape I can remember because I've thought of it in terms I already know. If I ever want to draw a helmet again, I know I'm just drawing a human head shape with those large ears and antlers.</p>

<h3>Humanizing the Bike's Body</h3>

<p>Continuing that metaphor, I think of the <strong>neck</strong> and <strong>chest</strong> of this character. The <strong>license plate</strong> becomes the <strong>collarbone</strong>, and the <strong>lights</strong> are like the <strong>pecs</strong> on a chest. On these speedier-looking bikes, the chest comes to a more flat face.</p>

<p>I start thinking about how the design is implemented on a bike. The piece of machinery that connects to the wheel is like the <strong>stomach</strong> of our armor that's been hollowed out. When I'm drawing, I remember that I'm drawing this piece with the intention of a wheel being either laid into it or jutting out from it.</p>

<h2>Understanding and Simplifying Complex Parts</h2>

<h3>The Wheel as Underwear</h3>

<p>From another angle, the shape looks like <strong>underwear</strong>. So the bike's body is like the <strong>torso</strong>, and the area where the wheel fits is like underwear that houses the wheel. I'm not going to do anything with the wheel, come on, guys, I can only go so far!</p>

<p>I know from experience that on top of the wheel, there's usually a cover. That's not conceptually difficult for me to understand that needs to happen. So from the top view, the shape looks like this, and that's underwear. These are legs, and the long crotch leads up to the torso. This is my <strong>Titan</strong>.</p>

<h3>Visual Texture and Mechanical Details</h3>

<p>I wish I knew the language for these parts, I must sound so silly, but there are different <strong>cylinders</strong>, <strong>extrusions</strong>, and <strong>screws</strong>. This is visual <strong>language</strong> or <strong>texture</strong> that I might study and memorize, then literally copy and paste anywhere, I don't know what I should be doing. It will make it look cool, and it might be convincing enough.</p>

<p>For example, the inner part of the tire, the <strong>hubcap</strong> or whatever, is so varied that you don't have to memorize an exact one to <strong>get away with it</strong>. You might want to study the one you're looking at, to get some ideas for relationships or pieces that make sense there.</p>

<h3>Detailing Tires and Wheels</h3>

<p><strong>Tire textures</strong> are generally all the same insofar as, for an illustration, we only really need to remember that it has a pattern and usually a middle area. I'm not doing a fantastic job here, but this is research where I'm noting these are the things to remember to include.</p>

<h2>Filling in the Gaps</h2>

<p>Both of these bikes have a really big <strong>butt</strong> for storage, I assume. It's just this <strong>suitcase thing</strong> connected via some rods. Sometimes, we don't see enough to make educated guesses at what it should be, but knowing that the shape ends with a somewhat larger rounded-off box might be enough.</p>

<p>If I'm drawing it from an angle and think it just ends in a big box, as well as some kickstand-type pieces, that might be sufficient. I might assume there's a wheel much like the front one on the back. I'm missing the middle section, but if I literally just connect the dots and fill in this middle area with pieces of what I'm seeing, I get the rough idea of a bike, and that might be enough for my drawing to be convincing.</p>

<h2>The Importance of Research</h2>

<p>That was a breakdown of how I do research. Just remember, guys, that this is a step you <strong>don't want to skip</strong> because it's building that foundational knowledge you're going to use to play with when you get to the illustration. It's actually fun to draw from imagination.</p>
