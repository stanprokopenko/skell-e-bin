<h2>Sketchbook Pages</h2>

<p>For years, I kept sketchbooks, from about the age of 40 to 45. I did hundreds of drawings, often becoming a social misfit as I bowed out of conversations to immerse myself in my sketchbook. But if you're willing to do that, the reward is the ability to draw as exploration, without planning. You become comfortable drawing without knowing what's going to happen as long as you're willing to make your sketchbooks places for experiments, not showcases.</p>

<p>Perhaps I overdid it, but this habit helped me <strong>overcome the fear of the blank page</strong>. I'd like to share some of these sketchbook pages that are relevant to what I'm trying to teach here, which is about <strong>process</strong>.</p>

<h2>Drawing Without Separate Stages</h2>

<p>None of these drawings were done with stages requiring separate paper. They were all done on a single piece of paper, though there were stages involved. The first stage is to <strong>start lightly and very loosely</strong>, and then as the image begins to sharpen in your imagination, you gradually bear down. So these drawings do have stages, but they are spontaneous.</p>

<p>Usually, I get an idea for something or see something and just want to get it down on paper while it's fresh in my mind. About half of these drawings are purely from imagination, and about half are responses to things I observed, like the Thunder Beast at the Natural History Museum. I spent much time with it and once imagined it as machinery, which is a good way to learn anatomy.</p>

<p>Something like this would take an hour or more because I go in and include the shading. But it started with very light lines to place the shapes so that they look like they are going around a ball. I have a thing for <strong>radial symmetry</strong>, so a good chunk of my sketchbook was filled with explorations of radial symmetry.</p>

<p>There's more rendering than I wish sometimes because we're going to have a bit of a rule in our assignments, <strong>you don't shade things in until you really know the forms, you earn the right to shade</strong>.</p>

<p>These drawings have all been done with graphite pencils, mechanical pencils, the regular kind. There's nothing special about the medium. But after thousands of hours with mechanical pencils, I grew tired of what I loved about them, which is that they can gradate. There's something about having a steel pen in walnut ink and just digging into the paper, not knowing how the form is going to come out, that really excites me now.</p>

<p>This one on the right was true <strong>improv</strong>. Pencils are wonderful because you can gradate with them, you can erase them, and you can also go back over them in ink and then later erase the pencil lines so that the ink is very clean. But there is something about just starting with the ink that can make a piece come alive when it does.</p>

<p>With me, for every one of these that works, I do about 99 that don't. But I just love that <strong>wildness and risk</strong> and the line quality that comes with traditional steel pens, or grass pens, or bird quill pens, the kind that spread when you press them down.</p>

<h3>The Secret Behind Drawing with Ink</h3>

<p>But about this problem of throwing down ink lines, permanent, messy, wet media, and hoping for something good to happen, there is a secret behind it: <strong>learn to draw first</strong>.</p>

<p>I want to show you one of the first drawings I ever did where I felt like I had some genuine craft with spontaneity in a way that relates to what we'll learn in this perspective course.</p>

<p>It is these two faces. They're very small, not much bigger than your thumbnail, done with a rollerball pen. Even though I remember doing them back in the late '90s at the LA Zoo, I don't remember anything about the actual process of drawing because I was in a state of having looked at these apes for a bit and realized that either one of them could kill me without increasing their heart rate and sleep fine tonight. It was the emotional experience and the intensity in these faces that made me put my rollerball down and fling lines around in response.</p>

<p>It was only after, when I scanned them in and blew them up, that I was aware that I was thinking of those muzzles as spheres with lines on them, and that the lower lip is an up plane as it goes around, and that the folds of skin on the muzzle crunch together around the outside, as lines on spheres tend to do.</p>

<p>What I'm saying is that this drawing was done entirely with <strong>subconscious awareness</strong> of the placement of the lines, and <strong>emotional involvement</strong> with the animals. When we are working, we should not be thinking about our craft, so much as what it is we are trying to do with our craft. What it is we are looking at or imagining. If it's not impressive, that's fine. It did its job, and it got us there. But I think sometimes, often, our best work comes when we don't have to think too hard about craft.</p>

<h2>Learning from Other Artists</h2>

<p>Different artists have different approaches. Let me show you two who work freely and with skill but in different ways.</p>

<h3>Simon Goinard</h3>

<p>I'll start with Simon Goinard because I admire his wild lines. Here's what he says about it:</p>

<blockquote>

<p><strong>"Produce with your mind. Always have an idea in place. Never draw with a blank mind. It's not worth the time. Think your lines, every line, before you touch the paper."</strong></p>

</blockquote>

<p>Good thinking can yield such a result.</p>

<h3>Justin Sweet</h3>

<p>But I want to show you an opposite approach by Justin Sweet. I know that they don't really fit a perspective course, but they do fit our topic of pushing the process to extremes. When Justin did these, I asked him if he would write something for my students about how he did them.</p>

<p>He wrote:</p>

<blockquote>

<p><strong>"It's one of those things that you paint quickly right from the gut. No thinking. And watercolor in this style lets lots of the image stay in my imagination. When it gets defined too much, it leaves."</strong></p>

</blockquote>

<p>Well, that is the most extreme of any of my colleagues. Can you tell that before Justin did this watercolor, he knew something about this tendon connecting to the heel bone? That takes <strong>study first, then breaking loose with skill</strong>.</p>

<h2>Two Approaches to Drawing</h2>

<p>Let's review. Two ways of working:</p>

<ol>

<li>

<p><strong>Careful stages</strong> - planned out, solving one thing at a time, thought through. Though at least one of those stages, typically at the beginning, should not be thought through. It should be brainstormed and played with in many variations. You can use vellum or the computer to get you out of your unglamorous variations and struggles, to find what works.</p>

</li>

<li>

<p><strong>Improv</strong>: where we take risks and are willing to make mistakes. But as Ralph Steadman said:</p>

<blockquote>

<p><strong>"There are no mistakes, there are only opportunities to do something else, something new, something different."</strong></p>

</blockquote>

</li>

</ol>

<p>In this course, we will lean toward working in stages because it is the sensible and professional way to work, especially when you are working with other people so that they can see the stages and work with you. But it may be that <strong>your greatest work will happen over here</strong>, in improv, and all of this course is aimed toward giving you the skills to do that.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p>So let's begin with the simplest possible drawing skill that an artist can develop: <strong>the ability to draw a straight line</strong>.</p>
