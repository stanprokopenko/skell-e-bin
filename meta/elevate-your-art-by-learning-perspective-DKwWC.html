<h2>Learning from Modern Artists</h2>

<p>Let's explore how early 21st-century artists work and learn a few lessons from them.</p>

<h2>Wes Wheeler: Blending Drawing and 3D Modeling</h2>

<p>Wes Wheeler is a 3D artist who <strong>draws before modeling</strong>, then draws over the models to make them look drawn again. This approach <strong>cheats time</strong> and benefits the viewer. Importantly, he <strong>works out multiple options</strong> before committing to one.</p>

<h2>Understanding 3D Modeling and Perspective</h2>

<p>Building 3D models requires knowledge of a 3D program, not necessarily perspective. However, the program uses perspective, so it's important to <strong>think like a 3D program</strong>. Learning to sketch with <strong>3D awareness</strong> enhances your skills.</p>

<h2>Polina Ristova: Combining Traditional and Digital Methods</h2>

<p>Polina Ristova designed Dracula's carriage by studying funeral cars, drawing thumbnails, and creating orthographic drawings. She then built it in Maya to make her own custom reference and drew a new version on paper. She says, <strong>"We use 3D programs to get to our result faster, not as an excuse not to learn the basics."</strong></p>

<h2>Vance Kovacs: Exploring Options with Digital Tools</h2>

<p>Vance Kovacs, a concept artist for movies, often starts with rough sketches to work out composition and perspective choices. He <strong>explores options</strong> and doesn't settle for the first try. Digital tools allow him to <strong>track stages</strong> and adjust as needed.</p>

<h2>Israel Sanchez: Different Approaches to Perspective</h2>

<p>Israel Sanchez works in illustration, children's books, advertising, comics, and TV animation. His work shows two approaches to perspective: <strong>traditional perspective</strong> that looks right and <strong>whimsical perspective</strong> that appears childlike. Knowing perspective allows you to <strong>defy it when appropriate</strong>, enhancing the desired effect.</p>

<h2>Choosing Your Approach</h2>

<p>Decide how you work based on what you're trying to achieve. Whether you want your art to look playful or convincing, <strong>working in stages</strong> helps solve one problem at a time. Professionals like Israel, Vance, Polina, and Wes are <strong>not held back by lack of skill</strong> because they've built a strong foundation.</p>

<h2>Dan Fraga: Mastery Without Planning</h2>

<p>Dan Fraga demonstrated drawing without any planning, showcasing his skill developed over years in comics. While impressive, this <strong>off-road approach</strong> is <strong>dangerous for beginners</strong>.</p>

<p>Remember, we're here to <strong>learn perspective</strong>. Focus on building your skills first. <strong>Mastery leads to masterpieces</strong> later. Skills come before creating great art.</p>
