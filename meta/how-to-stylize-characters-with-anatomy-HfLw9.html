<p>Hi, I'm Elaine De Bayayan, a character designer and animator in the industry. Currently, I'm the lead character designer on <strong>"My Adventure as Superman"</strong> at Warner Brothers Animation. I've previously worked with Paramount, Powerhouse, The Line, and Marvel. My work tends to have a <strong>stylized approach</strong>, and I want to share insights on how you can use your <strong>anatomical knowledge</strong> to push your art and bring dynamism to your characters.</p>

<h2>The Importance of Foundation and Structure</h2>

<p>Understanding the <strong>foundation and structure</strong> of art is crucial, especially when stylizing. Resources like Proko are excellent for learning anatomy, which is essential for character design in animation. Even when creating stylized art, having a solid grasp of anatomy helps make your work more dynamic and personal.</p>

<h2>Starting with Gestural Sketches</h2>

<p>When starting a piece, I often begin with <strong>loose, gestural sketches</strong>. Sometimes, the initial sketch can be <strong>ugly</strong>, and that's okay. The key is to capture the movement and energy. For example, in one drawing of my original character, I focused on getting the hand in focus first, using perspective to add depth.</p>

<h2>Utilizing Perspective and Composition</h2>

<p>I'm a big fan of using <strong>perspective</strong> to set up compositions. It allows you to play around with space and can be a fun way to <strong>cheat</strong> a bit. Once you get the hang of perspective, you can plan out planes, composition, and blocking more easily. Studios like <strong>Trigger</strong>, <strong>Studio Mir</strong>, and shows like <strong>Avatar</strong> have been significant inspirations for me in this regard.</p>

<h2>Iterating and Refining Sketches</h2>

<p>I often iterate on my sketches, keeping as much of the <strong>original shapes</strong> as possible. Sometimes, I'll duplicate a sketch and refine it by erasing and redrawing parts. This process helps me maintain the initial energy while improving the overall structure. For dynamic poses, I may start with a rough idea and then adjust proportions and angles to enhance the pose.</p>

<h2>Using Reference and Mental Libraries</h2>

<p>While sometimes I draw from imagination, I also use <strong>reference</strong> extensively. Building a mental library of shapes and poses is invaluable. For dynamic poses, I might focus on having a leg, arm, or foot in the foreground. Resources like <strong>Pinterest</strong> are great for finding inspiring images, such as candid photography, magazine shoots, or dance videos, which offer excellent references for movement and blocking.</p>

<h2>Tools and Techniques</h2>

<h3>3D Models and Tracing</h3>

<p>I utilize tools like <strong>3D models</strong> in Clip Studio Paint to study heads and perspectives. Tracing over 3D models or using them as reference is perfectly acceptable, especially when working under tight deadlines. However, you must understand the underlying structures to make your work look authentic.</p>

<h3>Lasso Fill Tool</h3>

<p>One of my favorite tools is the <strong>lasso fill</strong> in Clip Studio, which allows me to block out shapes quickly. It's excellent for creating effects, filling in shading, and speeding up the drawing process, especially in animation.</p>

<h2>Incorporating Music into Animation</h2>

<p>Music often inspires my animations. I might hear a song that makes me want to move, and I'll translate that energy into an animation. Considering the musical aspect can make the animation feel more alive.</p>

<h2>Adapting to Different Styles</h2>

<p>Working in the industry often requires adapting to different styles. This means doing your homework, studying the <strong>proportions</strong>, <strong>ratios</strong>, and nuances of the style you're aiming to emulate. Even with a strong personal aesthetic, understanding these elements is essential to meet the demands of different projects.</p>

<h2>Emphasizing Anatomy and Practice</h2>

<p>Anatomy studies are fundamental. Everything in art comes down to the <strong>ratios and relationships</strong> between parts. By understanding structure and practicing regularly, like warming up with gestural sketches, you can make your work more dynamic and alive.</p>

<h2>Engaging with the Community</h2>

<p>Posting your work on social media can lead to unexpected opportunities. I once posted an animation of "Percy Jackson" during COVID, which led to my current job. Sharing fan art or work you're passionate about can catch the eye of industry professionals.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p>Drawing is like athleticism, the more you practice, the stronger your art becomes. By combining foundational knowledge of anatomy with your personal style, and utilizing tools and references, you can create dynamic, stylized art that resonates with others.</p>
