<h2>What's in Premium?</h2>

<p>In the premium lesson, Aaron Blaise shows how to break down complex animal anatomy into simple shapes and forms. You'll learn how to start with basic shapes—circles, squares, tubes—to construct the head, neck, shoulders, body, and hips of animals. Aaron demonstrates this technique by drawing a dog and a bear, emphasizing the importance of finding the rhythm and flow through the body. He explains how to build all the parts onto that line of action, simplifying legs into tubes and using concepts like the "chicken leg" for back legs. You'll see how to move and pose these simple shapes to create dynamic gestures and how to adapt proportions for different animals. This lesson lays a strong foundation for your drawings and prepares you for future topics like rotating shapes in 3D space.</p>
