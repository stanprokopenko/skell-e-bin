<h2>Setting Up the Grid and Horizon Line</h2>

<p>I start by drawing the <strong>horizon line</strong> in my image. To make the grid less prominent, I place two pages of vellum over it. This way, the grid becomes a whispered guide in the background.</p>

<h2>Constructing the Box</h2>

<p>I choose a <strong>front corner</strong> to keep the box within the picture frame. By setting the height of the box from this corner, I establish where my vanishing points are. With the <strong>three axes</strong> in place, I need to decide on the <strong>width and depth</strong> of the box.</p>

<p>I aim for a rectangle that's <strong>higher than it is wide</strong>. Since it's a wide-angle view, the front might appear skinnier. I test this by running the corners back to the vanishing points. After adjusting, I create a back rectangle that's <strong>tolerable in proportion</strong>.</p>

<h2>Defining the Anvil's Base and Proportions</h2>

<p>Using the <strong>ortho</strong> (orthographic projection), I find the <strong>halfway point</strong> in the box. I notice the base of the anvil sticks out <strong>in front of the halfway point</strong>. I estimate the position of the <strong>back and front feet</strong> of the anvil.</p>

<p>By running lines to the vanishing points and connecting dots, I check the proportions. The base forms a rectangle that's <strong>deeper than it is wide</strong>. I find the center of this rectangle using the <strong>X method</strong> and lift it up to the height of the base.</p>

<h2>Building the Anvil's Body and Horn</h2>

<p>In the center of the base, I construct a block that represents the <strong>elevated body</strong> of the anvil. I mark the position of the <strong>hanging end</strong>, which is about half the distance left to right in the center.</p>

<p>Using the ortho, I see that the body extends <strong>beyond the halfway point</strong>. I connect lines to form the <strong>shoulder</strong> and the <strong>horn</strong>. The horn reaches its peak slightly below the top and curves forward.</p>

<p>I use <strong>straight lines</strong> as guides but adjust them to reflect the <strong>curves</strong> of the anvil. The horn's center line isn't visible because it's slightly above us, so I focus on the contour lines.</p>

<h2>Refining Curves and Details</h2>

<p>I add <strong>cross-contour lines</strong> to define the curves of the anvil's body and horn. I pay attention to the point where the surface transitions from side to top, known as the <strong>terminator</strong>. This helps me capture the subtle changes in form.</p>

<p>At the base, I adjust the lines to reflect how the anvil curves down and spreads out. I erase unnecessary lines to reduce confusion and focus on the <strong>essential shapes</strong>.</p>

<h2>Finalizing the Drawing</h2>

<p>I darken the lines I intend to keep and erase the ones I don't need. This clarifies the form and makes the anvil stand out against the grid.</p>

<p>Throughout this process, I relied on the <strong>orthos</strong> and constructed the anvil within the box, navigating around the grid in 3D. This approach allows me to draw the anvil from eye level without directly referencing it in that exact position.</p>
