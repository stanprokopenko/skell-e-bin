<h2>Understanding the Difference Between Personal and Client Work</h2>

<p>When working with <strong>clients</strong>, the main difference from personal projects is the need for <strong>clarity</strong> and <strong>readability</strong>. While personal sketches can be messy and just for my own reference, client work must be <strong>clean</strong>, <strong>clear</strong>, and <strong>understandable</strong> to others. It's crucial that my ideas <strong>communicate effectively</strong>.</p>

<h2>Presenting Options to Clients</h2>

<p>I always aim to present options that are <strong>appealing</strong> and <strong>viable</strong>. Every thumbnail I show a client is something I'd be happy to develop further. I avoid including any options I'm not enthusiastic about. This way, I'm <strong>unbiased</strong> and let the client decide the direction they prefer.</p>

<h2>The Sea of Stars Key Art Example</h2>

<p>When I worked on the key art for <strong>Sea of Stars</strong>, the client provided their initial character designs and a rough composition. They asked me to <strong>draw it in my style</strong>. I began by <strong>translating their characters</strong> into my own style, exploring until I found a look that felt right.</p>

<h3>Exploring Poses and Expressions</h3>

<p>Even though I didn't know much about the story, drawing the characters in various poses and expressions helped me <strong>connect with them</strong>. This process <strong>humanized</strong> the characters and made them feel more real to me.</p>

<h2>Creating Thumbnails</h2>

<p>I provided the client with four different thumbnails:</p>

<ol>

<li><strong>Their Original Idea</strong>: A wide composition with the characters looking out over a cliff.</li>

<li><strong>A Dynamic Angle</strong>: Similar concept but with a more dynamic camera angle and the characters closer to the viewer.</li>

<li><strong>Focusing on the Characters</strong>: A composition showing the characters' faces and personalities, while including important background elements.</li>

<li><strong>An Alternative Approach</strong>: A bold option that was character-focused, featuring a split between day and night themes.</li>

</ol>

<p>They chose the third option, which allowed the viewer to see the characters' faces and personalities.</p>

<h2>The Iterative Process</h2>

<h3>Line Art and Color Flats</h3>

<p>I started with line art but wasn't satisfied with the initial faces. I revised them to better capture the characters' expressions. When adding color flats, I focused on their <strong>signature colors</strong> to keep the palette <strong>cohesive</strong>.</p>

<h3>Making Adjustments</h3>

<p>The client requested some changes, like adjusting the design of a tower in the background. I made personal adjustments too, like adding <strong>glowing flowers</strong> for visual interest. Even after the client approved, I wasn't afraid to <strong>improve</strong> the artwork if I felt it needed it.</p>

<h3>Adapting to Format Changes</h3>

<p>Later, the client needed the artwork adapted to a wider format. This required me to <strong>extend the composition</strong>, add new elements, and adjust the background to fit the new dimensions. It's important to be flexible and accommodate such requests.</p>

<h2>Planning for Final Output</h2>

<p>When working on projects like an art book cover, it's crucial to <strong>plan ahead</strong> for elements like <strong>gold foil</strong> or specific dimensions. I created thumbnails with these considerations in mind, which made the final stages smoother. Reusing familiar poses can also help the audience connect with the artwork.</p>

<h2>My General Process</h2>

<ol>

<li><strong>Research</strong>: Get familiar with the characters or subject matter.</li>

<li><strong>Thumbnails</strong>: Explore compositions and storytelling options.</li>

<li><strong>Line Art</strong>: Finalize the drawing.</li>

<li><strong>Flats</strong>: Establish a cohesive color palette.</li>

<li><strong>Shading</strong>: Add depth and finishing touches.</li>

</ol>

<p>Each project may vary, but following these steps helps me create artwork that meets both my standards and the client's needs. Whether it's a new character or a familiar one, this process ensures a <strong>cohesive</strong> and <strong>effective</strong> final piece.</p>
