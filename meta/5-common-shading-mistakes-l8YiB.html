<p>Hey everybody, welcome back. I'm going to be critiquing your spheres to see how you guys did organizing your values while shading. Level 2 is mixed into this, so we're looking at unlimited time studies as well as the 25-minute, 10-minute, and 5-minute ones.</p>

<p>I've skimmed through your work, and overall you guys did fantastic, youâ€™re getting it! There are a few common mistakes I'm seeing, and rather than repeating the same critiques over and over, I'm going to group them together. This should make this more efficient for you all.</p>

<h2>Incorrect Placement of the Terminator</h2>

<p>One of the most common mistakes is the incorrect placement of the <strong>terminator</strong>, the line where the light turns into shadow on the sphere.</p>

<p>I've noticed that sometimes the terminator is placed too far into the light side. For example, the ellipse representing the terminator doesn't cut through the middle of the sphere like an equator. Instead, it's more of a small cap on the top. This can throw off the realism of your shading.</p>

<p>When the light source is far away, like in our reference where the light was five feet away from a two-inch sphere, the light rays are almost parallel. This means the terminator should go right down the middle of the sphere, and the ellipse should be an equator dividing the sphere into equal light and shadow areas.</p>

<p>Here's how I think about it: I start with a ball and imagine parallel light rays coming in. The terminator is right down the middle, so I draw an ellipse that cuts through the sphere's equator. Everything on one side of the terminator is in shadow.</p>

<p>While it's possible for the terminator to not be in the middle of the sphere, this indicates that the light source is very close, and the light rays are diverging significantly. In our reference, the light source was far away, resulting in nearly parallel light rays, so the terminator should be in the middle.</p>

<p>Understanding the relationship between the light source distance and the terminator placement is important. If you place the terminator too far towards the light side, it suggests a lighting scenario that's different from the reference.</p>

<h2>Misrepresentation of the Core Shadow</h2>

<p>Another common issue is misplacing the <strong>core shadow</strong>. The core shadow should be entirely on the shadow side of the terminator, and none of it should be on the light side. If you've placed your terminator correctly, the core shadow will follow naturally.</p>

<p>When drawing the core shadow, think of it as an ellipse that adds thickness to the shadow side of the terminator. It shouldn't overlap into the light side.</p>

<h2>Understanding Ellipses and the Sphere</h2>

<p>Drawing the terminator correctly involves understanding how ellipses slice through the sphere. The ellipse representing the terminator should cut through the middle of the sphere like an equator, dividing it into equal parts of light and shadow when the light source is far away.</p>

<p>This concept is similar to constructing a <strong>Loomis head</strong>. If you can take a sphere and slice off sides or add planes, you can start constructing anything. Once you know how to shade basic forms like spheres, cylinders, and boxes, you can apply these principles to more complex objects.</p>

<p>Even if the sphere isn't perfect, like an egg shape, the same principles apply. The key is understanding how light interacts with the form, and accurately representing that with your shading.</p>

<h2>Building Complexity from Basic Forms</h2>

<p>Once you know how to construct and shade basic forms like spheres, cylinders, and boxes, you can start constructing more complex objects. Understanding how to shade these primitives helps you organize your structure and make everything look very three-dimensional.</p>

<p>After mastering the basics, you can start adding layers to create more organic and realistic forms. While the primary forms are made up of these primitives, the human body, for example, has more complex, organic shapes covered by muscles, fat, and skin with wrinkles. These details add another layer of complexity, but they are built upon the foundation of the basic forms.</p>

<h2>Incorrect Reflected Light Values</h2>

<p>I've noticed that some of you are making the <strong>reflected light</strong> too light, almost matching the values of the halftones on the light side. This can ruin the effect of form and make your sphere look flat or imply a different material, like metal.</p>

<p>The reflected light should never be as light as the halftones on the light side. It should be darker to maintain the separation between the <strong>light and shadow families</strong>. Go back to the values I showed in the initial shading lesson, and compare the values you have for the core shadow, reflected light, cast shadow, and occlusion shadow.</p>

<h2>Uneven Gradations and the Cosine Law</h2>

<p>Some of you have a gradation from the core shadow to the light that is too linear. This doesn't apply the <strong>Lambert's Cosine Law</strong>, which describes how the intensity of light decreases as the surface turns away from the light source.</p>

<p>Most of the transition from shadow to light happens closer to the core shadow, and the transition into light should be faster. If your gradation is too even across the surface, it can make your sphere look flat or less three-dimensional.</p>

<p>Conversely, if the transition is too sudden, it can create the appearance of a sharp edge rather than a smooth, curved surface. The key is to find the balance where the transition is gradual but happens more quickly near the core shadow.</p>

<h2>Incorrect Shape of the Cast Shadow</h2>

<p>Many of you have errors in the <strong>shape of the cast shadow</strong>. When a sphere casts a shadow onto a flat surface, the cast shadow should be a perfect ellipse. However, I see teardrop shapes, elongated pills, and other incorrect shapes.</p>

<p>If the cast shadow is on a curved surface, it will adjust accordingly, but for a flat surface, it should be an ellipse. Pay attention to the symmetry and curvature of your cast shadow to ensure it matches the light source and the form of the sphere.</p>

<h2>Spotty Halftones and Noise</h2>

<p>Some of your spheres have <strong>spotty halftones</strong>, with patches of light and dark in the wrong places. This can make the sphere look dirty or as if it has smudges, rather than a smooth, three-dimensional form.</p>

<p>While it's okay for your shading to have some texture or noise, especially in quick sketches, you need to ensure that the overall values are correct and transitions are smooth. Avoid placing darker halftones near the center light, or creating abrupt changes in value that don't follow the form.</p>

<h2>The Importance of Deliberate Practice</h2>

<p>To improve your shading, identify which of these common mistakes you're making and deliberately practice correcting them. Understanding the science of light and how it interacts with forms is crucial. Once you grasp these concepts, shading becomes more formulaic, and you can focus more on creativity and storytelling in your drawings.</p>

<p>The goal is to create the illusion of form using value transitions and accurate depiction of light and shadow. As you become more comfortable with these elements, you'll spend less time thinking about the technical aspects and more time designing your forms to look even better than the reference.</p>

<p>Alright, let's move on. The next episode is coming out sometime next week. Let's keep shading and get better at this. See ya!</p>
