<h2>The Back View</h2>

<p>When I draw the head from behind, I start by <strong>looking at the symmetry</strong>. I imagine a ball for the skull and notice how the <strong>neck and erector muscles</strong> attach. The erector muscles, or “shrugging muscles,” run in two cables along the back of the neck to <strong>keep the head upright</strong>. They attach high at the base of the skull.</p>

<p>The <strong>ears</strong> often stick out from the sides of the head. From a direct back view, I see the <strong>ears poking out</strong> on either side, with a bit of the face’s silhouette in between. Even though the back of the head is more rounded and lacks the clear “box corners” of the face, I still <strong>use structural thinking</strong> to place the ears and sketch the basic shape of the skull.</p>

<p>I also pay attention to <strong>hairstyle</strong>, which can either hide or reveal parts of the neck and skull. If the hair is full or curly, it helps to <strong>reduce it to simple forms</strong>, either box-like or tube-like, so I can see the main shape before adding any wave or highlight details.</p>

<h2>The Three-Quarter Back View</h2>

<p>When the head rotates to a <strong>three-quarter back view</strong>, I see part of the back and side of the head. The <strong>ear moves closer to the front</strong> of the face as the head turns away. So, I observe how close the ear is to the <strong>silhouette of the jaw</strong> and the sideburn area, then adjust my proportions accordingly.</p>

<h3>Using Box Logic</h3>

<p>I often <strong>apply box logic</strong> to keep the perspective consistent. I imagine corners on the head, even if they’re curved. The corners give me <strong>reference points</strong> to measure angles and proportions. For example:</p>

<p>• If I treat the top of the hair as a box, I can outline a top plane, a side plane, and a back plane.<br />

• Lines connecting these planes will appear to converge slightly, depending on the tilt of the head.<br />

• This creates an easy way to check if the head is angled up, down, or to the side.</p>

<h2>Practical Tips</h2>

<h3>Checking Proportions</h3>

<p>• <strong>Ear Height:</strong> In a three-quarter back view, the ear often appears higher because I’m looking slightly under the form. I’d rather place it a bit too high than too low.<br />

• <strong>Jaw vs. Ear:</strong> The jaw should sit in front of the ear. It’s easy to accidentally shade or place lines that push the jaw behind the ear.<br />

• <strong>Comparisons:</strong> I compare every new line, such as a hairline or eye socket, against the positions of the ears and skull. This helps me keep everything in proportion.</p>

<h3>Emphasizing Structure</h3>

<p>I try to see the fullness of the head <strong>even when I only see partial shapes</strong>. By visualizing all sides of the skull, I can persuade the viewer that the form is <strong>complete and three-dimensional</strong>. Even a slightly rounded head can be drawn with <strong>boxy guidelines</strong> to maintain clarity in how it’s oriented.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p>Using box logic on the back and three-quarter back views helps me see the head as a clear, <strong>architectural structure</strong>. Once I set up those simple building blocks, I add any unique details, like intricate hair shapes or strong jawlines. This process keeps everything in proportion, and makes the anatomy feel solid and convincing from any angle.</p>
