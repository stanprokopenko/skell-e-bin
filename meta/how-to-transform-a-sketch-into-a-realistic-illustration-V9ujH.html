<h2>Bringing in Photo Reference</h2>

<p>I opened up my thumbnail and began to bring in photo reference to tighten up, bringing my drawing to more of a finish. I hired a model, Yoni, whom I use for quite a few of my illustrations. I posed him and lit him like <strong>the Thing</strong>. I also gathered some stock photo reference of rocks. I'm going to use these together, along with the current design, to take this simple, crude silhouette drawing, which is just barely more than a graphic element of my composition, and start engaging in more drawing.</p>

<p>I mentioned over and over again in the thumbnails, **don't worry about drawing, it's a graphic design problem. ** Well, now I'm going to take this graphic design that I'm reasonably happy with, and start worrying about the drawing.</p>

<h2>Adjusting the Canvas and Aligning References</h2>

<p>First, I upped the resolution of my canvas. I went into the canvas settings and lined it up accordingly. I widened my canvas to use as a clipboard, bringing in my reference so I have it on the same screen. You can see it matches pretty well.</p>

<p>I'll start by bringing in the model reference, and maybe adjust the pose a little bit. I actually like some of the dynamics, it might be a little too dynamic in the reference, but that's good. If I'm able to tone down the dynamics of the reference, that is a good place to be. I'm going to use the anatomy and combine it with rock formations to try and get something that looks like a somewhat realistic version of <strong>Ben Grimm</strong>.</p>

<h2>Enhancing the Drawing</h2>

<p>Using my modified round brush, I started painting areas out. I began with the silhouette, carving into it. I mentioned I like the dynamics of the photograph, so I'm trying to get a little bit of that in here. I treat this a lot like I would treat a real painting, start very general and just get the <strong>two-value block-in</strong>. I don't worry about the rock formations yet, I want to get a feeling for the overall figure first.</p>

<p>I really like what's going on with the legs. When I look at him, that knee is coming out, and I can see the way that's wrapping around the thigh. I want to try and get that feeling back into my drawing. His fantastic shorts are coming down a little bit further than his, but I can still use that information. I start to get some of that anatomical contour in there.</p>

<p>It's already starting to get a much better feel to it, much more natural, which, again, is something I'm always looking for. One of the big things I look for when I'm working with my reference is what I call <strong>authenticity</strong>, that believability. What can I take from the reference, and what can I take from my imagination that I can use to enhance my reference?</p>

<h2>Balancing Imagination and Reference</h2>

<p>It's really not just one thing. <strong>Jeff Watts</strong>, my teacher, is fond of saying, **"Drawing is part what you see, part what you know, and part what you'd like to see." ** That's very much how I work in my illustrations. It's always part what I see, the reference, part what I know, my thumbnail, and part what I would like to see, which is using them together to get that desire into fact. My imagination is never perfect. I like the images that I see in my imagination, but they're never completely convincing. So I have to use reference material to get to that level of authenticity, that level of believability, which I strive for in my work.</p>

<p>Now, not everyone works that way, and that's totally fine. That's not a judgment by any stretch of the imagination. I really enjoy people who are greater stylists than I am. It's just not my preferred way of working. I like to take the unbelievable and make it believable.</p>

<h2>Developing the Figure</h2>

<p>Right now, I'm continuing to look at these big shapes, getting the big forms, borrowing what I see in the reference, and enhancing what I already have. I really want to get into those rocks and start making them look like rock because that's one of the fun things about drawing and painting him, making him a rock man. But first, I have to make a figure drawing. Again, right now, it's about that <strong>authenticity</strong>, trying to get it.</p>

<p>I'm making quite a few changes, but he still fills that same compositional space. That's starting to look pretty good, and now I feel comfortable starting to add in, well, maybe not quite yet. Maybe I want to work some of those edges a little bit first. So what I'm going to do is consider this a <strong>halftone</strong>. I'm just going to roll that form a little bit more.</p>

<p>I don't want to get carried away with that because he is made out of rock, so there aren't a lot of soft forms like there would be on a realistic human body, not that the <strong>ever-loving blue-eyed Thing</strong> isn't a human. He certainly is probably more human than most of us, and he definitely has that rocky fa√ßade.</p>

<h2>Artistic Inspirations</h2>

<p>If anyone is amazed that I go through all this trouble before even getting to the final painting, they should really look into <strong>Rockwell's</strong> approach. That guy, man, he would do paintings that most people would consider finished paintings, and he would go, "No, that's just a comp." So I try to duplicate his process as much as I can.</p>

<p>Then I also try to bring in elements that I think, arrogantly, I try to bring in ideas that I think he maybe wasn't super good at. Like, if I can bring in the dynamics and energy of a <strong>Frazetta</strong> painting but combine it with the academic dedication to excellence that <strong>Rockwell</strong> had, well, that's what I want. That's what I'm after. I mean, it's ridiculous, it's a ridiculous thing to go for. But what else am I going to do? That's what I try. That's what I'm striving for, taking the best characteristics of all my favorite artists and trying to bring myself to that level.</p>

<h2>Sculpting the Rock Formations</h2>

<p>So that's looking pretty good. I like that. It's got a good feel. I mean, it feels like the Thing, but it is fleshed out. We can go back and forth here with, you know, that's what it looked like, and that's what it looks like now. The graphic shape, the silhouette, other than maybe that far side arm, hasn't changed hardly at all. But I have brought some character to it. I've brought some energy to it.</p>

<p>Now I'm going to come in and start sculpting some of those rocks, because I want to look at some of that anatomy in the rib cage. Let's see if I can steal some of that for some of the crags. I'll take a bunch of time trying to get these crags in here, and I probably won't even end up making them look like that in the final painting. But it's nice, as I'm going through the final oil painting. If things start going, a little rocky, then I'll have something to go back to.</p>

<p>I like to keep that stuff kind of freeform, to a certain degree. I don't want to get in there to render rocks, that doesn't interest me. So what I'll do is just kind of have this as a guide, so that if I end up doing something in the final painting that I don't like, then I'll have this to go back to. I'm trying to go along with the anatomy that is there as much as possible.</p>

<h2>Adding Bevels and Facets</h2>

<p>Now I've got these rocks kind of roughly blocked in there. Now I'm going to come in and get a lighter value. I'll come in, put a little bevel. So right next to where I put a little crack, if our light is coming down from the right, then there should be a little bevel under each of those little cracks and crevices.</p>

<p>I use the sides of the brush a little bit so we can do a little bit more <strong>planar painting</strong>. I lowered the opacity and raised the size of the brush, so I can come in and add some good planes to the rocks. Basically, I'm creating little <strong>facets</strong> on those rocks. I'm doing a little heavier with the dark facets as I move away from the light source, a little heavier on the light facets as I move up to the light source.</p>

<p>You'll see me just periodically change up a color or a value, and that's to add some randomization, just to add some texture. If I'm going to have to hand-paint it in the final painting, I like to do that as much as I can in this phase as well. I don't really like anything that's completely uniform because I don't think it's realistic. <strong>Everything has slight value and color fluctuations</strong>, and so to create that same effect, I'll just randomly take little color selections.</p>

<h2>Creating Randomness and Texture</h2>

<p>Because of the way I've layered things up, what happens is you get some areas of his rock that are going to rub on things more often and are going to be exposed to sun more often. So, what I do is I try to randomize. I'll use slightly different color selections, slightly different opacities, all these things just to create randomness or <strong>broken color</strong>, or whatever.</p>

<p>One of my favorite painters, <strong>Morgan Weistling</strong>, doesn't like mixing up a big pile of paint like some artists will recommend you do because if you're not careful, you can get lazy. It can create this uniformity in your paintings. I try to get a lot of these rocky crags to work with the anatomy. So if there's a kneecap down here, wrapping around the kneecap. I know there's a tendon coming in there, or the shin. I try to get this stuff to work in conjunction with real anatomy as much as I can.</p>

<p>Sometimes it's just, again, randomization. It's just, I think I need a little shape there. That's really starting to get somewhere. Because at first, when you look at it, it's like hair, right? Same thing with hair, which I still don't like to paint. It's like you look at it, and at first, it just seems so random. But then you start doing a little bit more of a deep dive, and you're like, <strong>"Oh, it's really not."</strong> There's a lot of science and technique to it. </p>

<h2>Bringing It All Together</h2>

<p>I really wouldn't say I enjoy rendering anything. I think my work can be deceptively tight. It's not really as tight as people think it is. When you get right up on it, like, you get up on this stuff, it's just a bunch of little squiggles and bobs. And my finished oil paintings really are not any different. They're also mostly just a bunch of little squiggles and tiles and bobs and oops. When it comes all together, hopefully, if I do it right, it comes all together, and looks like what it's supposed to look like.</p>

<p>So I think I'm going to call that done. I'm pretty happy with that. I mean, there's still lots of little things that we could get into, like fingers and toes, but that's really not a lot of fun to watch. I think that gets the point across. We can start to really see how we have taken that basic shape. I mean, look at how much of that silhouette and that shape, that <strong>compositional element</strong>, that <strong>design element</strong>, look at how much of that has remained. But we've rendered it out, and created something more realistic.</p>

<p>Now I have a good guide for my oil painting, and I'll probably change things even more in the final painting. But that has a good feel to me, and that's what I'm after. It's like I want that <strong>big picture</strong>, that <strong>good feel</strong>. The details I'm still not too concerned about, I can come up with those as long as the big picture is working.</p>

<p>But right now, if I squint at that, it feels pretty realistic. It feels authentic to me. It feels like a man made of rock, holding up a spaceship. It's got a nice expression, it's got a nice body language. It just feels really good to me. What I would do is just continue to go around the whole thing. However long that took, an hour, hour and a half, whatever it was, I would now go in and do that to each one. So another hour, another hour, you know, so say another four to five hours on that.</p>

<h2>Time Investment and Workflow</h2>

<p>Like I said, it takes me usually about <strong>four to eight hours</strong> to do one of these. So I'd spend most of a day doing this once I've come up with my thumbnail, and then I'm ready to get into my final painting, which will take me four or five days. So I'm talking about a good solid week's worth of work to do a cover if I'm really cranking and working every day for eight hours.</p>

<p>I hope that kind of helped illuminate what my process is and how I go about things. We're just trying to baby-step you through the whole process, take you through those thumbnails and how I come up with ideas and what I'm thinking about while I'm doing that. It really is a <strong>design or composition problem</strong>. Then when I start getting into drawing, that's when I start bringing in my photo reference to start really trying to nail that down and make it as authentic as I possibly can, answering any questions I might have.</p>

<p>And now it's just a matter of going in and painting it in oils.</p>

<p><strong>Let's go!</strong></p>
