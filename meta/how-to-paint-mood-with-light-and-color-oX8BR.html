<p>I want to talk about putting all of this into practice in a piece of concept design. In this article, I'll show my process for applying lighting and color to a simple line drawing and explore how different lighting scenarios can change the mood and focal points in a concept design.</p>

<p>I've drawn a very simple geometric composition of a mountain scape with three layers:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Foreground:</strong> A hill with a little character walking along a path.</li>

<li><strong>Midground:</strong> A castle-like structure.</li>

<li><strong>Background:</strong> Mountains in the distance.</li>

</ul>

<p>This setup allows us to have depth and layering compositionally. I've split this into four blocks: the sky, the mountains, the midground, and the foreground.</p>

<h2>Starting with Ambient Light</h2>

<p>When I paint, I like to start by thinking about <strong>ambient light</strong>. Let's say it's a bluish, cloudy daylight coming from everywhere. I start very rough and then refine a little more.</p>

<p>I can take my line art and hide it. The goal for me is to not have the line art if I want to have really believable lighting and color, because there's no line art in real life.</p>

<h3>Splitting Layers and Ambient Occlusion</h3>

<p>I took this and decided to split it into distinct layers. I have multiple layers here, and I can lock them so I can paint. I just did a nice sharp selection set in this sloppy version where it's just the impression.</p>

<p>Now, I don't need to make fully refined art here. I'm exploring the lighting, so they can stay very loose sketches. Not everything is perfectly refined.</p>

<p>Then, I take those layers and make an <strong>ambient occlusion pass</strong>. I'm thinking about the soft shadows. I've painted in value into each of those layers where you can see the soft light. It's like a gray day.</p>

<p>I'm also not thinking about the local color of the objects. In this case, I'm just making everything gray so that this is <strong>light-centric</strong>, a light-centric focus.</p>

<p>Now I have all the layers split into each of these blocks of the composition with some soft light.</p>

<h3>Applying Local Colors</h3>

<p>Then I think about the <strong>local color</strong>. In the same kind of generic bluish-gray light, I can adjust my colors slightly to give the idea of grass, the stone of the walls, and different material on the top. Maybe there's some snow in those mountains. I'm using this as a starting place.</p>

<p>I can still see depth and the shape and form. The ambient occlusion helps me see the form. The distinct edging allows me to see the shapes of each of these objects.</p>

<h2>Exploring Different Lighting Scenarios</h2>

<p>Now, I start thinking about how I can utilize the light. By default, I'm already thinking depth, and I have a little bit of fog in this to separate the layers. The distance, what's in the foreground has the <strong>darkest darks</strong>, the midground is a little bit less, and then into the background, each layer progressively gets a little bit lighter due to <strong>atmospheric perspective</strong>.</p>

<h3>Misty Morning</h3>

<p>The first thing I want to do is a really <strong>misty morning</strong> because we're already in that gray zone.</p>

<ul>

<li>I changed the sky from just a flat color to give it a more gray look and painted in some soft cloud-like structures.</li>

<li>I added a layer in <strong>linear dodge add</strong> mode and painted in some soft extra layering like there's mist down in the valley.</li>

<li>I played with some contrast in the foreground hill to make it even darker.</li>

<li>I did a hue saturation level that took some of the saturation out of the color to make it look far more muted and misty.</li>

<li>I added another fog layer with floating misty layers of clouds, hovering between the castle and the mountain behind it.</li>

</ul>

<p>Those little lights I added to the castle add some color contrast to draw the eye to it as a focal point. The focal point of this shot could be the sky, the castle, or the character. In this case, I think it's really the castle.</p>

<h3>Dense Fog</h3>

<p>I wanted another version, misty but with <strong>full fog</strong>. Not high clouds with low mist, but something even <strong>denser</strong>.</p>

<ul>

<li>I adjusted the background colors and made it brighter, giving even more depth and separation.</li>

<li>I made the sky just a flat color, so the whole thing is filled with mist in the air.</li>

<li>I made a copy of the background mountain and blurred it slightly by a few pixels. This blur pushes that mountain as if there's particulate in the air diffusing it.</li>

<li>I added more fog and did the same for the midground mountains, they are slightly out of focus as well.</li>

<li>I put more fog in between layers and made a fog layer that's really strong, painting color over top to create patchy fog rolling in.</li>

<li>I added little window lights back in and blurred them to give the effect that they are softly affecting the atmosphere.</li>

</ul>

<p>Now the focal point of this shot is definitely the <strong>character</strong>, because the highest contrast is right there on the character looking over this misty scene.</p>

<h3>High Key Morning Light</h3>

<p>What if I want to do a <strong>morning shot</strong>? Let's do something that is <strong>high key</strong>, lots of bright light, a happy morning.</p>

<ul>

<li>I found a piece of reference of a morning sunrise and used that.</li>

<li>I liked how the sunlight diffused through the air.</li>

<li>I painted the sky with some of the colors from the photograph of a morning sky, using blues and some oranges and yellows.</li>

<li>I painted each layer with the idea of light coming from screen left, painting bright light on one side and dark on the other to give good form to the mountains.</li>

<li>The light is very soft, so I don't have hard shadows but soft shadows.</li>

<li>I'm also wrapping that light around the surfaces and changing my colors intentionally to show how the light would bend around the objects.</li>

<li>I have a limited palette of very soft pastel colors.</li>

<li>I added a layer of glow over top that supports the idea of a very high key, soft, beautiful morning light.</li>

</ul>

<p>This is a different look.</p>

<h3>Midday with Pool of Light</h3>

<p>What if I want a look where not everything is being hit by the sun? I still want a <strong>midday shot</strong>, but I want this to have a <strong>pool of light</strong>.</p>

<ul>

<li>Instead of having everything being lit, I want a little bit of clouds to justify a beam of light coming onto the castle.</li>

<li>I have this midday version and painted some clouds in the sky.</li>

<li>I added sunlight onto the castle but didn't let the sunlight hit the back mountains or the foreground character, creating a very strong focal point.</li>

<li>I changed colors slightly so that it falls off, like one little dot of light.</li>

<li>I added some layers of fog to give extra separation and help the character stand out.</li>

<li>I'm playing with a very saturated color palette with <strong>cyans</strong> in my fog to complement the warm yellow-greens.</li>

<li>In the foreground, I painted a little bit of light as if light is bouncing off the hill towards the character.</li>

<li>I added a <strong>bloom layer</strong> over top that lets the light glow through atmosphere and fog into the camera.</li>

</ul>

<p>This is a different type of happy than our high key sunrise, with a different level of contrast.</p>

<h3>Midday Sun with Bounce Light</h3>

<p>Now, what if I want <strong>midday sun</strong>?</p>

<ul>

<li>I found a reference image where the sun is coming from screen right.</li>

<li>I have a fog layer that helps give a little separation.</li>

<li>I put an extra <strong>bounce light</strong> - light that is coming in and bouncing off the character's red cloak back onto the rocks, and light bouncing from the rocks onto themselves.</li>

<li>I didn't let the sunlight go all the way down because I wanted there to be a right-screen-centric focus.</li>

<li>I added a little <strong>cyan highlight</strong> from the left to help see the roundness of the tops of the roofs.</li>

<li>I added some glow to the sky, as if the sun is up there shining down, and there's a little bit of haze that takes some of the crunchiness of the contrast out and softens the whole image.</li>

</ul>

<p>There's a different focus and it follows the same composition.</p>

<h3>Sunset</h3>

<p>I did another sunset, and you can see a little bit more of my process.</p>

<ul>

<li>I adjusted the layers to turn the whole thing a little more purple.</li>

<li>I have a sun that I placed right here and added some glow to it.</li>

<li>I added glow to the overall scene, so this is right as the sun is setting.</li>

<li>I have some extra <strong>specular highlights</strong>, so I see sun highlights on the rocks and on the edge of the character, and little highlights on the castle.</li>

<li>I have a paint layer over top to give more complexity to the clouds.</li>

<li>I added the window lights being on to make this look like a high-contrast sunset.</li>

</ul>

<p>This is still a rough painting and would need cleanup to turn into a final illustration, but it gives me an idea of what this scene could look like if the sun were low in the sky.</p>

<h3>Nighttime Scene</h3>

<p>Finally, I wanted it to be <strong>nighttime</strong>.</p>

<ul>

<li>I started by darkening the whole image and painted some really dark clouds into it.</li>

<li>I added low clouds and some fog to split the layers.</li>

<li>I added more fog to really separate the castle from the background, and more to separate the foreground character from the castle.</li>

<li>I added a <strong>chunky fog</strong> layer with a brush that has more grit to it.</li>

<li>I turned the window lights on and added glow from those windows.</li>

<li>I added <strong>bounce light</strong> coming from those lights.</li>

<li>The camera is exposed for night, so those windows' light will spread further.</li>

<li>On the character, I thought it'd be great if the staff has some magic in it, drawing more attention to the character.</li>

<li>I added some glow, a little more glow of that light onto the surrounding set, making the character definitely the focal point.</li>

<li>I added some <strong>sparkle layers</strong> onto the staff.</li>

<li>Then, I put a moon in the sky.</li>

<li>I added a warm glow on top of the moon.</li>

<li>Even though most people think of moonlight as blue, actual moonlight is very yellow. There's a thing called the <strong>Purkinje effect</strong> that affects your perception, at night, you can't see reds as much as blues and greens.</li>

<li>I painted in a little bit of warmth onto the clouds to rim light them.</li>

<li>I added a layer of a few stars.</li>

<li>I added direct <strong>moonlight</strong>, forming a rim on the top of the towers and edges of the mountains, helping to see the shape and form.</li>

<li>I did a little paint touch-up, adding more detail into the clouds.</li>

<li>I added a little bit more fog to soften the night and more glow into the fog.</li>

</ul>

<p>This gives me my final look.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p>Let's look at all of these again. You can see I don't need the line art to make this work. These should all work:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Night</strong></li>

<li><strong>Sunset</strong></li>

<li><strong>Midday</strong></li>

<li><strong>Midday with a pool of light</strong></li>

<li><strong>Very high key morning soft pastel</strong></li>

<li><strong>Super thick mist</strong></li>

<li><strong>Very thin mist</strong></li>

<li><strong>Plain local color of the objects</strong></li>

</ul>

<p>This is my process for the way I think about putting lighting and color into a simple line drawing and really exploring what the light and color can do.</p>
