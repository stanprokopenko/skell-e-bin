<p>Hi, welcome to Gesture Drawing. My name is Michael Hampton. In this series of videos, I'll be breaking down what I find to be an incredibly nebulous and ambiguous concept: <strong>gesture</strong>.</p>

<p>Gesture is confusing because there's multiple ways people discuss it. Often, we're under some kind of time pressure or there's an expectation to do these things quickly. At the very worst, this can turn into some kind of excited flailing of line and charcoal or graphite. The saving grace, if you ever find yourself a little confused or lost, is to remember it's <strong>only for you</strong>. It's just the foundation of the drawing from which you will build on top.</p>

<h2>The Three Big Questions in Gesture Drawing</h2>

<p>To make sense of gesture, I like to break this big category into three different pieces:</p>

<ol>

<li><strong>Why am I doing it?</strong> Or, why are others doing it? Why does that person's gesture look like that?</li>

<li><strong>What am I doing it about?</strong> For our discussion relative to figures, I'm going to focus on the eight parts of the body.</li>

<li><strong>How am I going to achieve the type of look I want?</strong></li>

</ol>

<p>These are the big three questions I consider in any visual pursuit. There's no right way, there's just your way or how you want to organize your thoughts.</p>

<h2>Focusing on the "Why"</h2>

<p>Let's start with <strong>why</strong> I would make a gesture drawing.</p>

<h3>Initial Idea and Story in Gesture Drawing</h3>

<p>I try to give myself four things to think about, but we're mostly going to focus on this first one for now. The first, and sometimes hardest, one to answer is <strong>whatever your initial idea is</strong>. If it's more specific to the figure, we might even say that this is some kind of <strong>story concern about your figure</strong>.</p>

<p>The reason this part is both the hardest and the most important is because it's highly subjective, and I can't answer this part for you. Having an idea about what you see and how you want to communicate that to an audience, that's all you. In some sense, that's very much something you could maybe learn through history and appreciate art museums to develop, but it still has to be generated on your side.</p>

<p>Drawing and gesture in this sense is very much a <strong>communicative act</strong>. We're focused on saying something to somebody else, so <strong>this needs to be clear first</strong>.</p>

<h3>Abstraction and Its Importance</h3>

<p>Generating an idea is most easily attained in terms of <strong>abstraction</strong>. Abstraction means to withdraw or remove what's the essence of a subject and put it into its simplest terms. In this case, that could be lines like a <strong>straight</strong>, a <strong>C</strong>, an <strong>S</strong>, or maybe your basic shapes: a <strong>sphere</strong>, a <strong>box</strong>, a <strong>cone</strong>.</p>

<p>In gesture drawing, we're not copying the thing, we're <strong>generating an idea about it</strong>. These are really confusing concepts. They're always the questions that I get about gesture. People often ask, "Which part of the body is that?" Which side is it? Is that the contour of the back? It's only because of getting those questions for years, that I've started to move toward this type of description to sensitize you.</p>

<h2>Examples from Art History</h2>

<p>I want to direct your attention to people who have helped me come to this understanding, people you can also reference. You'll start to see the great degree of similarity that exists in the way many artists define an idea.</p>

<h3>The Renaissance and the Vitruvian Man</h3>

<p>My favorite thing in art is always seeing the high against the low. An example of a high kind of framing of an idea is the <strong>Renaissance</strong>. We can understand the Renaissance in the form of one image: the <strong>Vitruvian Man</strong>.</p>

<p>You've all seen this, I hope. It's a figure suspended between a square and a circle. What does this mean? Well, this exercise was called <strong>squaring the circle</strong>. Every artist was trying to make the figure dissolve into this harmonious proportion, somewhere between a box and a sphere.</p>

<p>Why? The <strong>sphere</strong> symbolically represented the idea of the <strong>divine</strong>, and the <strong>box</strong> represented the idea of the <strong>terrestrial</strong> or the earthly plane. The figure was meant to be some kind of synthesis, an aesthetic bridge that connected the divine and the terrestrial.</p>

<p>The goal of the Renaissance was to give rebirth to principles of antiquity that had been lost, such as <strong>harmony</strong>, and connections between the divine and the terrestrial. This illustration embodies those concepts, distilling the idea into its most simplest terms.</p>

<h3>Andrew Loomis and the Line of Beauty</h3>

<p>Another example is from <strong>Andrew Loomis</strong> , whose books are very popular. Look at how abstract his description of line is. He has seven steps, it's very specific, organized, and intentional. Number one is something highly subjective, <strong>conveying beauty</strong>.</p>

<p>For him, the idea of <strong>rhythm</strong> is important. This is something I hear talked about all the time in gesture. He discusses basic lines of rhythm and beauty. That's where I would identify his understanding of gesture.</p>

<h3>William Hogarth's Serpentine Lines</h3>

<p>Loomis references <strong>William Hogarth</strong>, a British artist who had lots of ideas about a <strong>line of beauty</strong>. Hogarth would often hide this line in his images, like on his palette or within different aspects of the composition, because gesturally, that's building his concept forward.</p>

<p>He described <strong>serpentine lines</strong>, talking about them with great intention. They move the eye and create a pregnant moment, which is sometimes really useful for thinking of figures where we're trying to create anticipation.</p>

<h3>Nathan Cabot Hale's Curved Lines</h3>

<p>Other books, like <strong>Nathan Cabot Hale's "Abstraction in Art and Nature"</strong>, talk about line in a similar way. He describes the curved line as <strong>delightful</strong> or <strong>pleasurable</strong>. There's this connection between these authors about line and its pleasurable qualities to the eye.</p>

<h3>Glenn Vilppu's Asymmetrical Curves</h3>

<p>My teacher, <strong>Glenn Vilppu</strong>, used a very similar aesthetic. You can see a curve and the asymmetrical positioning of curves to develop a rhythmic quality of movement. I always think of Vilppu's work as being very suited to the time that he was teaching to animators when there was a lot of work being done traditionally.</p>

<h3>Disney's Appeal and Fluid Forms</h3>

<p>If you read <strong>"The Illusion of Life"</strong>, which is a big Disney guide on the development of their aesthetic, on page 68 it gives you <strong>appeal</strong>. Again, another idea or intention of what is beautiful, what is appealing. Artists in the Renaissance and Hogarth were doing similar things, creating fluid forms that have an active potential.</p>

<h3>Michelangelo's Active and Passive Anatomy</h3>

<p>We can look at <strong>Michelangelo's</strong> works and see similar principles. This is my favorite drawing by Michelangelo. He's organizing an idea about <strong>active and passive anatomy</strong> or the design of positioning of active and passive groups. It's highly focused but also picks up on that quality of motion.</p>

<p>Even in drawings where there's no completed shapes, he's describing movement. He's organizing the body on abstracted rhythms that give some kind of pleasurable or delightful movement-based experience.</p>

<h2>Modern Applications of Gesture</h2>

<p>I see most people working with gesture today doing this to some extent.</p>

<h3>The Force Books</h3>

<p>For example, the great <strong>Force books</strong> focus on asymmetry. The basic rhythm movements participate in the same idea. Maybe they just have a greater sense of shape and caricature, but what holds them together is that same principle.</p>

<h3>James McMullan's High Focus Drawing</h3>

<p>When I was in school, we worked out of <strong>James McMullan's "High Focus Drawing"</strong> quite a bit. Is there any difference? Not really. He's still doing the same kind of high-focused arrangements of offset asymmetrical groups and lines.</p>

<h3>Will Eisner's Non-Verbal Communication</h3>

<p>I like to include <strong>Will Eisner</strong> because his gestures are awesome for a different reason. His idea ranges or starts to move from rhythm and movement to capturing large non-verbal qualities of what the body can say. That's why they pair so well with his comic work.</p>

<h3>Character Archetypes and Shape Language</h3>

<p>One way to think about gesture is by looking at the early Disney lineup of characters and archetypes. When I see character lineups or character designs like this, I think of this as gesture in a way, or it's part of the <strong>why</strong>. There's an immediate pickup of understanding what's going on at the level of abstraction.</p>

<h4>The Hero</h4>

<p>The <strong>hero</strong> is always dissolved into some kind of <strong>square</strong> form. The average hero might be like a seven and a half head square. An idealized hero, like a Marvel hero, just gets bigger and wider. That makes sense because, if we remain the same proportion, Captain America is, for all intents and purposes, better than us, bigger than us. That's his origin story.</p>

<h4>The Heroine</h4>

<p>Why are heroes primarily motivated by heroines in stories? The <strong>heroine</strong> is often represented with <strong>curves</strong>. There's a connection back to the idea of the line of beauty, rhythm, and asymmetry. In storytelling, this plays into the hero's journey and archetypes.</p>

<h4>The Brute</h4>

<p>Why is there always a <strong>brute</strong> that's encountered that looks like this? The brute is a <strong>top-heavy shape</strong>, where all the mass of the shape has been dissolved into an upper-heavy form. This feels violent or threatening because we expect gravity to be working, and when mass is higher, it feels more dangerous.</p>

<h4>The Sidekick</h4>

<p>Conversely, a <strong>sidekick</strong> character might have a <strong>lower center of gravity</strong>. The mass gets lower, and it works the same for opposite reasons. This lower weight feels depressed or weaker, while the higher mass feels more active and threatening.</p>

<h4>The Anemic Character</h4>

<p>Another character would be the <strong>anemic archetype</strong>, where we have this narrow and thinned body. Anything that feels thinner or more brittle has less structure perhaps.</p>

<h4>The Villain</h4>

<p>The <strong>villain</strong> is always represented with something <strong>angular and sharp</strong>. We have a predatory response to this shape of some kind. Like, don't go in the ocean because of sharks, we know that. They're just giant triangles with mouths, and they are looking to eat you.</p>

<h3>Combining Shapes for Character Design</h3>

<p>You can blend these shapes. What's really popular today? Today it's popular to take the hero and mix it with the villain, and then we get <strong>Kratos</strong> or <strong>Batman</strong>, the villainous hero or the anti-hero. Or we mix the hero with the brute, and then we get <strong>Shrek</strong> - the hero that externalizes his inner conflict. Mixing the hero with the anemic archetype might give us <strong>Neo</strong> from The Matrix, the weak nerd that becomes the savior at the end of the movie.</p>

<p>This reads because of <strong>shape</strong>. It's different from the rhythm I showed you earlier, but it's another way of trying to draw your attention to the idea part of this. The wrangling of your intention of what you want to say into an abbreviated or abstracted language, that is gesture.</p>

<p>Gesture is connecting with your idea and organizing your thoughts with your simplest means: <strong>straight</strong>, <strong>curve</strong>, <strong>S</strong>, <strong>sphere</strong>, <strong>box</strong>, <strong>triangle</strong>, and trying to make those speak to what your interests are.</p>

<h2>Storytelling and Body Language in Figure Drawing</h2>

<p>Now we can start to narrow into our figures. We started really broad, and now we're going to start to slowly focus into the specific subject, which is the figure.</p>

<h3>Non-Verbal Communication</h3>

<p>What does it mean to have a story, as far as the figure? Story to me might be whatever the <strong>non-verbal communication</strong> of the body is. What is body language saying? It could be what your mood is or what your character's mood is.</p>

<p>These can be exaggerated, maybe you like to really push the theatricality of story, which might be appropriate to animation. Or maybe you want the opposite, maybe you're working with more subtlety in storytelling.</p>

<p>An example would be how you recognize your best friend or your loved one fifty feet away. Even if you strip all detail, you might think you see someone from far away. We all have a natural way that we hold our weight, tilt our shoulders, move. Those subtleties or those subtle cues are also a part of non-verbal communication.</p>

<h3>The Value of Paring Down the Figure</h3>

<p>This is one of the most important reasons that I really <strong>pare my figure down</strong> at the gesture stage. If we do it in a one or two-minute window, we're only looking for the <strong>biggest ideas</strong>, the most important takeaways.</p>

<h3>Cafe Sketching and Capturing Gestures</h3>

<p>This is the value I see in café sketching. You're encountering this very non-specific, anything-can-happen group of people, and you're there as a reporter in your sketchbook. You're trying to take what you see from different people, record it, make associations to moods or feelings or some kind of psychology, and capture that in your sketchbook to maybe use it for later.</p>

<h3>Using Pose to Convey Character</h3>

<p>We can connect these ideas back to our character shapes. Here's my hero in terms of the shape, that's the idea, the big immediate read, but it doesn't have a story, it doesn't have a pose. So maybe I make the character, maybe we give it <strong>contrapposto</strong>, just the off-balance position of shoulder and hip. Maybe that reads as confident, nonchalant. Maybe this is the beginning of the hero's journey, and he's kind of arrogant. Those would be the non-verbal aspects that I'm trying to describe to you.</p>

<h2>Hands as a Tool for Expression</h2>

<p>A specific example to show how you can think differently about not capturing contour at the very beginning but instead look for these things is <strong>hands</strong>. Your hands do something that punctuates what you're saying. A lot of books and articles talk about ten basic ways that we use our hands.</p>

<h3>Zones of Gesture with Hands</h3>

<p>Hands are generally used in one of a couple areas. We're mostly comfortable seeing people use their hands <strong>here</strong>, between the collarbones and the waist. This would be a comfortable way to add and punctuate the message of your body or your speech.</p>

<p>Imagine somebody talking with their hands <strong>here</strong>, crossed tightly under the armpit. We could have a stiff presentation. Then there's the hyper-exaggerated use of the hands, which would be the inclusion of their use <strong>above the head</strong>. We don't see this as often. Think of this like a volume knob.</p>

<p>How often do you see people talking daily with their hands above their head? You would be alarmed. There's an elevation to the way that the message is read.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p>I'm giving you all these examples so you can know what my intention is, what it is that I'm looking for, and the reasons that I'm paring my approach down. When I'm drawing, I'm drawing these things and not the outside. It's not the neck, it's not the back, it's not the shoulder, it's <strong>an idea about what I see</strong>.</p>

<p>It's impossible to draw what you see. It just is. When you finish a drawing, it's never going to be the thing you're drawing. It will always be a drawing, no matter what you do.</p>

<p>Think about the mechanics of drawing something. You can't even look at both simultaneously. You're either looking at the thing or looking at your paper. In between, as you look up or as you look down, there's an absence, and that absence is always filled in with the way you remember it, the idea you have about it, what you bring to it, what you want to say.</p>
