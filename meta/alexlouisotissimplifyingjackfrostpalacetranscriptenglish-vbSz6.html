<p>Drawing complex scenes like Jack Frost's Palace can be challenging. <strong>How do you get good at drawing something this complex?</strong> You learn to think of the picture in several separate ways.</p>

<h2>Think of the Picture in Separate Ways</h2>

<ul>

<li><strong>Composition</strong></li>

<li><strong>Color</strong>, <strong>line</strong>, and <strong>shape</strong></li>

<li>As a <strong>graphic story device</strong></li>

<li>The <strong>subject matter</strong></li>

</ul>

<p>But there's another hidden side to this.</p>

<h2>Understanding Three-Dimensional Structures</h2>

<p>The artist thinks of the room as <strong>round</strong>, and we're <strong>inside</strong> it. They simplify the stairway's big structure before adding details like the steps. The basic lesson is to <strong>boil things down to the simplest forms possible</strong>.</p>

<p>This setting is particularly challenging because we're inside the structure. We'll explore the difference between <strong>exteriors and interiors</strong> in another lesson.</p>

<p>Even if the artist didn't sketch an analysis, they were aware of the <strong>three-dimensional structures</strong>: macro, mid-level, and micro.</p>

<h2>Observations on Perspective and Aesthetics</h2>

<p>Look at how the pillars in the back get thinner farther away and crowd together on the left. The spaces between them get thinner. In reality, these far corner pillars would compress much more, but <strong>so what? It looks good!</strong></p>

<p>As you study, you'll notice things like that. As you work, you'll choose between <strong>technical truth</strong> and <strong>aesthetics</strong>.</p>

<h2>Seeing Like a Cinematographer</h2>

<p>By studying <strong>lenses</strong> and <strong>proximity</strong>, you'll recognize that this is a <strong>wide-angle lens</strong>. You'll see like a cinematographer and notice big three-dimensional structures. If we were outside the structure, the big cylinder would look different. But since the camera is inside, you need to <strong>think in big cylinders</strong>.</p>

<h2>The Big Simple Lesson</h2>

<p>The big simple lesson here is to <strong>look for big simple things</strong>. Also, work in <strong>stages</strong>. <strong>Rough in</strong> the whole image loosely with pencil, placing positions before detailing when working on something this complex.</p>

<p>Sometimes, you might choose to go straight for it, <strong>fearless</strong>, <strong>spontaneous</strong>, <strong>planned</strong>, or <strong>meticulous</strong>. We'll deal with that in our next set of lessons. For now, focus on setting your sight on <strong>big simple forms</strong>.</p>
