<h2>Concept and Inspiration</h2>

<p>When Marvel asked me to create a variant cover for <strong>Fantastic Four #44</strong>, I was thrilled. With no specific directions, I had free rein to bring my vision to life. I wanted to highlight the <strong>teamwork and family aspect</strong> of the Fantastic Four. My idea was to show them <strong>all working together on a common task</strong>.</p>

<p>I thought about a retro 1950s flying saucer or hovercraft that <strong>Mr. Fantastic</strong> was building or repairing. Each member would contribute using their unique abilities and personalities.</p>

<h3>Emphasizing Teamwork and Avoiding Stereotypes</h3>

<p>I aimed to avoid gender stereotypes. Traditionally, <strong>Sue Storm</strong> might have been shown bringing refreshments. Instead, I had <strong>Johnny Storm</strong> (<strong>Human Torch</strong>) <strong>bringing hot drinks</strong>, using his flame powers to keep them warm. <strong>Sue</strong> is <strong>actively contributing</strong> by levitating the toolbox with her InvisiDiscs, assisting <strong>Mr. Fantastic</strong> as he works on the undercarriage. <strong>Ben Grimm</strong> (<strong>The Thing</strong>) is <strong>holding up the spaceship</strong>, using his immense strength.</p>

<p>My wife, who is also an artist, helped me ensure that <strong>Sue</strong> was portrayed fairly and <strong>participating on equal footing</strong>. I wanted to modernize the classic family dynamic while staying true to its roots.</p>

<h2>Composition and Design Choices</h2>

<h3>Incorporating the Fantastic Four Logo</h3>

<p>I wanted to infuse the piece with a <strong>Norman Rockwell vibe</strong>. Instead of using Rockwell's signature circular motif with stripes, which might clutter the image, I integrated the <strong>Fantastic Four logo</strong> into the composition. The circular element with two lines became part of the background, adding depth and tying everything together.</p>

<h3>Focusing on Textures and Materials</h3>

<p>One of my favorite aspects of painting is capturing different <strong>textures</strong>. I paid special attention to:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Ben Grimm's rocky exterior</strong></li>

<li>The <strong>shiny metal</strong> of the spaceship</li>

<li>The <strong>leather and spandex</strong> of the costumes</li>

<li>The <strong>rusty toolbox</strong> and <strong>ceramic cups</strong></li>

</ul>

<p>Rendering each material differently helps bring the image to life. It prevents everything from looking like it's made of the same substance and adds authenticity.</p>

<h2>Bringing Characters to Life</h2>

<h3>Capturing Personalities</h3>

<p><strong>Ben Grimm</strong> is one of my favorite characters to paint. I enjoy the challenge of revealing his <strong>soul and heart</strong> beneath the rocky exterior. He's the heart of the Fantastic Four, and I wanted that to come through.</p>

<p>I also included subtle storytelling elements, like <strong>Mr. Fantastic's old, beat-up toolbox</strong>. To me, maybe it's his dad's toolbox, showing his sentimental side despite his intellectual demeanor.</p>

<h3>Seeking Authenticity</h3>

<p>I believe that no detail is unimportant. Even the <strong>steam coming off the hot drinks</strong> adds to the authenticity. I often shoot my own reference photos, which helps capture nuances I might not imagine on my own.</p>

<h2>Collaborating and Seeking Feedback</h2>

<p>I value <strong>input from others</strong> to enhance my work. My wife offered invaluable insights, especially regarding <strong>Sue Storm's portrayal</strong>. She helped me avoid unintentional biases and ensure that <strong>Sue</strong> was neither overshadowed nor unnecessarily sexualized.</p>

<p>I also consult with artist friends and mentors whenever possible. They provide unique perspectives that enrich the piece.</p>

<h2>Reflecting on the Process</h2>

<p>This cover allowed me to <strong>stretch my storytelling muscles</strong>. While it might not be my favorite piece technically, I'm proud of the <strong>story it tells and the emotions it conveys</strong>. My goal was to create more than just a cool comic book cover, I wanted to capture the <strong>essence of the Fantastic Four</strong> as a family and a team.</p>

<p>By focusing on authenticity and shared human experiences, I hope the image resonates with others. Even in superhero art, grounding characters in relatable moments makes them more engaging and memorable.</p>
