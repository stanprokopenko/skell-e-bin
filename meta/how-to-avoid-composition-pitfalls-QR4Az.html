<h2>Don'ts in Composition</h2>

<h3>Avoid Tangencies</h3>

<p>Tangencies occur when two separate elements in your illustration <strong>just barely touch</strong>, creating awkward visual tension or flattening the image. For example, if a boat on a lake aligns perfectly with a fence in the foreground, it may look like a toy boat sitting on the fence.</p>

<p><strong>How to Avoid Tangencies:</strong></p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Overlap Elements:</strong> Push one element in front of the other to create depth.</li>

<li><strong>Create Space:</strong> Leave clear gaps between objects to prevent unintended connections.</li>

<li><strong>Plan Ahead:</strong> Use thumbnails to identify and resolve potential tangencies early in your process.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Avoid Corners</h3>

<p>Corners inherently <strong>draw the viewer's eye out of the composition</strong>. Anything pointing toward or occupying a corner can unintentionally lead attention away from your focal point.</p>

<p><strong>How to Handle Corners:</strong></p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Trim the Corners:</strong> Create dead space in corners or use foreground elements to "picture corner" your illustration, effectively cutting off the corners.</li>

<li><strong>Direct Attention Inward:</strong> Arrange elements to guide the viewer back toward the center or main action.</li>

<li><strong>Avoid Pointing Outward:</strong> Steer clear of shapes or lines that lead the eye toward the corners.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Avoid Sameness</h3>

<p><strong>Repetition of shapes, sizes, or patterns</strong> can make your artwork feel boring and mechanical. The human eye craves variety and is quickly disengaged by monotonous elements.</p>

<p><strong>How to Introduce Variety:</strong></p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Vary Sizes and Scales:</strong> Make sure characters or objects aren't all the same size or occupying the same amount of space.</li>

<li><strong>Alter Positions:</strong> Push some elements into the foreground and others into the background.</li>

<li><strong>Break Symmetry:</strong> Avoid mirroring elements exactly, introduce slight differences to keep the viewer engaged.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Do's in Composition</h2>

<h3>Create Variety and Contrast</h3>

<p>Introduce <strong>juxtaposition</strong> in your artwork to make it more dynamic.</p>

<p><strong>Techniques:</strong></p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Use Negative Space:</strong> Frame your subjects creatively by manipulating the space around them.</li>

<li><strong>Balance Elements:</strong> Employ an informal symmetry by offsetting large shapes with smaller ones.</li>

<li><strong>Play with Positioning:</strong> Tilt shapes, adjust their placement, and avoid centering everything to add interest.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Use Strong Value Separation</h3>

<p>Simplify your image by breaking it down into <strong>three key values</strong>: dark, middle, and light. This helps in designing a compelling composition and creates depth.</p>

<p><strong>Steps:</strong></p>

<ol>

<li><strong>Start with Thumbnails:</strong> Sketch small versions of your composition focusing on the three values.</li>

<li><strong>Design with Silhouettes:</strong> Use strong shapes to define your subjects and foreground elements.</li>

<li><strong>Layer Your Values:</strong> Assign dark values to foreground elements, middle values to mid-ground, and light values to the background (or vice versa) to enhance depth.</li>

</ol>

<h3>Create Movement</h3>

<p>Incorporate <strong>implied movement</strong> to add energy and a sense of time passing in your artwork.</p>

<p><strong>Ways to Show Movement:</strong></p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Dynamic Poses:</strong> Position characters in active stances, like mid-stride or post-action.</li>

<li><strong>Flowing Elements:</strong> Use hair, clothing, or capes blowing in the wind to indicate motion.</li>

<li><strong>Environmental Effects:</strong> Add smoke, mist, or other atmospheric elements moving across the scene.</li>

<li><strong>Expressive Features:</strong> Depict facial expressions that convey emotion and action.</li>

</ul>

<p><strong>Benefits of Movement:</strong></p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Engages the Viewer:</strong> Movement draws the eye and keeps the viewer interested.</li>

<li><strong>Adds Depth:</strong> Suggests a narrative beyond the static image.</li>

<li><strong>Guides the Eye:</strong> Leads the viewer through the composition in a controlled way.</li>

</ul>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p>By mindfully applying these do's and don'ts in your artwork, you'll create more engaging, dynamic, and visually appealing compositions. Remember to plan ahead, vary your elements, and always consider how each part of your illustration guides the viewer's eye and emotions. Happy creating!</p>
