<p>I enjoy drawing, painting, and sculpting, especially in a stylized way. Today, I'll share one of my digital painting processes to take an illustration from a <strong>sketch</strong> to a somewhat finished <strong>rendering</strong>.</p>

<h2>Steps in My Process</h2>

<ol>

<li><strong>Start with a Sketch</strong>: I focus on the <strong>largest shapes</strong>, keeping things loose and having fun with stylization.</li>

<li><strong>Add Values</strong>: I slowly build up the values, thinking about <strong>shadows</strong> and how they define the forms.</li>

<li><strong>Add Color Using Layer Modes</strong>: I apply color on top of the values, similar to a black-and-white-to-color process.</li>

<li><strong>Merge Layers and Paint on Top</strong>: Finally, I merge all the layers and refine the painting.</li>

</ol>

<h2>Starting the Sketch</h2>

<p>I begin by focusing on the <strong>largest shapes</strong> of my subject. It's important not to get caught up in the details at this stage. I think about the <strong>head angle</strong> and how features align within the shape. For example, if the head is tilted down, the ears sit higher on the head.</p>

<p>I keep my lines <strong>loose and sketchy</strong>, not being too precious. This is the <strong>ultimate freedom stage</strong> where I can experiment and <strong>have fun</strong>. I might exaggerate features or play with expressions. Flipping the canvas helps me see the drawing from a new perspective and spot any issues.</p>

<h2>Refining the Sketch</h2>

<p>After the initial sketch, I <strong>reduce the opacity</strong> of the layer and <strong>draw over it</strong> to refine the shapes. I consolidate my lines into more confident strokes, making decisions about the design and structure. I think in both <strong>2D shapes</strong> and <strong>3D forms</strong>, considering how the features sit in space.</p>

<p>I may repeat this process of reducing opacity and drawing over the top <strong>as many times as needed</strong>, refining both the line work and my thinking. During this stage, I'm not afraid to make <strong>big changes</strong> if something isn't working.</p>

<h2>Thinking in 3D and Adding Values</h2>

<p>I start to consider the <strong>planes of the face</strong> and how light will interact with them. I might indicate some <strong>shadow patterns</strong> to help visualize the lighting scenario. Flipping between 2D and 3D thinking allows me to refine ambiguous areas.</p>

<p>I pay attention to features like the <strong>eyes</strong>, treating them as spheres and ensuring they sit correctly within the sockets. Understanding the <strong>perspective</strong> and <strong>tilt</strong> of the head is crucial.</p>

<h2>Finalizing the Sketch</h2>

<p>Before moving on to adding values, I make sure I have a <strong>clear understanding of the shapes and forms</strong>. This foundation is essential for building up the painting in the next stages. I might add small details, like indicating missing teeth for character, or refining the ears and neck.</p>

<p>Throughout this process, I <strong>iterate</strong> and <strong>refine</strong>, aiming for a sketch that provides a solid base for adding values, colors, and eventually rendering the final piece.</p>
