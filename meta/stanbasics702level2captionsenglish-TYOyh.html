<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>You warmed up with level 1 blobs. Now you add a bit of right and wrong. You draw something real. You draw heads. These are blobby heads, so you still have room for error. Think in <strong>3D blobs</strong>, not flat shapes. Focus on <strong>plane changes</strong>, <strong>cross-contours</strong>, and especially <strong>edges</strong>. The goal is to simplify the head into big, clear masses and then shade them like real forms under a light.</p>

<h2>Start with a super simple version</h2>

<p>Begin with an egg for the whole head.</p>

<ul>

<li>Imagine the head as one egg. Place the light. Give it a clean tone.</li>

<li>Make the top edge softer.</li>

<li>Add a blobby nose. Keep it simple. The nose has <strong>firmer edges</strong>.</li>

<li>Indicate the <strong>bottom plane</strong> of the nose. That edge is also firm.</li>

<li>Add the <strong>cast shadow</strong> from the nose.</li>

<li>Adjust the edge of the face shadow:<ul>

<li>The forehead is very rounded, so keep that edge very soft.</li>

<li>As it goes down toward the chin, make it firmer.</li>

<li>It transitions from soft to firmer. That transition reveals the form.</li>

</ul>

</li>

</ul>

<p>This is not a portrait. You are inventing. You think about light and edges on simple forms at the same angle and light direction as your reference.</p>

<h2>Break the head into blobs</h2>

<p>Now do a slightly more detailed version. Still keep it simple. No eyelids, no creases, no wrinkles, no ears, no hair. Just basic blobby shapes.</p>

<ul>

<li>Cranium: a rounded mass. You can tweak it to match the person’s head. Add corners if it looks squarer. Think in 3D and wrap a <strong>cross-contour</strong> around it.</li>

<li>Jaw: a separate blob that extends from the cranium. Consider the shape and add edges for <strong>plane changes</strong>.</li>

<li>Nose: a very simple triangular blob. Proportions do not matter here.</li>

<li>Brow ridge: add it if you see it. Sometimes it pops out like a big mass above the eyes with a sudden plane change.</li>

<li>Eyeballs: spheres tucked into the eye sockets. No eyelids. Keep it weird and simple.</li>

<li>Muzzle: think of a tuna can with a chunk cut out. It bulges forward and wraps around. No lips. Just the muzzle.</li>

<li>Cheek masses: little ovals for the cheeks. It is not just the bone. Include the mass and any fat that expands that area.</li>

</ul>

<p>Use simple <strong>rhythms</strong> to find plane changes. Keep reminding yourself: it is not a shape, it is a <strong>3D blob</strong>.</p>

<h2>Shade the blobs</h2>

<p>Start with the big forms. Imagine these blobs lit the same way as your reference. Do not copy shapes. Invent the shading on your simplified forms.</p>

<ul>

<li>Cranium: shade the exposed area. As it meets the brow ridge, you get a shadow before the nose. That edge there is pretty firm.</li>

<li>Eyeballs: light from top right means the balls are lit on the top right. Keep the silhouette edges of the balls sharp. Make the internal form transition soft so the balls feel round.</li>

<li>Cheek vs eyeball: from the ball to the cheek is a sudden plane change. Keep that edge sharp.</li>

<li>Nose: the bridge and ball of the nose are a little softer. Keep edges firmer than the forehead, but softer than the eyeball silhouette.</li>

<li>Cheekbone: light from top right means bottom left of the cheek mass is in shadow. It is firm, but softer than the nose. Very soft like the forehead.</li>

<li>Muzzle: it wraps around, so you get a side plane and a bit of a bottom plane. There is a bottom edge to that “can.” Add the <strong>cast shadow</strong> from the nose. Keep that cast shadow edge sharp.</li>

<li>Continue the muzzle’s soft transition even where the cast shadow covers it. The form keeps going under that shadow.</li>

<li>Jaw: most of it is covered by other blobs. The exposed bit near the bottom is in shadow with a firm edge.</li>

</ul>

<p>On the far side:

- Add a gentle halftone on the cranium as it wraps. Very soft.

- The brow ridge gets only a halftone on top. Very soft transition.

- The jaw plane is a little darker. It transitions softly to the cheek, but is a bit sharper near the jawline.</p>

<p>You are controlling edges:

- Very soft on rounded areas like the forehead.

- Firm where the turn is stronger, like the brow ridge or jaw plane.

- Sharp at sudden plane changes and cast shadows, like the eyeball silhouette and the nose cast shadow.</p>

<h2>Adjust and keep it simple</h2>

<p>Blobs are easy to push around. If a placement is off, move it. Fix perspective by sliding a blob. Do not add details. Keep the forms simple and clean. Remember, you are not drawing a portrait. You are drawing a blobby version at the same angle and light direction.</p>

<h2>Practice</h2>

<ul>

<li>Use the provided portrait photos. Do the super simple egg version. Then do the slightly more detailed blobby version with cranium, jaw, nose, brow ridge, eyeballs, muzzle, and cheeks.</li>

<li>Make it harder: keep the same blobs and same angle, but change the <strong>light direction</strong>. You must invent. Adjust the shapes and edges to fit the new light.</li>

<li>Use your simplification and imagination skills. Focus on the <strong>edges</strong>.</li>
