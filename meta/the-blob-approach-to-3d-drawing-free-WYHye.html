<h2>What's in Premium?</h2>

<p>In this lesson, you'll learn a practical approach to drawing in perspective by starting with simple shapes—blobs—instead of relying on vanishing points and rulers. You'll discover how to transform these blobs into precise forms by adding lines and corners. The lesson dives into how convex and concave curves create the illusion of depth, helping you train your perception and improve your drawing skills. By practicing these techniques, you'll advance in constructing three-dimensional objects confidently.</p>
