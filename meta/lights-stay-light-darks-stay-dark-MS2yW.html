<h2>Two-Value Basics</h2>

<p>I like to think of value relationships in their simplest form: <strong>light</strong> versus <strong>dark</strong>. If I start with white for the light side and black for the dark side, I essentially get two basic buckets. Grays are simply lighter or darker versions of those buckets, but the essential rule stays the same: <strong>keep the lights light and the darks dark</strong>. If I accidentally match a value in the light side to a value in the dark side, I flatten the form and lose the illusion of volume.</p>

<h2>Why Values Define Planes</h2>

<p>Every time we see a different value, our eyes interpret that as a change in plane. So if two areas share the same value, they can appear to be on the same plane, and flatten out. To avoid this, I try to push each side of the form, light or shadow, so they remain visually distinct. It’s better to emphasize the difference and keep the illusion of volume, rather than risk flattening.</p>

<h2>Expanding Value Ranges</h2>

<p>Once I’m comfortable with a two-value mindset, I can expand the idea into multiple ranges. I pay attention to how much range I put in the lights versus the shadows.</p>

<h3>Range in the Lights</h3>

<p>Many artists put most of their value gradation and details in the lights and keep the shadows very simple and flat. <strong>Waterhouse</strong> and <strong>Fechin</strong> often show only a small change of value in the shadows (maybe just a slightly darker core shadow) but invest a lot of subtle shifts in the light areas. Sometimes 90% of the painting is in light, with just 10% in shadow.</p>

<p>When pushed to an extreme, this approach becomes chiaroscuro, as seen in <strong>Caravaggio</strong> or <strong>Rembrandt</strong>, where the lights are very light and the shadows are very dark. Details and color sit almost entirely in the light planes, while the shadows can become non-color brown or near black.</p>

<h3>Range in the Shadows</h3>

<p>Some artists flip it. They keep the lights simple and put a broad range of values in the shadows. <strong>Tiepolo</strong> sometimes shows rich detail in the shadow side, whereas the lit side remains almost a single value. This approach often feels like strong sunlight outdoors, where the lit areas are blasted out.</p>

<p><strong>Raphael</strong>, in some drawings, places a detailed range in the shadow planes, while the light planes get minimal shading. He might use soft edges or hatching to transition, but the overall idea stays the same: one value group for the lights, expanded values in the shadows.</p>

<h3>Value Ranges in Both</h3>

<p>Sometimes, I want a full range of values in both lights and shadows. <strong>Piazzetta</strong> might do a painting where there’s detail everywhere, and <strong>Meng</strong> might do the same. Even so, there’s a tendency to keep the two groups separate to avoid confusion. Values can overlap, but to preserve depth, there’s usually a <strong>core shadow</strong> or <strong>cast shadow</strong> edge that signals where the light changes to dark.</p>

<h2>Box Logic and Gradation</h2>

<p>I often think of forms as boxes to keep things structured: front, side, and bottom planes. <strong>Different value, different plane</strong> keeps the form turning. I can soften these edges with gradation and turn them into rounded transitions. But the box logic remains an underlying guide.</p>

<p><strong>Tiepolo</strong> sometimes uses a “ragged edge” when painting in watercolor or wash, creating the illusion of a soft edge by breaking up a hard boundary. <strong>Raphael</strong> might hatch along the edge or blend it, but the basic principle is the same: keep lights and shadows defined.</p>

<h2>Choosing Where to Place Range</h2>

<p>Outdoors, artists like <strong>Sorolla</strong> often show how the sun’s brightness washes out detail in the lights, while indirect light bounces into the shadows and creates more subtle value and color variations there. Indoors, chiaroscuro can give a dramatic balance of powerful highlights and deep shadows, with plenty of mid-value transitions.</p>

<p>No matter which strategy I adopt, range in the lights, range in the shadows, or a bit in both, I need to keep them from competing. If two areas share the same value but live in separate planes, I’ll often separate them with a stronger edge or a clear core shadow so the form doesn’t collapse.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p>When I’m in doubt, I always remember: <strong>simplify</strong>. Keep the basic rule that lights don’t overlap with darks, and different values represent changes in planes. From there, I can decide whether to expand the range in the lights, the shadows, or both. By paying attention to edges, core shadows, and how far I push each value, I can create a convincing sense of depth and form in my work.</p>
