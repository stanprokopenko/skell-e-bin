<h2>Goal</h2>

<p>You’re moving from level 1 blobs to something with a bit of right and wrong. Draw real heads, but keep them as <strong>blobby heads</strong>. You have room for error. The goal is to <strong>think three dimensionally</strong>, simplify into big masses, and <strong>focus on the edges</strong>.</p>

<p>You’re not drawing flat shapes. You’re drawing <strong>3D blobs</strong> with <strong>plane changes</strong> and <strong>cross-contours</strong> you can feel.</p>

<h2>Start Simple: The Egg Version</h2>

<p>Begin with the simplest version to train your eye and brain. You’re inventing a lot here, which can be harder than copying.</p>

<ul>

<li>Start with an <strong>egg</strong> for the whole head.</li>

<li>Place the light. For example, from the top right.</li>

<li>Fill a clean tone on the shadow side. Keep the top <strong>softer</strong>.</li>

<li>Add a <strong>blobby nose</strong>. Give the nose edges more <strong>firmness</strong> than the egg.</li>

<li>Add the <strong>bottom plane</strong> of the nose. Also <strong>firm</strong>.</li>

<li>Draw the <strong>cash shadow</strong> coming off the nose. Keep that edge <strong>sharp</strong>.</li>

<li>Adjust the edge of the big face shadow:<ul>

<li>The <strong>forehead</strong> is very rounded, so keep it <strong>very soft</strong>.</li>

<li>As it goes down toward the <strong>chin</strong>, make it <strong>firmer</strong>.</li>

<li>Let it <strong>transition</strong> from soft to firm.</li>

</ul>

</li>

</ul>

<p>These <strong>edges reveal the forms</strong>. It’s not the model. It’s a simple form with the same angle and light as the model.</p>

<h2>Build the Blobby Head</h2>

<p>Use a reference head (like Yoni), but keep it simple. You can push proportions. You’re not using the Lumous method here, just stacking blobs.</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Cranium</strong>: A rounded mass. If the person’s cranium is squarer at the top, <strong>add corners</strong>. Think cross-contour wrapping around.</li>

<li><strong>Jaw</strong>: A separate blob that extends from the cranium. Indicate <strong>plane changes</strong> with edges. Think in 3D.</li>

<li><strong>Nose</strong>: A very simple, almost <strong>Elmo-ish</strong> triangular blob. Proportions don’t matter. Just think 3D and how <strong>edges</strong> will act in light.</li>

<li><strong>Brow ridge</strong> (optional): Sometimes a big mass with a <strong>sudden plane change</strong> at the eyebrows. Forehead pops out, then back in under the eyes.</li>

<li><strong>Eyeballs</strong>: Two <strong>spheres</strong> dropped into the eye sockets. No eyelids or creases. They will look weird. That’s fine.</li>

<li><strong>Muzzle</strong>: No lips. Imagine a <strong>tuna can</strong> with a chunk chopped off. It comes forward and also out to the sides. It’s a <strong>bloated</strong>, rounded mass over the lips.</li>

<li><strong>Cheekbones/Cheek mass</strong> (optional): Little <strong>ovals</strong> for the whole cheek mass. Sometimes fat makes it more prominent.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Think in 3D</h2>

<ul>

<li>It’s not a flat ellipse around every mass.</li>

<li>Find the <strong>strong plane changes</strong> and indicate them with edges or subtle cross-contours.</li>

<li>Use <strong>rhythms</strong> to follow how forms connect.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Shade the Blobs</h2>

<p>You’re not copying shapes from the photo. Imagine how your blobs would look if lit the same way as the model.</p>

<h3>Cranium and Brow Ridge</h3>

<ul>

<li>Start with the <strong>big form</strong> of the cranium.</li>

<li>As the cranium meets the <strong>brow ridge</strong>, place the <strong>shadow</strong> that runs toward the nose.</li>

<li>That edge at the brow ridge is <strong>firm</strong> where the plane turns suddenly.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Eyeballs</h3>

<ul>

<li>With light from the top right, the eyeball is lit on the top-right.</li>

<li>Keep the <strong>silhouette edges</strong> of the eyeball <strong>sharp</strong>.</li>

<li>Inside the form, keep transitions <strong>soft</strong> so it feels round.</li>

<li>Where the eyeball meets the cheek, show the difference:<ul>

<li><strong>Very rounded</strong> plane change in some spots.</li>

<li><strong>Firm</strong> plane change in others.</li>

<li>Sometimes it’s in between, not sharp or soft.</li>

</ul>

</li>

</ul>

<h3>Cheekbone</h3>

<ul>

<li>Light from top right puts the <strong>bottom-left</strong> of this blob in <strong>shadow</strong>.</li>

<li>That shadow edge is <strong>firm</strong>, but <strong>softer</strong> than the bridge of the nose.</li>

<li>It’s actually very <strong>soft</strong> on rounded forehead and cheek areas.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Muzzle and Nose</h3>

<ul>

<li>The <strong>muzzle</strong> wraps around into a <strong>side plane</strong> and has a small <strong>bottom plane</strong>.</li>

<li>Mark the <strong>bottom edge</strong> of that “can.”</li>

<li>Draw the <strong>cash shadow</strong> off the nose. Keep it <strong>sharp</strong>.</li>

<li>Even if the start of the muzzle edge is covered by the cash shadow, continue the <strong>soft</strong> transition beyond it.</li>

<li>The area under the nose and under the can edge stays in <strong>shadow</strong>.</li>

<li>If your nose blob ends up wider than the model’s, that’s fine. You’re using the model as <strong>inspiration</strong> for your blobby dude.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Jaw</h3>

<ul>

<li>Much of the jaw will be covered by eyeball, nose, cheek, and muzzle blobs.</li>

<li>The small exposed part low on the jaw is <strong>pretty firm</strong>.</li>

<li>A <strong>very little piece</strong> of the bottom might be visible in <strong>shadow</strong>.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Other Side and Halftones</h3>

<ul>

<li>Round forms stay <strong>soft</strong>. Revisit edges and lighten lines that are too dark.</li>

<li>Replace heavy construction lines with <strong>half tones</strong> and <strong>very soft</strong> transitions.</li>

<li>As forms wrap to the left, keep it <strong>very soft</strong>.</li>

<li>Drop in the other eyeball. Don’t draw eyebrows. Place and fix blobs as needed. Use an <strong>eraser</strong> to sharpen edges or correct perspective.</li>

<li>Hair may cover forms, but you can still add a gentle <strong>half tone</strong> wrapping around the cranium.</li>

<li>The jaw plane can be a little darker with a <strong>very soft</strong> edge into the cheek, and a <strong>more sharp</strong> edge where the jaw is firmer.</li>

<li>Even in <strong>half tone</strong> areas, vary the edges:<ul>

<li>This part is a little <strong>sharper</strong>.</li>

<li>This is <strong>soft</strong>.</li>

<li>This is <strong>even softer</strong>.</li>

</ul>

</li>

</ul>

<h2>Practice</h2>

<ul>

<li>Use the provided portrait photos. Download them and do both versions if you want: the <strong>egg</strong> and the <strong>slightly detailed blobs</strong>.</li>

<li>Make it harder: keep the <strong>same shapes</strong> and <strong>same angle</strong>, but <strong>change the light direction</strong>. Now you have to invent.</li>

<li>You can’t rely on the reference for the shadows, but it will be easier after your study because you understand what each <strong>blob</strong> is doing.</li>

<li>Adjust all the shadow shapes and edges to fit the new light.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Key Reminders</h2>

<ul>

<li>Keep forms <strong>super simple</strong>.</li>

<li>Always <strong>think three dimensionally</strong>.</li>

<li>Use <strong>cross-contours</strong> and <strong>plane changes</strong> to guide your edges.</li>

<li>Control your edges: <strong>soft</strong>, <strong>firm</strong>, and <strong>sharp</strong>.</li>

<li>You’re not trying to draw the person. You’re building a <strong>blobby</strong> version with the same angle and light.</li>

<li>Do your best and <strong>focus on the edges</strong>.</li>
