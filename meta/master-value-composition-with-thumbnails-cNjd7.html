<p>Let's practice everything you've learned about <strong>value composition</strong> in the past few lessons. In this project, you'll take reference images and explore several variations of value compositions.</p>

<h2>Project Instructions</h2>

<ol>

<li>

<p><strong>Get the Reference Images</strong></p>

<ul>

<li>Two photos are provided in the downloads.</li>

</ul>

</li>

<li>

<p><strong>Create Thumbnail Sketches</strong></p>

<ul>

<li>Do thumbnail sketches the size of your thumbnail or palm, or anything in between.</li>

<li>Simplify each sketch to just <strong>three values</strong>.</li>

<li>This is similar to the previous master studies project, except now <strong>you are the composer</strong>.</li>

</ul>

</li>

<li>

<p><strong>Use Your Creativity</strong></p>

<ul>

<li>Use your creativity muscles to find the versions of the value compositions that you like best.</li>

</ul>

</li>

<li>

<p><strong>Start Small and Simple</strong></p>

<ul>

<li>Begin with small and simple thumbnails to capture the main idea.</li>

<li>Play with that for a little.</li>

<li>If you attempt small and simple but end up with large and detailed, <strong>try again and simplify</strong>.</li>

<li>Sometimes it's easier to simplify on the second attempt after you've gotten that urge out to get all those details in.</li>

</ul>

</li>

<li>

<p><strong>Avoid the Temptation to Finish</strong></p>

<ul>

<li>I know the temptation to try to make a really nice finished piece.</li>

<li>The benefit of thumbnails is you can try many ideas quickly and not go down a long path you end up not liking.</li>

<li>Spend a little time thinking through the big idea first.</li>

</ul>

</li>

<li>

<p><strong>Explore Variations</strong></p>

<ul>

<li>After you finish that first thumbnail, do more quick iterations to explore value ideas.</li>

<li><strong>Try to do at least five iterations of each photo</strong>.</li>

<li>Play around by modifying groups of values.</li>

</ul>

</li>

<li>

<p><strong>Don't Fall in Love with Your First Idea</strong></p>

<ul>

<li>The first several ideas are usually not the best.</li>

<li>You gotta get them out.</li>

<li>Of course, there will be some cases when you hit it on that first try, but that shouldn't prevent you from exploring alternatives.</li>

<li>Don't fall in love with your first idea.</li>

</ul>

</li>

</ol>

<h2>Tips for the Project</h2>

<h3>Freedom in Portraits</h3>

<ul>

<li>In a portrait, you usually have a lot of freedom to do what you want with the background or the clothing.</li>

<li>Consider these questions:<ul>

<li><strong>Do you want the background to be darker to emphasize white hair?</strong></li>

<li><strong>What if the shirt and hand were both a mid value to reduce contrast?</strong></li>

<li><strong>What if you rearrange the value shapes for a totally different pattern?</strong></li>

<li><strong>What if, what if, what if?</strong></li>

</ul>

</li>

</ul>

<h3>Keep Edges Hard</h3>

<ul>

<li>Sometimes we might be tempted to add a gradation or a soft edge.</li>

<li><strong>Hard and soft edges have an effect, but let's keep them all hard for now.</strong></li>

<li>We will focus on edges later.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Simplify Environments</h3>

<ul>

<li>You don't have to add environment details or invent environments at all.</li>

<li>Just consider various <strong>abstract shapes</strong> that those environments would simplify to.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Consider Cropping</h3>

<ul>

<li>Consider how you want to crop your thumbnail.</li>

<li>You don't have to stick to the way the photo is cropped.</li>

<li>Maybe you want to add a bunch of empty space above.</li>

<li><strong>What effect does that have on the portrait?</strong></li>

</ul>

<h3>Tool Suggestions</h3>

<h4>Using Pencils</h4>

<ul>

<li><strong>Use a Dull Pencil</strong><ul>

<li>You might want your pencil to be kind of dull.</li>

<li>It will help you draw with larger value masses while avoiding details.</li>

<li>It's that fine pencil tip that might lead you to unnecessary details.</li>

</ul>

</li>

<li><strong>Benefits of Pencils</strong><ul>

<li><strong>Erasable</strong>: You can adjust your shapes and values as you go.</li>

<li><strong>Control</strong>: Pencils can give you more control of your shapes.</li>

<li><strong>Texture</strong>: Pencils pick up the texture of the paper, which some people find more aesthetically pleasing.</li>

<li><strong>Practice Pressure Sensitivity</strong>: They force you to practice that pressure sensitivity to get the value that you want.</li>

</ul>

</li>

</ul>

<h4>Using Markers</h4>

<ul>

<li><strong>Great Time to Use Markers</strong><ul>

<li>If you've got some markers, this would be a great time to whip them out.</li>

</ul>

</li>

<li><strong>Benefits of Markers</strong><ul>

<li><strong>Faster</strong>: The thick chisel or brush tip allows you to fill in large shapes very quickly.</li>

<li><strong>Value Separation</strong>: Because markers have predefined values, it's easier to get clear value separation.</li>

<li><strong>Simplification</strong>: Markers force you to think within the limited number of values and organize the values into those limited groups.</li>

<li><strong>Avoid Details</strong>: Because the markers are thick, it's much harder to control small detailed shapes, so markers force you to simplify your shapes and think of the bigger idea.</li>

</ul>

</li>

<li><strong>Practice with Both</strong><ul>

<li>You can choose to use pencils or markers for this project or try both.</li>

<li>Each has its benefits.</li>

</ul>

</li>

</ul>

<h2>Level Two Instructions</h2>

<ul>

<li><strong>New Reference Photos</strong><ul>

<li>You get two different photos in the downloads.</li>

</ul>

</li>

<li><strong>Start with Level One as a Warm-Up</strong><ul>

<li>You can start with the level one photos as a warm up.</li>

</ul>

</li>

<li><strong>Explore Many Versions</strong><ul>

<li>After exploring many versions, if you fall in love with one of your thumbnails, now's the time to do a bigger thumbnail with a little bit more details and with the option of a fourth and fifth value.</li>

</ul>

</li>

<li><strong>Size of Thumbnails</strong><ul>

<li>These could be the size of your hand or at most the size of two hands.</li>

<li>We still want to keep them relatively small to just practice the value composition.</li>

</ul>

</li>

<li><strong>More Challenging Photos</strong><ul>

<li>The level two photos are a bit more challenging.</li>

<li>There's more going on and there's more that you can explore, which means more that can go wrong.</li>

</ul>

</li>

</ul>

<h2>Final Advice</h2>

<ul>

<li><strong>Don't Add Pressure</strong><ul>

<li>Don't add that additional pressure on yourself to get these beautiful drawings.</li>

</ul>

</li>

<li><strong>Simplicity and Clarity Over Accuracy</strong><ul>

<li><strong>Simplicity and clarity are more important than accuracy</strong>.</li>

<li>I don't care if your proportions are correct.</li>

<li>I don't care if you captured the likeness or the fancy details.</li>

</ul>

</li>

<li><strong>Focus on Value Groups</strong><ul>

<li>I care if you made deliberate and confident decisions about your value groups and then clearly executed them in your small sketches.</li>

</ul>

</li>

<li><strong>Remember Key Principles</strong><ul>

<li><strong>Simplify for clarity</strong>.</li>

<li><strong>Control your value range and key</strong>.</li>

<li><strong>Create a clear hierarchy to guide the viewer's eye</strong>.</li>

</ul>

</li>

<li><strong>Good Luck!</strong></li>
