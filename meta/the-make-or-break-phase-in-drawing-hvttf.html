<h2>Starting with Big Shapes</h2>

<p>When drawing a portrait, I begin by focusing on the <strong>big shapes</strong>. I like to work from big shapes to small shapes, starting with an <strong>envelope</strong> or <strong>scaffolding shape</strong>. This helps me establish everything that's going to be included in the drawing.</p>

<p>I ensure the <strong>height-to-width ratio</strong> of my initial shape matches that of my subject. Taking quick measurements, I compare the width and height to maintain accurate proportions.</p>

<h2>Separating Hair and Face Shapes</h2>

<p>Next, I separate the <strong>hair shape</strong> from the <strong>face shape</strong>, thinking of them as <strong>silhouette one</strong> and <strong>silhouette two</strong>. I keep these shapes general, avoiding details like individual strands of hair. Instead, I aim for a big, general <strong>Lego hair wig shape</strong>.</p>

<h2>Establishing the Center Line and Features</h2>

<p>I then find the <strong>center line</strong>, separating the left and right sides of the face. I look for comparison measurements, such as how distances on one side relate to the other.</p>

<p>I divide the face into <strong>perfect thirds</strong>:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Brow Line</strong>: Top of the eyes.</li>

<li><strong>Nose Line</strong>: Middle third.</li>

<li><strong>Chin</strong>: Bottom third.</li>

</ul>

<p>Using <strong>rhythms</strong> popularized by Frank Riley, I incorporate placeholder lines for features without drawing them in detail. These rhythms help simplify the head's structure.</p>

<h2>Adjusting for Specificity</h2>

<p>With the basic structures in place, I adjust the contours to make the drawing look more specifically like the subject. I look for specific angles, slight tilts, and placements of features like the ears and mouth. For example, the <strong>mouth</strong> often falls about a third of the way from the bottom of the nose to the chin.</p>

<h2>The Two-Value Phase</h2>

<p>Moving into the <strong>two-value phase</strong>, I squint at the model to simplify the values into <strong>light</strong> and <strong>dark shapes</strong>. Using the side of my pencil, I keep it very general and focus on what I see when I squint. This phase is crucial because it defines the drawing, it is the <strong>make-or-break phase</strong> where you can't let anything slide.</p>

<h2>Refining with Additional Values</h2>

<p>After establishing the two values, I start dividing the dark and light shapes into two or three more values. This helps me build up to a <strong>five or six value drawing</strong>, which is usually enough. I avoid over-rendering and focus on making a powerful statement with the values I choose.</p>

<h2>Artistic Influences and Advice</h2>

<p>Some of my significant artistic influences include <strong>Jeff Watts</strong>, <strong>Phil Hale</strong>, <strong>Glen Orbik</strong>, and <strong>James Bama</strong>. They've shaped my approach to drawing and painting.</p>

<p>For aspiring artists unsure about their professional path, I recommend focusing on the <strong>fundamentals</strong> and developing a <strong>broad skill set</strong>. Trust the path and listen to those who have walked it before you. Remember that achieving greatness often requires significant sacrifices.</p>

<h2>Final Touches</h2>

<p>As I near the end of the drawing, I focus on the <strong>focal point</strong>, often the eyes, and add more detailed values there. I might build up the halftones and push into a full value range, especially around the focal point to draw attention.</p>

<p>Finally, I remove some of the construction lines that may age the subject and refine any highlights or details needed. I aim to create a balanced drawing that captures the essence of the subject without overworking it.</p>
