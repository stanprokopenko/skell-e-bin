<h2>Refining the Color Key</h2>

<p>Now let's take it to the next level. I'll take one of these color keys, and refine it. I have two versions, an interior and an exterior. I've drawn both a bit more, and I'm going to take the ideas and paint versions with a little more detail, not to a final illustration level, but just enough to make a beautiful color key.</p>

<h2>Setting Up the Canvas</h2>

<p>Let's start with the exterior and see what we can do. I have the line art on its own layer, set to <strong>multiply mode</strong> because it was done as a sketch. I can adjust the opacity and paint beneath it.</p>

<h2>Choosing Reference and Mood</h2>

<p>Let's go back to our reference. There are a few bits of key art here that are interesting to explore. We could go with a bright daytime scene with clouds and variety, but I'm quite liking this <strong>misty, moody, fire season</strong> type of feeling. I'll use that as inspiration and paint using it as a reference.</p>

<h2>Blocking in the Background</h2>

<p>I'll start by filling the whole canvas with a desaturated gray color as a starting point. On my Mac, it's Option + Delete to fill with the foreground color. For the sky, I'll choose a warm general tone to block it in. I want to create a transition, like the glow from bright gray colors into purples and then into a dark foreground, similar to what I'm seeing in the reference.</p>

<h2>Establishing Depth and Atmosphere</h2>

<p>What's nice about the fog is that the character is really going to stand out, and I want to have <strong>depth</strong>. I'll use layering to make the house stand out a bit, without making it too dark. I want the hotel to look like it's a little further back than the foreground character. The sun hasn't actually set, there's just so much smoke that it looks like sunset.</p>

<p>Using my line sketch as a guide, I'll place trees here and mountains there, and now I want to get that kind of glow. I'll begin with a red color to represent the sun and place it in the sky. Then, I'll work my way through color temperatures into oranges and yellows, creating a bright spot where the sun will be. I can also make my brush nice and small and put a little extra brightness where the sunlight is. From this, I can select some of the colors and let the sunlight actually hit the edge of my building, rim lighting it a little bit.</p>

<h2>Painting Reflections</h2>

<p>I notice in the reference that the sky's colors are reflected in the water below. Since I've envisioned a lake back here, I'll take the color of the sky and reflect it in the water. Water acts like a mirror, so it will reflect what's above it, albeit with some diffusion. There may be little bits of extra brightness hitting the water, which will help everything stand out, including the house and the character in the foreground.</p>

<h2>Adding Foreground Elements</h2>

<p>I have rows of trees, and I'll use gradient values to create layers that break up the silhouettes of the sky and mountains. Maybe a little of that sunlight is hitting the edges of the peaks, which will help give that layering. You can see how fast this can be done. By looking at the thumbnail, I can ensure that the composition is working and that I can understand the shapes of the characters and everything else in the scene.</p>

<h2>Understanding Soft Shadows and Ambient Occlusion</h2>

<p>Part of this process is <strong>learning to accurately paint lighting</strong>, which involves understanding the physics of light. Knowing how to do <strong>soft shadows</strong> and <strong>ambient occlusion</strong> is really important for this craft of painting color keys. I highly encourage you to study light.</p>

<p>One aspect of light is seeing soft shadows. For example, this house right now is all just kind of one flat color, and that's not what light does. When there is very soft light, like when the sun has set, there's going to be darkening into the corners. I'll select the color of the house and darken it slightly in all the grooves and corners. Under the porch, it will be darker because less light can get in. Under the edge of the roof, there will be a soft shadow where the roof line occludes some of the soft light coming from the sky. Painting in these soft shadows helps with our understanding of the shape and form of the house.</p>

<p>Ambient light comes first. I get those soft shadows in, and then everything can build on top of that. There will be a little darkening happening between trees as they get closer together, enhancing depth and form.</p>

<h2>Focusing Attention on the Character</h2>

<p>I'm constantly judging the thumbnail view to see if there's a good read. Right now, the character is kind of merging into the background, so I think I'll use that sunlight to <strong>rim light</strong> the character a little bit, as if a little bit of sun has come through and is hitting the foreground. This will draw extra attention and add more contrast.</p>

<p>Our eye will go to the <strong>highest contrast</strong>, so if the character has the lightest lights and the darkest darks, we'll likely look there first. I'll add some ambient occlusion under the shoulders and soft light throughout. Maybe the light spreads a little further, wrapping around from the character onto the hill, adding a slight shift in color and variance.</p>

<p>I don't want it too strong, though, because I still want it to feel very silhouetted, but I want to see some of those nice shapes and foreground elements that will help <strong>frame</strong> the image. I'll use bushes and plants to keep the eye in the frame by darkening the sides, which will definitely draw us to look at the character.</p>

<h2>Adjusting Colors and Atmosphere</h2>

<p>Maybe some of my soft shadowing on the hills or trees was a little too much, and I don't want to draw too much attention there. I want it to feel like there's just been a forest fire, really foggy with a lot of atmosphere and depth. I might lighten areas near the lake slightly to reduce contrast, and let the contrast of the character stand out more.</p>

<p>I'm going to experiment with adding another <strong>glow layer</strong> to see if increasing the smoke haze adds more saturation, like in the reference. If we let some of that light softly paint in a reddish glow, it can come into the foreground, adding some color complexity to a rather simple lighting setup. There are only two real light sources: the fill light of the sky and the direct sun.</p>

<p>I'll add a little bit of bloom around the character, and there we go. Looking at this as a thumbnail, I'm quite liking it. I think I've been able to extract the essence of this fire season type of look. Maybe the sky needs a little more brightness. I'll experiment by brightening the top of the sky with an orange tone, deciding whether I like that feeling or not. Maybe somewhere in between. I'll adjust the layer's opacity to find the right balance and then merge my layers together.</p>

<h2>Final Touches and Evaluation</h2>

<p>Here's my fire season color key. If I want to draw attention to the house, I could add a little glow of warm light inside. I'll create a new layer in <strong>add mode</strong> and paint in a little sliver of light, as if there's something happening there that'll subtly draw the eye. I have to look at it on and off to decide if it adds to the focal point.</p>

<p>I want to be able to turn off my line layer and look at the painting just for the lighting alone and see if I can understand it. I think I can. Perhaps there needs to be a little more darkening of rocks or the building itself needs more occlusion details in the windows. I want to see where the windows are, the bushes and shrubs, any of these little ledges on the porch. Maybe I can see the windows a bit more.</p>

<p>I'm aiming for this not to be comic book style with line art, I'm trying to make it look more <strong>photographically believable</strong>. Turning off the line art so the whole thing is just what it would look like if this was actually lit as a scene. I'm painting a color key for lighting artists, and I want them to understand my intentions with the whole thing, how much darkness is there in the shadows?</p>

<p>I don't need to refine this completely. I could go in and get these lines really sharp and clean. If I were doing an illustration, I would want to get all that subtle detail in there, but because this is just a color key, this seems good enough.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p>So, there's my color key for a smoky setup. By focusing on the mood, depth, and lighting, I've created a scene that captures the essence of a misty, moody, fire season environment.</p>
