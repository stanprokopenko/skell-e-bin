<p>We're moving into more challenging territory with our lessons on orthos. It's time to get serious and prepare yourself. Your schedule must be organized around this. Work this stuff out with a pencil. Theory is for know-it-alls and teachers, the important thing is to get this theory into your skills.</p>

<h2>Project Overview</h2>

<p><strong>Ortho Project Number One: Simple Extrusion on the Z-Axis.</strong> The project is straightforward: <strong>put your name in perspective.</strong> There are two ways to do it, and I recommend both.</p>

<h3>Method 1: Finished Illustration</h3>

<p>Create a beautiful, finished illustration of your name in perspective. If it feels too egotistical, use the name of someone you love. Some people will even pay to see their name in blocks!</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Use a ruler</strong> to make it accurate.</li>

<li><strong>Draw the letters twice</strong>: once for the front plane and once for the back plane, or at least some corners. This shows where to stop the extrusion.</li>

<li><strong>Project the shapes</strong> to their back plane using vanishing lines to a vanishing point.<ul>

<li>This step is important and can be challenging.</li>

<li>Without it, the back plane is a guess, which may be harder than you expect.</li>

</ul>

</li>

<li><strong>Connect the back lines</strong> to form the back plane, ensuring the forms are consistent.</li>

</ul>

<p>This method is similar to drawing two squares, running diagonals, and getting a 3D-looking cube. Only now, the back shape is smaller. How small? Run lines to a vanishing point to find out.</p>

<h3>Method 2: Rough Sketches</h3>

<p>Exercise a whole different muscle by doing this roughly, without a ruler.</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Draw 20 times in a week.</strong> If you enjoy it, aim for 100 times over the next two weeks.</li>

<li><strong>Experiment with many different directions.</strong> Stretch your brain by making something interesting in perspective using this easy method.</li>

<li><strong>Practice your freehand lines.</strong></li>

<li><strong>Start noticing letter forms.</strong> Use any alphabet you want to study.</li>

<li><strong>Use any shapes you like.</strong> ** This project isn't about lettering, it's about perspective, and we're keeping it simple, a face-on view like an ortho limited to one point.</li>

</ul>

<p>This method is less about creating a finished work of art and more about brainstorming and exploring ideas. You'll strengthen your idea-generating brain muscles.</p>

<h2>Understanding One-Point Perspective</h2>

<h3>Limits of One-Point Perspective</h3>

<p>You'll come up against the limits of one-point perspective, especially in how you must show that front face and where you can place the vanishing points.</p>

<h4>Vanishing Point Placement</h4>

<p><strong>Placing the vanishing point affects the effect:</strong></p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Vanishing point near the box?</strong> All is well.</li>

<li><strong>A little less near?</strong> All is well.</li>

<li><strong>Less near still?</strong> Well enough.</li>

<li><strong>Getting distant?</strong> Something's weird here.</li>

</ul>

<p>If the vanishing point swings far away from the front face, eventually the front face needs to swing away with it. This creates a second vanishing point elsewhere. It's not just too far left or right that creates distortion, too far above or below does too when there's only one point.</p>

<p>A front face with any distantly placed vanishing point calls out for a second vanishing point. <strong>We're learning the limits this way.</strong> When we step off the track, we need another point.</p>

<p>You'll learn exactly how this works when we study the picture plane and plan projection. When we study lenses, you'll learn how to play it for effect.</p>

<p><strong>One point is limited. ** You may tire of the limits, but here's the thing, </strong>one point works. ** It creates the illusion, flat, shallow, or deep. If you want to draw in perspective, this is a good place to start. It's a trick that attracts some very good artists. <strong>One point has power.</strong> **</p>

<h2>Using Instruments vs. Freehand</h2>

<p><strong>Sending a lot of lines back to a vanishing point</strong> can look dramatic but also crowd together awkwardly at infinity. You'd think infinity would have more room!</p>

<p>To make it easier:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Work larger</strong> and <strong>lighten up the lines</strong> as you approach the vanishing point.</li>

<li>With a long stretch of letters, <strong>lines at the extreme front ends become almost horizontal</strong>, making it difficult to control with a ruler.</li>

</ul>

<p><strong>Bonus benefits of taking a few of these to finish:</strong></p>

<ul>

<li>If instruments feel clunky to you, <strong>finishing a few illustrations can help you get comfortable with them.</strong></li>

<li>This is level one: <strong>leveling up with the instruments and getting something out of it at the same time.</strong></li>

</ul>

<p>If you like to draw, play with this. Start simply. You will learn.</p>

<h2>Experimenting with Letter Forms</h2>

<p><strong>Placing the vanishing point above or below</strong> introduces eye level and vertical position.</p>

<p><strong>Placing the point to the left or right</strong> introduces lateral position.</p>

<p>We are moving toward complex problems one point at a time.</p>

<p>If you understand one-point perspective already, <strong>rehearse it this week.</strong> ** As you experiment, you may discover that one-point perspective sets us up for, brace yourself, <strong>five-point perspective</strong>, the wide-angle thing.</p>

<p>If you're new to this, <strong>learn and practice one-point extrusions this week.</strong> One flat plane of anything facing us directly, extruded into deep space or not-so-deep space, makes it 3D.</p>

<h3>Inspiration Sources</h3>

<p>If you seek inspiration, <strong>Dover Publications has many collections of decorative alphabets.</strong> Looking through lots of letters can give you ideas.</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Design buildable words.</strong></li>

<li><strong>Notice how different letter styles can influence your design.</strong></li>

</ul>

<p>If you want instruction in lettering and graphic design, <strong>Michelle Donvito teaches lettering and graphic design.</strong> Go learn from her.</p>

<p>In this lesson, your project is to <strong>make flat letters thick.</strong></p>

<h2>Next Steps</h2>

<p>In our next set of lessons, your project will be to <strong>draw several things of your choice</strong> in a special way, with **no perspective. ** I'll explain in the next lesson, but start thinking about your choices of what to draw, from simple to complex.</p>

<p><strong>Put some names in space. Put some letters in space.</strong> That's the project. <strong>Put some names, shapes, and faces of planes in space.</strong> This is about exploring perspective, practicing your skills, and stretching your creative muscles. Enjoy the process and see where it takes you!</p>
