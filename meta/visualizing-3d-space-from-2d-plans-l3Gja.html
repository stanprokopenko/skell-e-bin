<h2>The Exercise: Transforming Plans into Elevations</h2>

<p>Your final project is a series of puzzles based on <strong>one plan</strong>. This plan shows you the <strong>width</strong> and <strong>depth</strong> but tells you nothing about the <strong>height</strong>. Your task is to <strong>make up the heights</strong> any way you want, which can be straightforward or more creative.</p>

<h2>Creative Freedom with Heights</h2>

<p>You can:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Invert</strong> positive parts into negative spaces and vice versa.</li>

<li><strong>Squash or stretch</strong> the height of any portion.</li>

<li>Even make one portion <strong>float above or below</strong> another, connecting them with little wires to clarify their positions.</li>

</ul>

<p>This exercise is excellent for your brain, and it's not hard if you use a <strong>template</strong>. Templates are provided to help you get started.</p>

<h2>Tracking Heights and Enhancing Illusions</h2>

<p>When drawing, use <strong>height lines</strong> to keep track of elevations. Take your time, <strong>every corner counts</strong>. Think carefully about which lines are on the other side, and <strong>fade them back</strong> to enhance the illusion of depth.</p>

<h2>Drawing Orthographic Projections</h2>

<p>To ensure accuracy, draw the <strong>side and front elevations</strong> (orthographic projections). You can do this either <strong>before or after</strong> your oblique views. If you draw the orthos first, conform your oblique view to them, and vice versa. Drawing multiple views stretches your awareness and helps you understand the <strong>true proportions</strong>.</p>

<h2>Exploring Different Views</h2>

<p>By changing your starting point, you can explore how variables affect other dimensions:</p>

<ul>

<li>If using a <strong>side view</strong>, play with the <strong>width</strong>.</li>

<li>If using a <strong>front view</strong>, play with the <strong>depth</strong>.</li>

</ul>

<p>Remember, a draft view is one flat view that needs more to complete it. This is pure <strong>three-dimensional thinking</strong>.</p>

<h2>Practice and Mastery</h2>

<p>If you find this challenging, start by <strong>copying examples</strong>. As you progress:</p>

<ul>

<li>Try creating new elevations based on the given plan.</li>

<li>Create your own forms from these plans.</li>

<li>See how many variations you can develop.</li>

<li>Go fully independent and make up your own plans, but keep them <strong>right-angled</strong> for now.</li>

</ul>

<p>Start simply before attempting more complex forms. While some may dive into complicated attempts with bevels, it's beneficial to begin with <strong>simple shapes</strong>.</p>

<h2>Using Isometric Graph Paper</h2>

<p>To simplify further, use <strong>isometric graph paper</strong>:</p>

<ul>

<li>No need for vanishing points, lines are at <strong>60°, 90°, or 120°</strong>.</li>

<li><strong>Foreshortening is predictable</strong> - you can count the units.</li>

<li>However, isometric perspective lacks the <strong>realism</strong> we get with vanishing points and only creates forms in a few fixed positions.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Templates and Next Steps</h2>

<p>Until you learn to place a plan in perspective on your own, use the provided <strong>templates</strong>. They fix the position as it spins left to right, allowing you to focus on creating flexible heights.</p>

<p>We'll use this thinking in our next lesson.</p>

<h2>Back to Orthographic Views</h2>

<p>The three basic views on the three axes are the basic <strong>one side at a time truths</strong> of how a thing occupies space. Draw from these plans, or if you're ambitious, create an ortho of anything you want to learn to draw from imagination.</p>
