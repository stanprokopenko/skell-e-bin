<h2>The Dynamic Bible Sketchbook</h2>

<p>I want to start by sharing an old favorite of mine, the <strong>Strathmore watercolor sketchbook</strong>. Back in 2016, this sketchbook became the foundation for what would become <strong>The Dynamic Bible</strong>, a collection of my lecture notes, visuals, and teaching methods that I've curated from my classes at Art Center and other schools. For about six months, I filled this sketchbook with pen and watercolor drawings and scanned them to create the book. Originally, I didn't intend to publish it, it was a personal project to see if people understood what I was teaching. But after encouragement from friends and followers, I launched a Kickstarter, edited the text, and successfully published it. This experience showed me how a sketchbook can have a specific <strong>purpose</strong> beyond just drawing, it can be used to <strong>produce something meaningful</strong>.</p>

<h2>Travel Sketchbooks</h2>

<h3>The Traveler's Journal</h3>

<p>Another sketchbook I cherish is the <strong>Traveler's Journal</strong> by Midori (now known as Traveler's Company). This leather-bound book is my go-to for <strong>traveling</strong>. I use it to <strong>collect everything</strong>, drawings, stickers, stamps, and even natural materials like birch bark and flora. Whether I'm sketching fountains in Italy, studying pitcher plants at the Arboretum, or documenting a taxidermy workshop on insects, this sketchbook becomes a <strong>visual journal</strong>. It's not just about drawing, I write down notes, observations, and experiences. It's a companion that goes with me everywhere, capturing moments from Australia to New Zealand and beyond.</p>

<h3>Accordion Sketchbooks</h3>

<p>I also enjoy working with <strong>accordion sketchbooks</strong>, which present a unique challenge. Since the pages unfold continuously, I think about how each image <strong>transitions</strong> to the next, ensuring a seamless flow. My first accordion book focused on aquatic themes, but as I continued, it evolved to include studies from Paris, dinosaurs, and historical figures like Abraham Lincoln. The continuous format pushes me to consider the <strong>design of the entire spread</strong>, not just individual compositions. It's a fun and creative way to explore different subjects and see how they connect.</p>

<h2>Larger Format Sketchbooks</h2>

<h3>Discovering New Materials</h3>

<p>I love experimenting with different sizes and types of sketchbooks. One of my favorites is a large-format sketchbook I found in Austria with paper that lays completely flat. The paper quality is fantastic, and I filled it with pen and marker studies ranging from Mongolian culture to figurative work and mechanical designs. Another is a handmade book from Italy with ragged, hand-pressed paper. Using these sketchbooks allows me to focus on <strong>single imagery</strong> and dive deeper into <strong>illustration</strong>, rather than just sketching.</p>

<h3>Capturing Experiences</h3>

<p>These larger sketchbooks often become a canvas for significant experiences. For instance, during my trips to Africa, I sketched live observations of lions and cheetahs in the Masai Mara. The energy and speed of these animals in the wild are incomparable to seeing them in a zoo. I also documented moments like the passing of <strong>Kim Jung Gi</strong>, capturing emotions and reflections through my drawings. These sketchbooks become deeply personal, filled with illustrations that hold special meaning to me.</p>

<h2>The Importance of Observation and Variation</h2>

<p>Throughout my sketchbooks, you'll find a vast array of <strong>themes and subject matter</strong>, from creatures and animals to vehicles and machines, from stylized cartoons to realistic portraits. It's not the subject itself that draws me in, it's the <strong>act of drawing</strong> - the process of visualizing and putting ideas on paper. Whether it's observational studies at museums or imaginative explorations, I embrace the <strong>evolution of process</strong> in my work.</p>

<h2>A Personal Relationship with Materials</h2>

<p>I have a profound <strong>relationship with my sketchbooks and materials</strong>. Each sketchbook is unique, often with a character of its own, like the old, raggedy book I found in Utah that smelled like a basement. The pens, the paper, the textures, all of these elements contribute to the experience of drawing. They speak to me, and influence how I express my ideas. Collecting and using these sketchbooks isn't just about art, it's about <strong>building a connection</strong> with the materials and the moments they represent.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p>Every sketchbook I fill is more than just a collection of drawings, it's a <strong>personal journey</strong>. They're companions that document my growth, experiences, and thoughts as an artist. Looking back at them, I remember where I was, how I felt, and what inspired me at the time. They hold immense value, not monetarily, but personally, and they continue to motivate me to <strong>observe</strong>, <strong>explore</strong>, and <strong>create</strong>. This is me, and these are the stories my sketchbooks tell.</p>
