<h2>Exploring Categories of Optical Illusions</h2>

<p>If you go through a book of optical illusions, you'll find that there are a few categories. One is the classic question: <strong>Are these two lines the same length?</strong> And here's a secret: they always are. <strong>Is this a perfect circle?</strong> It always is. Anytime an optical illusion asks if two lines are the same length, or if the circle is perfect, or if the line is straight, you can safely say yes and you'll always be right.</p>

<p>There's another category where you <strong>turn the page upside down or at 90 degrees</strong>. You'll always find the hidden face or the image transforms, Santa Claus who is really sad is now really happy. Eventually, you don't even need to turn the page upside down, you just assume it's going to be the same trick you've seen throughout the book.</p>

<p>When you were six or seven, you might have thought these were brilliant and clever, and they are. But if you want to find that <strong>childlike wonder</strong> again, here we go.</p>

<h2>Creating a Simple Optical Illusion</h2>

<p>Start with a set of <strong>six triangles that meet in the middle</strong>. Flat shapes come together in symmetrical and iconic harmony. But it's more than that. Watch. <strong>Thicken some lines</strong>, and it starts to take on the look of 3D.</p>

<p>Let's make it clear: <strong>we are looking down on a block</strong>. That's enough to create wonder. It's a flat surface, but it looks three-dimensional.</p>

<p>The same set of lines, by changing their contrasts, can do this. Now watch. <strong>Did you just see it turn upside down?</strong> ** We're **looking up at a block in isometric perspective. When there are no vanishing points, you can do that. If there were vanishing points and you reversed this, it wouldn't look like a block, it would look like a wedge or something.</p>

<h2>Understanding the Trick</h2>

<p>Of course, you might do this on the computer with those slick, clean lines that feel so official. But these were done with a mechanical pencil on bond and vellum. To draw these out precisely, it takes a <strong>T-square and triangles or graph paper to keep the angles consistent and precise</strong>.</p>

<p>With bond paper, a <strong>light box lets you trace over the outline</strong>. Pay attention to this: swap out which lines cover up the lines behind them. With vellum, you don't even need a light box. <strong>Vellum goes transparent the moment you put it down</strong>, but tape it down or mount it so it doesn't slip.</p>

<h2>Exploring Works by Sandro del Prete</h2>

<p>Let's look at some more pre-computer art - hand-drawn perspective projects. <strong>Look up Sandro del Prete</strong>. He explored this theme extensively. His <strong>impossible chessboard</strong> may tease your brain into exhaustion, or curiosity.</p>

<p>If you're curious, here's the trick. If you see the <strong>top edge as the front edge</strong>, receding lines go away down. And yet, if you see the <strong>bottom edge as the front edge</strong>, receding lines go away up. They contradict each other. One says, <strong>"I'm the front."</strong> The other says, <strong>"I am."</strong> Each wins until they meet in nowheresville here and here. It's front edge all around except for two twists where it isn't.</p>

<p>In fact, it's at those little lines at the edge, how that overlaps, where the ambiguity pivots. If you're the analytical type, <strong>choose favorite optical illusions and figure them out like this</strong>. Sandro's are worthy.</p>

<h2>Tips for Creating Your Own Optical Illusions</h2>

<p>If you want to do more than analyze, <strong>copy your favorites and vary them</strong>. If you're the creative type, <strong>make up your own</strong>. Start simply so that you don't get confused, and always <strong>rough it out first</strong>. If you're new to the tools, this is a way to get used to them. We're keeping it simple.</p>

<p>For this experiment, <strong>no vanishing points</strong>. <strong>Isometric, axonometric, paraline, oblique projections</strong> - the serious systems that architects use in their work - all have potential for play. <strong>Play with this</strong>, and it will get you to work.</p>

<h3>Additional Tips</h3>

<ul>

<li>

<p><strong>Try some directional swap-outs</strong>. Where one part overlaps another, trace over it and reverse the overlaps.</p>

</li>

<li>

<p><strong>Outline</strong>. That's pure outside contour, with no hint of one part in front of another. This allows you to choose either set of inlines that put one part in front of another.</p>

</li>

<li>

<p><strong>Ideate first</strong>. It's always good to make little rough sketches before deciding what's worth refining.</p>

</li>

</ul>

<h2>Challenges and Warnings</h2>

<p><strong>Warning</strong> - <strong>It takes concentration</strong>. Attending to lines - <strong>don't multitask</strong>. When you work on these projects, protect yourself from distractions.</p>

<p><strong>A challenge</strong>: This is a test to see whether you have the mental power to carry through with perspective problems. If you wear out your brain and you're willing to try again a day or a few hours later, do it. Perspective problems often yield to trying, coming up against brain freeze, thawing out, and doing that a few times before your brain skills flow.</p>

<p>And if you have a book of optical illusions, <strong>sort out the ones based on isometric perspective, and play around with them</strong>. If you enjoy this kind of thing, you will never be bored. People like doing crossword puzzles, this is the same thing but with lines. And it teaches you about accountable drawing. And if you're inventive, you can make things up.</p>

<p>I'm interested to see what people post. This kind of drawing is relatively easy to understand. So think of this as a start. It gets you familiar with limited sets of views and a kind of thinking that perspective is all about, <strong>creating an illusion</strong>.</p>

<h2>The Most Important Thing</h2>

<p>Well, this has been a lot. But if I had to boil it down to one thing that's most important, it's this: <strong>Rough it out first, it spares you pain</strong>. <strong>Rough it out first, it spares you pain</strong>.</p>
