<h2>What's in Premium?</h2>

<p>In this premium lesson, we focus on improving your drawings through better value relationships and contrast. You'll learn how to make shadows dark enough to enhance the lights, creating a dynamic range of values. We'll discuss organizing shapes by starting with big shadow masses and connecting shadows and lights for a cohesive structure. You'll discover how simplifying shapes with straight lines and contained edges can improve readability. We also cover using value tools wisely to avoid over-simplification and maintain essential details. Managing contrast effectively within your value range is key, and we'll show you how to ensure enough contrast without disrupting unity. Lastly, we'll emphasize the importance of accurate proportions and underlying structure to strengthen your drawings.</p>
