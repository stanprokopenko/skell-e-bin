<p>Now that we've completed the sketch portion of the process, it's time to start laying in some <strong>flats</strong>, which are the beginnings of getting our values in place. Some people refer to this as applying the <strong>local values</strong>. Even though there aren't too many different materials here, you'll notice that when we lay them in, the skin color will be a different value than the teeth, and that's going to be really important as we head into the next phase.</p>

<h2>Setting Up the Flats</h2>

<p>First, I like to organize my layers. I'll grab all the <strong>line work</strong> I've done and group it using <strong>Command/Control + G</strong>. If we're going to be good little digital artists, we should name our layers. So, I'll name this group "Line Work".</p>

<p>Next, I make a backup by duplicating the line work group. Then, I'll flatten the duplicate group by hitting <strong>Command/Control + E</strong>, so now it's just one layer with all the lines. This flattened layer will serve as our primary line work layer.</p>

<p>Now, I'll create a new layer underneath the line work, and start putting in our flats. I call them flats because they're flat colors, with no gradients or shading yet. I'm just going to block out the main shapes with flat values.</p>

<h2>Using a Plugin for Faster Flats</h2>

<p>I like to use a plugin that my friend Francis Lee and I created. It makes it easier to throw down some shapes quickly. As you can see, we can just use the lasso tool to draw shapes, and it fills them in automatically. If you don't have the plugin, you can do this by creating the shape with the lasso tool, then using the <strong>paint bucket tool</strong> to fill it in. It just takes a little bit longer, that's why we made the plugin. But for now, this is all we're going to use it for.</p>

<h2>Blocking in the Base Shape</h2>

<p>I'm going to encapsulate the whole shape of the character. I'll connect the lines to create a closed shape and fill it in. This will be our <strong>base shape</strong>. I'll keep this in a group and name it "Base". Everything else will be within this group.</p>

<h2>Using Clipping Masks</h2>

<p>To keep everything within the base shape, we'll use <strong>clipping masks</strong>. They're super useful. You can hold <strong>Alt</strong> and click between layers to create a clipping mask, or right-click on the layer and choose <strong>Create Clipping Mask</strong>.</p>

<p>What clipping masks allow us to do is draw and paint <strong>only within</strong> the base shape. As we add more layers on top, they stack while using the base shape as a mask. This way, we can keep layering and layering while keeping all the shapes within that one larger shape. We'll be using clipping masks a lot throughout the rest of this tutorial.</p>

<h2>Adding Local Values</h2>

<p>First, I'll add the <strong>eye local values</strong>. They're going to be a little bit lighter than the skin color. I'll quickly block in the whites of the eyes and the teeth. These shapes might change later on, but that's fine. Already, even at this stage, it's starting to bring out a little more clarity to what we're working towards.</p>

<p>Now we've got different materials, the teeth are a different material than the eyes, similar but different, and we've got the base skin color. This is a good place to start thinking about our values in terms of <strong>lights and darks</strong>.</p>

<h2>Starting with Shadows</h2>

<p>Now that we've got the flats, we're going to explore how to <strong>light</strong> this thing and make it feel more three-dimensional. I like to start with the <strong>shadows</strong>, where are my shadows? Where are my darks? That's going to really help solidify the final piece.</p>

<p>I'll create a new layer above the flats and set its <strong>layer mode</strong> to <strong>Multiply</strong>. At a simple level, multiply equals darker. There are other layer modes I'll use for lightening things, but multiply is great for darkening.</p>

<h2>Laying Down Shadows with Multiply Layers</h2>

<p>Using a gray color, I'll use the lasso tool to find those shadow shapes. The multiply layer darkens everything, but the benefit is that it keeps the context of the underlying layers. If we wanted to, say, add an eyeshadow, it doesn't completely wash out the details underneath.</p>

<p>For example, if we just put a color straight over the top with a normal layer, it would block out what's underneath. But with the multiply layer, it keeps everything in context, making it a very versatile layer mode that I use all the time.</p>

<p>I'm thinking about the light source as well, I'll be doing a <strong>top-down light source</strong>. So the nose will have a shadow here, and it might even cast a shadow onto the teeth. I'll darken the inner mouth, and indicate the eyebrows a bit.</p>

<p>I'll also consider the <strong>side planes</strong> of the head. If I want less impact, I can use a lighter gray to make a more subtle shadow. By adjusting the brightness of the color on the multiply layer, we can add subtlety to our values.</p>

<h2>Adding a Contrasting Background</h2>

<p>Another thing I like to do is add a <strong>contrasting background</strong>. Instead of having a stark white canvas, it's helpful to have a different value in the background to contrast with our subject. This is similar to how traditional artists will stain the canvas.</p>

<p>You could also stain the white background as well. For now, I'll choose a background color that contrasts with the character. We can always change it later.</p>

<h2>Refining Shadows and Values</h2>

<p>I'll create a <strong>soft round brush</strong>, nothing fancy, just the default Photoshop brush, and do an overall shadow pass. If our focal point is the head, all of this down here does not need to be super detailed. We can manipulate the eye to focus on the part of interest.</p>

<p>This is called <strong>light fall-off</strong>. Imagine a spotlight or point light above the character. As light falls off, areas further from the light source become darker.</p>

<p>We can always adjust the opacity of the shadow layer if we've gone too dark. I'll zoom back out to see how we're looking. Turning the shadows layer on and off helps us see the impact.</p>

<h2>Merging Layers and Refining Values</h2>

<p>Now I've got a good base. This is where I'll do my first merging into one layer, it's easier to refine. I'll duplicate my layers as a backup, then I will merge the working layers together.</p>

<p>I can turn the line work on and off, and see how it's reading. Even at this early stage, it should start to read without the line work, a good sign.</p>

<p>Now, since we've merged these layers, we can make larger changes more easily. I can start to manipulate values further, thinking about where the light source is and how it affects the forms.</p>

<h2>Adding Highlights with Screen Layers</h2>

<p>Next, I'll introduce another layer mode: <strong>Screen</strong>. Screen is almost the opposite of multiply. While multiply darkens and keeps context, screen lightens while keeping context.</p>

<p>I'll create a new layer set to Screen mode. Using a lighter gray, I can start adding <strong>highlights</strong>. For example, I might add highlights to the brow, nose, and cheeks.</p>

<p>I can also use selection tools to help refine these highlights. For instance, using the lasso tool to select an area, I can add a gradient to give the illusion of form.</p>

<h2>Iteration and Refinement</h2>

<p>At this stage, it's all about <strong>iteration</strong>. I might go back and forth between normal layers, multiply layers, and screen layers, refining the values and making sure the light source is consistent.</p>

<p>I also like to zoom out and look at the piece from different vantage points. I'm constantly tweaking values, adjusting shapes, and refining details.</p>

<p>I might add <strong>occlusion shadows</strong>, the darkest parts where light has the hardest time reaching, often in intersections like where the neck meets the jaw.</p>

<h2>Adding a Secondary Light Source</h2>

<p>We can also add a <strong>secondary light source</strong>. I'll create another layer set to Screen mode and imagine a light coming from the side or behind, creating a rim light effect. This can help separate the subject from the background.</p>

<p>It's important to add rim lights with intention, not just throwing a thin white line on the edge, but thinking about how the light interacts with the forms.</p>

<h2>Adjusting Details</h2>

<p>As I refine the painting, I might notice things that need adjusting. For example, the placement of the eyes, the shape of the eyebrows, or the size of the chin.</p>

<p>I can use tools like the <strong>smudge tool</strong> or transform tools to push and pull shapes as needed. If I want to test different placements, I'll duplicate the layer, make changes, and compare before merging.</p>

<p>I also keep an eye on the values, making sure they're working together. I might squint to see if anything pops out that shouldn't.</p>

<h2>Finalizing Values Before Color</h2>

<p>Before moving on to color, I want to make sure the values are working well. The more time you spend thinking about these features in the black and white phase, the better off you'll be.</p>

<p>I'll continue tweaking, adjusting forms, and refining details. Once I'm satisfied with the values, we'll be ready to start adding color.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p>Now we've got a solid foundation with our values in place. We've taken the initial sketch, added flats, used clipping masks, and built up our shadows and highlights using multiply and screen layers. We've refined the forms and adjusted the details.</p>

<p>In the next phase, we'll start adding color to this black and white painting. Stay tuned as we bring this character to life with color!</p>
