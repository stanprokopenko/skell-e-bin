<h2>What's in Premium?</h2>

<p>In this premium lesson, you'll learn how to <strong>draw an airplane using one-point perspective</strong>. We'll start by setting up a proper perspective grid, which is crucial for accurate foreshortening. You'll <strong>sketch the basic structure</strong> by dividing the airplane's body into sections and establishing key shapes. The lesson covers how to add the dome at the front, draw the tail with correct proportions, and include the stabilizing and main wings, all aligned with the perspective. Finally, we'll show you how to <strong>finalize your drawing</strong> by refining lines and adjusting details for precision.</p>
