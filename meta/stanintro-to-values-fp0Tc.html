<p>Values are awesome! If you want your drawings to look three-dimensional and create the illusion of form, you need to start adding <strong>values</strong> to your line drawings. Lines are great and they get us really far, but learning how to effectively use values can transform your art. Later, when we combine them with edges, it will feel like magic!</p>

<h2>What Are Values?</h2>

<p>When we talk about <strong>value</strong> in art, we're not referring to its "worth" or how much money it costs. A <strong>value</strong> is simply <strong>how light or dark something is</strong>. If we take a photo and make it grayscale, you see that the skin is lighter than the lips. Even though the color of the lips and the shadows are quite different, their values are much more similar—they're both kind of dark.</p>

<h2>The Role of Lines and Shapes</h2>

<p>We've learned a lot about lines. I hate to break it to you, but <strong>lines aren't real</strong>! We don't see lines. As artists, we use lines as a placeholder for the edges of shapes. Lines are a very useful tool for communicating ideas, but they're not what we actually see. They're an abstraction of what we see. What we actually see in reality is <strong>light as it affects forms</strong>. We see that light as an arrangement of <strong>colors</strong>. Shapes fill in with colors.</p>

<h2>The Components of Color: Hue, Chroma, and Value</h2>

<p>Color is made up of <strong>hue</strong>, <strong>chroma</strong>, and <strong>value</strong>.</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Hue</strong> is like the family of colors it belongs to—yellow, red, blue, and so on.</li>

<li>You can apply <strong>chroma</strong> to the hues to describe how pure or gray the color is. You can lower the chroma on a blue color, and it's still blue, but it's lower in chroma—a little more gray.</li>

<li>Finally, we can describe the <strong>value</strong> of any color, from white to black. This medium chroma blue is a value 6, but we can shift in either direction along the value scale. We can make any color lighter or darker.</li>

</ul>

<p>The relationship between these three properties of color can get complicated, and that's beyond this course. The most important part of color is <strong>value</strong>. It's so important, actually, that artists often categorize it separately.</p>

<h2>The Importance of Value in Art</h2>

<p>Let's imagine that a drawing is like a building. Each individual steel beam is like a <strong>line</strong>. Put those lines together to make <strong>shapes</strong>, and you get the steel framework of the building. <strong>Values are like the walls</strong>. They fill in the spaces between the framework, making it solid. Values create the illusion of <strong>form</strong>, <strong>depth</strong>, and <strong>volume</strong>. Beyond that, you have things like <strong>texture</strong> and <strong>color</strong>, which are like the decorations in the rooms—wallpaper, furniture. They're details that add to how your art feels.</p>

<p>All these elements are important. You take any one of them out and you don't really have a building you'd want to live in. But the walls, the floor, the roof—those are really important.</p>

<h2>Starting with Values Before Color</h2>

<p>As a beginner, it's wise to practice drawing without color. Just practice using <strong>value</strong> to focus on light and form. Once you're comfortable with values, then you can introduce <strong>color</strong> to add more emotional impact. I know it's really tempting to jump to color. But if you want the time you spend practicing to have the biggest impact, start with values.</p>

<h2>The Value Scale</h2>

<p>Now that we understand what value is, let's talk about how we can organize it in a way that's practical for drawing. Imagine a scale from 0 to 10, where 0 is the darkest black and 10 is the brightest white.</p>

<p>This can seem a bit counterintuitive if you think of value as pigment. When we draw, we start with white paper and add darker values with the pencil. But the system we'll be using in this course is the <strong>Munsell system</strong>. It's a traditional way of organizing color and value. Instead of measuring pigment, we're measuring <strong>light</strong>. When we're drawing, it's not very useful to think of the pigment. It's much more practical to be thinking of the subject we're drawing and how the light affects that subject. A value of 10 means that area is getting the most light, while a value of 0 means it's in complete shadow and we can't see anything.</p>

<p>Now, in reality, the value scale is a smooth gradient with an infinite number of values between black and white. But trying to work with infinity is not very practical for drawing and organizing values. That's why artists typically break it down into steps of values, usually about 10. This is more manageable and makes it easier to communicate. If I say "value number 3," you can imagine where that is on the scale.</p>

<p>Maybe you noticed, 0 to 10 is actually 11 total values in the Munsell value scale. Some people squish it to 10 and flip the order. But these numbers are just systems. The most important thing to understand is that there is a gradation from white to black, and you can split that into as many steps as you want.</p>

<h2>Using Value Scales in Drawing</h2>

<p>You don't always have to use all 10 values in every drawing. Sometimes, you might choose to work with a <strong>limited value scale</strong>. Maybe you decide to use 5 values, just enough to represent the main elements of light and shadow.</p>

<p>You can also play around with different <strong>value ranges</strong> within the scale. Maybe your drawing only uses values from 3 to 8, with no deep shadows or bright highlights. Or you could go for a moody drawing using only darker values from 0 to 5. We'll learn more about value ranges in another lesson and we'll practice with projects.</p>

<p>Our goal is to train your eye to see these subtle shifts in value and then translate them into something you can work with on paper.</p>

<h2>Factors Affecting Value Perception</h2>

<p>There are <strong>four things</strong> that determine the values we see:</p>

<ol>

<li><strong>Light on Form</strong></li>

<li><strong>Local Value</strong></li>

<li><strong>Surface Material</strong></li>

<li><strong>Atmosphere</strong></li>

</ol>

<p>For beginners, I highly recommend focusing mostly on those first two: <strong>light on form</strong> and <strong>local value</strong>. The second two are a little bit more advanced, and you should come back to them later. <strong>Surface material</strong> refers to what the object is made of. It could be matte or glossy or highly reflective, and that could greatly change the values that we see even if the light and the form are the same. <strong>Atmosphere</strong> refers to the effect of the air on how we perceive things far away. I mentioned this earlier in the course as <strong>atmospheric perspective</strong>.</p>

<h3>Light on Form and Local Value</h3>

<p>Going back to this photo, the value of my hair is darker than the value of my skin. That's <strong>local value</strong>. It's the inherent lightness or darkness of the thing, regardless of the light you shine on it. The local value of something isn't always consistent. This apple has a lot of variety in its local value and a general gradation from light to dark.</p>

<p>Even though my hair is darker than my skin, the value of the shadow on my skin is darker than the highlights on my hair. That's <strong>light on form</strong>.</p>

<p>You know that when you shine a light on something, it makes it brighter. The value goes up because there's more light. But the value doesn't go up evenly on the entire object. It gets distributed based on the form—where the planes are facing. The part of the object that faces towards the light gets affected the most. But as these planes start to turn away, they get affected by the light less, and so they get darker.</p>

<p><strong>Local value</strong> and <strong>light on form</strong> act together. Both of these apples are hit by the same light, but the light side of the red apple is darker than the yellow apple. And the same with the shadow sides.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p>I hope you're starting to see the value of <strong>values</strong>! There is a lot more to learn, but first I'll give you a simple warm-up exercise and project in the next two videos to get your hands dirty. See you in the next one.</p>
