<p>Welcome back! Today, I'm going to talk about painting <strong>color keys</strong>. Some of you might be asking, what is a color key? Throughout my career as a 3D lighting artist on films, I've relied on color keys to plan my work.</p>

<p>In film production, when we receive a scene, it often looks flat and lacks the depth and atmosphere that bring it to life. As lighting artists, it's our job to add the sun, sky, shadows, fill lights, bloom, reflections, refractions, essentially, all the details that make the scene beautiful. But we don't do this alone, we use <strong>color keys</strong> from the concept department to guide us.</p>

<h2>The Purpose of Color Keys in Film Production</h2>

<p>Color keys are <strong>small, loose paintings</strong> that show all the lighting information for key shots in a sequence. They help us plan the <strong>mood</strong>, <strong>time of day</strong>, and the intricate details of lighting, such as the amount of fog in the air, where sunlight hits, how it bounces, and the exposure levels. They are essential in ensuring that the lighting supports the emotion of the story.</p>

<p>You may have heard the term <strong>color script</strong>. A color script is a plan for the entire film. It outlines each sequence, determining the time of day, dominant colors, and the flow through the sequences. For example, in an early color script for <em>The Incredibles</em>, the beginning of the film is super saturated to represent Mr. Incredible's glory days. When it cuts to the present day, the colors become monochromatic and gray, reflecting a sad world. As the story progresses and he resumes his superhero work, more colors are introduced, culminating in a realistic and believable palette by the end.</p>

<p>Once we have the color script, we create <strong>color keys</strong> for individual sequences. These help us focus on specific shots and provide a detailed plan for the lighting.</p>

<h2>Planning Color Keys</h2>

<p>When planning a color key, we need to consider several factors:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Time of day</strong>: Is it midday, sunset, blue hour, or night?</li>

<li><strong>Lighting mood</strong>: Is it high key or low key?</li>

<li><strong>Atmospheric conditions</strong>: How much fog is in the air?</li>

</ul>

<p>These questions are crucial because <strong>lighting matters</strong>. It significantly impacts the mood and storytelling of a scene. The colors and lighting choices we make can enhance the emotion and effectiveness of the scene.</p>

<h2>Gathering References</h2>

<p>References are invaluable in this process. I often look at both real-life photography and films, as these images are crafted to evoke emotion and tell a story through lighting. For this demo, I gathered exterior references from movies like <em>Nomadland</em>, <em>Puss in Boots: The Last Wish</em>, <em>Raya and the Last Dragon</em>, <em>Avengers</em>, <em>The Bourne Legacy</em>, and <em>The Prestige</em>. These references showcase different lighting scenarios, from sunset to moonlit nights to foggy environments.</p>

<h2>Demonstration: Painting Color Keys</h2>

<h3>The Story Idea</h3>

<p>I have a simple story laid out in nine frames:</p>

<ol>

<li>A hiker walks in the forest and comes out into a clearing.</li>

<li>They see a big, abandoned hotel, possibly haunted.</li>

<li>They cautiously walk up to the steps.</li>

<li>They notice the door is slightly open with light coming from inside.</li>

<li>They open the door a little and look inside, seeing a glowing light at the top of the stairs.</li>

<li>A reaction shot of them thinking, "What is in there?"</li>

<li>They walk in and see a grand hall with a giant sculpture of a dragon.</li>

<li>A top-down view as they walk into the space and up the stairs.</li>

<li>They reach out for a glowing gem on the stairs, and there's a big explosion when they touch it.</li>

</ol>

<p>This simple story provides a transition from exterior to interior, allowing us to plan how lighting can affect the mood throughout the sequence.</p>

<h3>Exploring Time of Day and Lighting</h3>

<p>One of the first decisions is choosing the time of day. For example:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Sunset</strong>: The sun is low in the sky with warm atmosphere and bouncing light.</li>

<li><strong>Blue hour</strong>: Right after the sun has set, still light in the sky but no direct sunlight.</li>

<li><strong>Night</strong>: Moonlit or star-lit scenes with varying levels of darkness.</li>

</ul>

<p>We need to decide how the interior will be lit as well. Is it illuminated by glowing light at nighttime, or is exterior light coming in through windows?</p>

<h3>Experimenting with Different Moods</h3>

<h4>Nighttime Scene</h4>

<p>I started by flooding the frames with a cool blue to represent the night sky. To create contrast, I added a warm orange light emanating from inside the house. This combination of <strong>cool</strong> and <strong>warm</strong> colors draws the viewer's eye and enhances the mood.</p>

<p>As the hiker approaches the house, the interior glows with a reddish-orange light, which becomes more intense as they get closer to the glowing gem. When they touch the gem, there's a vibrant explosion of light with blue electricity effects, adding drama to the scene.</p>

<h4>Daytime Scene</h4>

<p>Next, I explored a daytime scenario. I used a bright blue sky with hints of cyan at the horizon to depict a <strong>beautiful day</strong>. The green hills and warm sunlight create a happy, inviting atmosphere. However, the house still appears dark and slightly ominous, providing a stark contrast to the cheerful surroundings.</p>

<p>As the hiker approaches the house, they move from sunlight into shadow, which introduces a feeling of unease. Inside, I utilized soft ambient light from a large window to illuminate the interior. The glowing gem is less pronounced in daylight, but still noticeable. Upon touching it, there's an explosion of light, albeit less dramatic than in the nighttime scene.</p>

<h4>Foggy Scene</h4>

<p>Finally, I experimented with a foggy environment. Flooding the frames with cool, misty tones, I aimed for a <strong>creepy, monochromatic</strong> feel. The thick fog obscures the mountains and partially hides the house, enhancing the mysterious atmosphere.</p>

<p>Inside the house, the light is limited and diffused, with ambient occlusion adding depth to the shadows. The glowing gem stands out more prominently against the muted background. The explosion of light upon touching the gem is striking against the foggy surroundings.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p>Whether you're creating color keys for an animated project or your own illustration, it's important to consider how lighting and color choices affect the mood and storytelling of a scene. By exploring different times of day and lighting conditions, we can find the most effective way to convey the desired emotions.</p>

<p>Remember, <strong>lighting matters</strong>. It plays a crucial role in enhancing the narrative and immersing the viewer in the world you've created. So take the time to ask those important questions and experiment with various options to find the perfect lighting for your story.</p>
