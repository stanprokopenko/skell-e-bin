<h2>Getting Started in Comics</h2>

<p>My name is Wils Portacio, and I've been working with Marvel for about <strong>40 years</strong>. As a kid, I loved film and dreamed of getting into film school, but I couldn't afford it. My cousin took me to the <strong>San Diego Comic-Con</strong>, where I got lucky. Marvel's senior editor <strong>Karl Potts</strong> was there on a talent search.</p>

<p>Karl saw potential in me and encouraged me to improve. He sent me "The Five Seasons of Cinematography" to study. He said, "Once you figure it all out, I'll give you a job." I took the challenge seriously and dove into learning storytelling.</p>

<h2>From Inker to Penciler</h2>

<p>I started as an <strong>inker</strong>, helping get artwork into printable form while I learned storytelling. Eventually, I became a <strong>penciler</strong>, drawing the actual drawings and telling stories visually. I wanted to be more than just an artist, I wanted to tell stories.</p>

<h2>Creating Bishop and Learning the Industry</h2>

<p>On the X-books, I was asked to create a character named <strong>Bishop</strong>, which led me into <strong>writing</strong>. When we formed <strong>Image Comics</strong>, I learned about production, retail, distribution, and promotion. I've done everything, from art to retail, and it made me an all-around contributor to the industry.</p>

<h2>Embracing Digital Tools</h2>

<p>I'm proud to be one of the <strong>geekiest of geeks</strong>. In 1989, I bought my first desktop computer to do ray tracing and build models. I wanted to incorporate special effects into my art. When <strong>ZBrush</strong> and <strong>Blender</strong> came along, I jumped into those too.</p>

<p>I use digital tools for <strong>efficiency</strong>. I do all my layouts digitally, working out the anatomy and composition. Then I print the blue lines onto art boards and ink traditionally. This method gives me the freedom to experiment without fear of messing up. If I make a mistake, I can just print out another copy.</p>

<h2>The Importance of Focus in Storytelling</h2>

<p>In comics, we don't always have time to dive into theories like the Rule of Thirds. Instead, I focus on <strong>directing the reader's attention</strong>. For example, if <strong>Cyclops</strong> is the focal point, I'll have other characters' gestures, smoke, or background elements pointing towards him. This way, even in a busy scene, the reader knows where to look.</p>

<h2>My Approach to Cover Art</h2>

<p>My cover process has evolved over the years. Nowadays, I often get assignments without much information about the story. I try to infuse each cover with a <strong>story or emotion</strong> to keep it fresh. Even if the reader doesn't catch the nuances, it keeps me engaged and brings <strong>energy</strong> to the work.</p>

<h2>The Cover I'm Most Proud Of</h2>

<p>One cover I'm particularly proud of is <strong>Storm crying in the rain</strong>. The editor wanted to show a different side of Storm, an emotional side. When I drew it, I was just thinking about her character. But over time, people from various backgrounds have told me how much that image means to them. It resonates with those who feel unseen or who struggle silently.</p>

<p>Knowing that my work has touched people in that way is what <strong>real art</strong> is about.</p>
