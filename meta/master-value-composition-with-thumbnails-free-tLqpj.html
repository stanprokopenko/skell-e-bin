<h2>What's in Premium?</h2>

<p>In this lesson, you'll practice value composition by creating thumbnail sketches from reference photos. You'll simplify images into <strong>three values</strong> in small thumbnails, focusing on capturing the main idea without details. We cover techniques for effective thumbnails, including simplifying, iterating with multiple variations, and experimenting with value groupings. You'll explore using pencils and markers to find what works best for you. There's also a <strong>Level Two</strong> challenge with more complex images, guiding you to refine your sketches further.</p>
