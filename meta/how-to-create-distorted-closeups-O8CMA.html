<h2>Positioning the Viewer</h2>

<p>I’m setting up a <strong>close viewer</strong> on my plan. This placement creates a <strong>wide-angle distortion</strong> because the field of vision spreads beyond the normal 60 degrees. When we stand too close and still want to see the entire object, the edges start to stretch. </p>

<p>I decided to place the viewer so the <strong>front corner</strong> of the object touches the picture plane. I could have shifted the viewer to the left or right, but that often leads to extra distortion on the far side of the object. I also chose how far back to place it on the plan. Being very close is a bit daring, but it shows how the distortion flares out at the edges.</p>

<h2>Locating Vanishing Points</h2>

<p>On the plan, I draw lines from the <strong>viewer</strong> to each <strong>corner</strong> of the shape. These lines mark how the object will appear from that position. The lines tell me the left-and-right placement of those corners in my final drawing.</p>

<p>To find my <strong>vanishing points</strong>, I line up my ruler with the viewer and the edges of the plan that represent the object’s right angles. This setup shows me precisely where the two vanishing points fall on the picture plane. I mark those points so I can drop them straight down later onto my final drawing.</p>

<h2>Dropping Points Down</h2>

<p>Next, I create a <strong>horizon line</strong> on my drawing. I drop down the <strong>vanishing points</strong> from the plan to that horizon. Then, I drop down each important corner from the plan to the base of my drawing. This ensures I have all the horizontal positions matched up. </p>

<p>I start by drawing the <strong>floor base</strong> in perspective. I connect the front corner of the object to the two vanishing points. I make sure the corners line up exactly with their dropped-down positions. Any slight error can throw off the entire perspective.</p>

<h2>Constructing Planes and Slopes</h2>

<p>The object has a <strong>slope</strong> that I measure in plan and then transfer to my drawing. I run lines to the <strong>left</strong> or <strong>right</strong> vanishing points, depending on the edge’s direction. Then I connect these <strong>dot-to-dot</strong> intersections to form the final planes of the object.</p>

<p>I carefully check each <strong>slope</strong> and corner. The closest parts appear larger because of the wide-angle effect. Lines toward the back look smaller, so the object seems to recede faster than usual. This is the hallmark of wide-angle perspective.</p>

<h2>Observing Wide-Angle Distortion</h2>

<p>When you compare this drawing to a more distant perspective, you’ll notice how the <strong>front</strong> of the shape appears <strong>unusually large</strong>, and the slope seems taller than expected. That’s because we pushed our viewer so close, forcing the angles to spread out.</p>

<p>This close-range approach is a chance to study <strong>dramatic foreshortening</strong>. It’s a great exercise for <strong>training your eye</strong> to see how perspective stretches objects at the edges. By setting up these points, lines, and vanishing directions carefully, we can achieve an accurate wide-angle perspective that shows the real distortion of a very close viewpoint.</p>
