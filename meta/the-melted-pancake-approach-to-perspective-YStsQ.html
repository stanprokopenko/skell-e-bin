<p>Hi everyone! I've been thrilled to see the enthusiasm for Phil Dimitriotis' <strong>"melted pancakes" approach</strong>. Over a thousand of you have watched his demos, and the discussions have been fantastic. While I'm hoping Phil can share his thoughts soon, I wanted to address some of the insights and questions that have come up.</p>

<h2>Ernest Watson's Teaching Approach</h2>

<p>One of you shared Ernest Watson's introduction from his book <em>How to Use Creative Perspective</em>. He recounted how, on his first day of art school, students were asked to draw a pile of wooden boxes <strong>without any instruction or perspective theory</strong>. This continued for six weeks, with the instructor only correcting their observations and urging them to <strong>"use [their] eyes more expertly"</strong>. </p>

<p>Initially, Watson thought it would have been better to start with some theory. However, when he began teaching at Pratt Institute, he noticed that while students <strong>mastered the theory</strong>, they still struggled to draw. They lacked the attitude developed through that <strong>six-week grind</strong> of observation without guidance.</p>

<p>There's a term for this method: <strong>"wicked learning"</strong>. It involves placing students in situations where they must solve problems independently, fostering deeper understanding.</p>

<h2>Balancing Theory and Practice</h2>

<p>Reading Watson's account resonated with me deeply. It highlighted the dynamic of how we truly learn: by <strong>trying, failing, and figuring things out</strong>, but also by understanding the underlying theory. <strong>One without the other creates trouble</strong>.</p>

<p>In our course, I've structured the content to reflect this balance:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>First Half</strong>: Understanding how perspective works. Through assignments like the melted pancakes, you're encouraged to <strong>figure things out on your own</strong> and start drawing.</li>

<li><strong>Second Half</strong>: Intensifying the rigor to integrate perspective into both your <strong>brain and hand</strong>. We'll dive deeper into measuring space and forms.</li>

</ul>

<p>I'm intentionally <strong>yin-yanging</strong> these approaches so that each part includes elements of the other. I hope this gives you a clearer sense of our journey together.</p>

<h2>Observations from the Melted Pancakes Project</h2>

<p>The melted pancakes assignment was designed to be fun and accessible. Many of you excelled, but I noticed a common issue: <strong>how the pancakes lay on the ground</strong>.</p>

<p>For example, Johannes provided a wonderful diagram with a responsible receding layout <strong>without dramatic warping</strong>. In contrast, some works had <strong>dramatic warping</strong>, where objects close to the horizon line appeared too open or too thin inconsistently.</p>

<p>Anke's drawings showed pancakes below us that were quite open but became dramatically thin as they receded. This introduces challenges we'll tackle in <strong>Lesson 9</strong>.</p>

<h2>The Importance of Perspective in Drawing</h2>

<p>To enhance the <strong>realism</strong> of your drawings, remember:</p>

<ul>

<li>Objects <strong>closer</strong> to us should appear <strong>more open</strong>.</li>

<li>As objects <strong>recede towards the horizon</strong>, they should become <strong>thinner</strong>.</li>

<li>This helps convey depth and makes it feel like objects are <strong>under our feet</strong> or <strong>further away</strong>.</li>

</ul>

<p>Several of you demonstrated this effectively:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Han</strong> opened up forms beneath our viewpoint, allowing them to thin naturally as they approached the horizon.</li>

<li><strong>Rachel Dawn Owens</strong> illustrated how objects transition from being open to closed, enhancing the sense of depth.</li>

<li><strong>Ethan</strong> went the extra mile by analyzing forms and incorporating the environment with the horizon line.</li>

</ul>

<p>These examples highlight the importance of combining <strong>theory and practice</strong> to achieve convincing perspectives.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p>This melted pancakes project was meant to get you started and, most importantly, <strong>have fun</strong>. I'm proud of the work you've all done. While I hope Phil can provide more feedback, I'll continue to be here to guide and support you. Keep experimenting, keep drawing, and see you soon!</p>
