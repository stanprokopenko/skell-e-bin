<h2>Pre-Mixing Colors</h2>

<p>Pre-mixing colors is a crucial step in my painting process. It <strong>saves time</strong> and ensures <strong>color accuracy</strong>. By having the colors I frequently use pre-mixed, I can focus more on the painting itself rather than constantly mixing new colors. This makes the painting process smoother and more efficient.</p>

<h2>Focus on Light and Shadows</h2>

<p>When painting, I prioritize the <strong>light areas</strong> over the shadows. The main work is where the eye naturally focuses, and shadows are secondary. My teacher taught me that shadows don't significantly affect the form of the light. Spending too much time on shadows is a common mistake, it's essential to focus on the lights first.</p>

<h2>Adjusting and Accenting Shadows</h2>

<p>In the shadows, I adjust the drawing to correct distances, using a mix of black with red for the shadow color. I add <strong>accents in the shadows</strong> to give them depth and keep the painting cohesive. These accents prevent the shadows from looking neglected.</p>

<h2>Recognizability and Details</h2>

<p>Recognizability from a distance is important. I reflect on the "yearbook principle" to ensure the subject is recognizable. <strong>Hairline differences</strong> are crucial for recognition, even more than facial details. I aim to capture qualities reminiscent of the model, knowing it will improve with more work.</p>

<h2>Personal Workflow and Pacing</h2>

<p>My personal work pace varies. Some may finish earlier, but I continue refining. There's no time limit on painting, it's about reaching satisfaction. I sometimes doubt changes made during the process, and double-check. Normally, I'd view the painting from a distance to spot errors, but when tired, I avoid rushing to finish. Taking breaks is important to avoid getting sloppy.</p>

<h2>Techniques for Realism</h2>

<p>To achieve realism, I adjust highlights to create a more natural skin tone. I demonstrate mixing black and alizarin crimson to create a purplish gray, which can add realism by reflecting the skin's natural variations. Using a limited palette ensures harmony in the painting. Adding color variations enhances realism, and I always observe the colors on my skin to guide this process.</p>
