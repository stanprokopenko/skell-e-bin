<p>Hey guys, before we dive into the line category of the course, I want to share a fun exercise to warm up your hand and get you comfortable with drawing <strong>fluid lines</strong>. While doodling with my son, he asked me to draw a <strong>Mario mushroom</strong>, and I realized it's a perfect way to practice <strong>ellipses</strong>.</p>

<h2>Traditional Ellipse Practice</h2>

<p>Typically, artists warm up by drawing random ellipses of various sizes and placements all over the page. This method does warm up your hand and gets the blood flowing, but it lacks <strong>purpose</strong>. You're not challenged to draw the <strong>correct ellipse</strong> in the <strong>right place</strong>, since any ellipse will do.</p>

<h2>The Mario Mushroom Exercise</h2>

<p>Drawing Mario mushrooms adds a fun twist to ellipse practice. This exercise not only warms up your hand but also challenges you to draw specific ellipses that must be placed correctly. The mushroom comprises <strong>eight different ellipses</strong>, each requiring careful placement and pressure control.</p>

<h3>The Eight Ellipses</h3>

<ol>

<li><strong>The Connection</strong>: A long ellipse where the head connects to the body.</li>

<li><strong>The Cap</strong>: The large ellipse forming the mushroom's cap.</li>

<li><strong>The Body</strong>: An ellipse for the body of the mushroom.</li>

<li>&amp; 5. <strong>The Eyes</strong>: Two small ellipses for the eyes.</li>

<li><strong>Center Spot</strong>: The circle in the middle of the cap.</li>

<li>&amp; 8. <strong>Side Spots</strong>: The ellipses on the sides of the cap.</li>

</ol>

<h2>Benefits of the Exercise</h2>

<p>This exercise helps in two key areas:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Pressure Control</strong>: By making certain parts of the ellipse darker where they are visible and lighter where they wrap around, you practice controlling your line pressure.</li>

<li><strong>Placement and Alignment</strong>: Aligning the ellipses correctly on the page enhances your ability to place shapes precisely.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Tips for Effective Practice</h2>

<ul>

<li><strong>Vary Proportions</strong>: Don't aim for a perfect Mario mushroom. Play with proportions to keep it fun and to practice different ellipses.</li>

<li><strong>Visualize Before Drawing</strong>: Imagine each ellipse before putting pencil to paper. <strong>Ghost</strong> the motion in the air to prepare.</li>

<li><strong>Use Your Whole Arm</strong>: Even for small shapes like the eyes, use your whole arm to draw smooth ellipses.</li>

<li><strong>Relax Your Grip</strong>: If your hand starts to hurt, you're gripping the pencil too tightly. Keep a relaxed grip to avoid strain.</li>

<li><strong>Avoid Cleaning Up</strong>: Don't go back over lines to fix or darken them. Focus on executing each ellipse in a single, fluid motion.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Varying the Exercise</h2>

<p>As you fill up the page with mushrooms, change things up:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Change the Angle</strong>: Tilt the mushroom to the left or right.</li>

<li><strong>Adjust the Size</strong>: Draw some big mushrooms and some small ones.</li>

<li><strong>Alter Proportions</strong>: Make some taller, some wider, with larger or smaller caps and bodies.</li>

<li><strong>Experiment with Features</strong>: Change the tilt or size of the eyes, spread them out, or make them bigger.</li>

</ul>

<p>This variety not only makes the page more interesting but also helps you practice a wider range of ellipses.</p>

<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>Practicing ellipses doesn't have to be tedious. By incorporating them into fun drawings like Mario mushrooms, you make the learning process enjoyable and engaging. Don't rush, imagine each ellipse, ghost it in, and then execute the stroke. Keep practicing until you're comfortable, and if you find this challenging, try doing it every day to build <strong>muscle memory</strong>. Go ahead and give it a try, and feel free to share your pages. We'll be starting the line category very soon!</p>
