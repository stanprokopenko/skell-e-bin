<p>In this lesson, I'll be demonstrating how I approach gesture drawing using the <strong>part-to-part</strong> or <strong>shape-based</strong> method. This technique focuses on constructing the figure by connecting individual parts, allowing for a clearer understanding of form, perspective, and foreshortening.</p>

<p>We could just name this gesture approach <strong>Hampton's Dom Riley method</strong>.</p>

<h2>Starting with the Head</h2>

<p>I begin by sketching the <strong>head</strong>, considering its <strong>tilt</strong>, <strong>turn</strong>, and <strong>perspective</strong>. Instead of using an average head shape, I might modify it to better match the model. For example, I might round out the chin or soften certain lines to capture the unique characteristics of the subject.</p>

<h2>Connecting the Neck and Shoulders</h2>

<p>Next, I add the <strong>neck</strong>, thinking about whether it's <strong>stretched</strong> or <strong>pinched</strong> based on the pose. I then define the <strong>shoulders</strong>, which are the top of the ribcage tube. I always try to find my <strong>three</strong> major lines:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>One</strong>: The center line or gesture of the torso.</li>

<li><strong>Two</strong>: The side planes that mimic the body shape, perhaps an hourglass or other modifications.</li>

<li><strong>Three</strong>: The bottom of the ribcage and how it connects to the pelvis.</li>

</ul>

<p>I make sure to overlap the forms appropriately to create a sense of depth and connection.</p>

<h2>Shaping the Torso</h2>

<p>With the torso, I consider the <strong>gesture</strong>, whether it's leaning back, twisting, or bending. I might adjust the shape to reflect the model's body type, perhaps making it more boxy or slimming it down. I ensure that all parts are connected and overlapping properly, and I pay attention to how the neck and head fit with the torso.</p>

<h2>Attaching the Limbs</h2>

<h3>Arms</h3>

<p>When adding the <strong>arms</strong>, I think about their relationship to the torso and how they contribute to the overall gesture. I use shapes like <strong>C-curves</strong> or <strong>S-curves</strong>, and sometimes more angular lines, depending on the pose. For example, if the arm has an <strong>S-curve</strong>, I'll try to capture that flow from the shoulder to the hand.</p>

<p>I might also use the concept of the <strong>axe and handle</strong> for the scapula shape and upper arm, which helps in understanding how the arm moves and connects to the body.</p>

<h3>Legs</h3>

<p>For the <strong>legs</strong>, I identify where they start from the pelvis and decide on the appropriate gesture lines:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>C-curves</strong>: For simple bends or curves.</li>

<li><strong>S-curves</strong>: For dynamic poses with opposing curves.</li>

<li><strong>B-curve</strong>: To capture bulging muscles or specific tensions.</li>

</ul>

<p>I break the legs into upper and lower parts, especially when dealing with foreshortening. I use overlapping shapes and open wrapping lines to convey depth and perspective.</p>

<h2>Foreshortening and Perspective</h2>

<p>The part-to-part approach is particularly helpful for understanding <strong>foreshortening</strong> and <strong>perspective</strong>. By breaking down the figure into connected parts, I can more accurately depict limbs that are coming towards or moving away from the viewer.</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Shorten the lengths</strong> of the parts to convey foreshortening.</li>

<li><strong>Open the wrapping lines</strong> to show which parts are closer or further away.</li>

<li><strong>Overlap shapes</strong> to indicate depth, making sure one part sits explicitly in front of another.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Mindset and Approach</h2>

<p>I find that this method requires a slightly <strong>slower mindset</strong> compared to other gesture drawing approaches. While some techniques feel like you have to be <strong>hyper-caffeinated</strong> to get all those lines down quickly and fluidly, the part-to-part method is more deliberate. It allows me to focus on the connections and perspective, which is especially helpful in complex poses.</p>

<h2>Examples</h2>

<p>Let's go through some examples to see how I apply this method.</p>

<h3>Example 1</h3>

<p>I start with the head, modifying its shape to match the model. Instead of a harsh straight line for the chin, I might soften it. I add the neck and define the shoulders. I consider the gesture of the torso, perhaps shaping it into more of an hourglass.</p>

<p>For the arms, I decide whether to use <strong>C-curves</strong>, <strong>S-curves</strong>, or angular lines based on the pose. I ensure that the arms connect properly to the shoulders and torso.</p>

<p>When drawing the legs, I determine where they start from the pelvis. I might use an <strong>S-curve</strong> for the leg that has a flowing gesture, or an <strong>arrow shape</strong> if it better captures the movement. I break the leg into upper and lower parts, especially if there's foreshortening.</p>

<h3>Example 2</h3>

<p>In this pose, the head is tilted and turned in perspective, looking downward. The neck is stretched, and the shoulders have a tilt. I establish the three major lines of the torso and adjust the shape to reflect the model's body type.</p>

<p>For the legs, I might make one leg a <strong>B-curve</strong> and the other an <strong>S-curve</strong>. I pay attention to the overlaps and how the legs connect to the pelvis. The arms are drawn with rhythms that flow from the shoulders, capturing the movement and connection to the hands.</p>

<h3>Example 3</h3>

<p>This example involves significant foreshortening. I start with the head in a three-quarter view from behind. I add the neck and indicate the tilt of the shoulders. The torso is drawn with overlapping shapes to convey depth.</p>

<p>For the legs, I shorten the lengths and open the wrapping lines. This helps show that the legs are coming towards the viewer. I make sure to overlap shapes, with the parts sitting explicitly in front of others.</p>

<p>The arms are attached carefully, considering perspective. For example, if the forearm is behind the head, I position it accordingly to understand the pose differently.</p>

<h3>Example 4</h3>

<p>In a back view of the figure, I start with the head and neck, pushing them forward in perspective. I define the tilt of the shoulders and outline the three planes of the torso. The legs are drawn with overlapping shapes, showing which parts are in front or behind.</p>

<p>I use the <strong>axe and handle</strong> concept for the shoulders and arms, helping me understand their movement and connection. I consider the ground plane to anchor the figure in space.</p>

<h3>Example 5</h3>

<p>In this pose, the head is tilted down, looking forward. The neck pushes forward, and the shoulders have a particular tilt. I draw the torso with its three major lines and adjust the shape accordingly.</p>

<p>For the legs, I might use an <strong>arrow shape</strong> or pinch shape for one leg and an <strong>S-curve</strong> for the other. I break the legs into parts, especially dealing with foreshortening. The arms are drawn with attention to how they overlap with the head and torso, aiding in understanding the perspective.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p>The part-to-part gesture drawing method allows me to construct the figure in a way that emphasizes connection, perspective, and form. By thinking of how each part attaches to the next, I can better capture the gesture and dynamics of the pose.</p>

<p>This approach is particularly useful when dealing with complex poses, foreshortening, and perspective challenges. It might take a bit to settle into this method, but it aligns with the mindset of doing a longer drawing.</p>

<p>If you've tried these techniques, compare your drawings to the examples. See where you might have done something different or where these suggestions could help you out.</p>
