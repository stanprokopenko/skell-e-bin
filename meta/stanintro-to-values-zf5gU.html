<p>Values are really valuable. <strong>Values are awesome!</strong> If you want your drawings to look three-dimensional and create the illusion of form, you gotta start adding values to your line drawings. Lines are great and they get us really far, but learning how to effectively use values can transform your art. Later, when we combine them with edges, it will feel like magic!</p>

<h2>What Is Value in Art?</h2>

<p>When we talk about <strong>value</strong> in art, we're not referring to its 'worth' or how much money it costs. A value is simply how light or dark something is. If you take a photo and make it grayscale, you see that the skin is lighter than the lips. And even though the color of the lips and the shadows are quite different, their <strong>values</strong> are much more similar—they're both kind of dark.</p>

<h2>Lines vs. Reality</h2>

<p>We've learned a lot about lines. But I hate to break it to you, <strong>lines aren't real!</strong> We don't see lines. As artists, we use lines as a placeholder for the edges of shapes. Lines are a very useful tool for communicating ideas, but they're not what we actually see. They're an abstraction of what we see. What we actually see in reality is light as it affects forms. We see that light as an arrangement of colors. Shapes fill in with colors.</p>

<h2>The Components of Color: Hue, Chroma, and Value</h2>

<p><strong>Color</strong> is made up of <strong>hue</strong>, <strong>chroma</strong>, and <strong>value</strong>.</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Hue</strong> is the family of colors it belongs to—yellow, red, blue, and so on.</li>

<li><strong>Chroma</strong> describes how pure or gray the color is. You can lower the chroma on a blue, and it's still blue, but it's lower in chroma—a little more gray.</li>

<li><strong>Value</strong> describes how light or dark any color is, from white to black. This medium chroma blue might be a value 6, but you can shift it in either direction along the value scale. You can make any color lighter or darker.</li>

</ul>

<p>The relationship between these three properties of color can get complicated, and that's beyond this course. The most important part of color is <strong>value</strong>. It's so important, actually, that artists often categorize it separately.</p>

<h2>The Importance of Values</h2>

<p>Let's imagine that a drawing is like a building. Each individual steel beam is like a line. Put those lines together to make shapes, and you get the steel framework of the building. <strong>Values are like the walls.</strong> They fill in the spaces between the framework, making it solid. Values create the illusion of form, depth, and volume. Beyond that, you have things like texture and color, which are like the decorations in the rooms—wallpaper, furniture. They're details that add to how your art feels.</p>

<p>All these elements are important. You take any one of them out, and you don't really have a building you'd want to live in. But the walls, the floor, the roof—those are really important.</p>

<h2>Starting with Values</h2>

<p>So, as a beginner, it's wise to practice drawing without color. Just practice using <strong>value</strong> to focus on light and form. Once you're comfortable with values, then you can introduce color to add more emotional impact. I know it's really tempting to jump to color. But if you want the time you spend practicing to have the biggest impact, <strong>start with values</strong>.</p>

<h2>The Value Scale</h2>

<h3>The Munsell System</h3>

<p>Now that we understand what value is, let's talk about how we can organize it in a way that's practical for drawing. Imagine a scale from 0 to 10, where 0 is the darkest black and 10 is the brightest white.</p>

<p>This might seem a bit counterintuitive if you think of value as pigment. When we draw, we start with white paper and add darker values with the pencil. But the system we'll be using is the <strong>Munsell system</strong>. It's a traditional way of organizing color and value. Instead of measuring pigment, we're measuring light. When we're drawing, it's not very useful to think of the pigment. It's much more practical to be thinking of the subject we're drawing and how the light affects that subject. A <strong>value of 10</strong> means that area is getting the most light, while a <strong>value of 0</strong> means it's in complete shadow and we can't see anything.</p>

<h3>Working with the Value Scale</h3>

<p>In reality, the value scale is a smooth gradient with an infinite number of values between black and white. But trying to work with infinity is not very practical for drawing and organizing values. That's why artists typically break it down into steps of values, usually about 10. This is more manageable and makes it easier to communicate. If I say "value number 3," you can imagine where that is on the scale.</p>

<p>Maybe you noticed, 0 to 10 is actually 11 total values in the Munsell value scale. Some people squish it to 10 and flip the order. But these numbers are just systems. The most important thing to understand is that there is a gradation from white to black, and you can split that into as many steps as you want.</p>

<h3>Limited Value Scales and Ranges</h3>

<p>You don't always have to use all 10 values in every drawing. Sometimes, you might choose to work with a <strong>limited value scale</strong>. Maybe you decide to use 5 values, just enough to represent the main elements of light and shadow.</p>

<p>You can also play around with different <strong>value ranges</strong> within the scale. Maybe your drawing only uses values from 3 to 8, with no deep shadows or bright highlights. Or you could go for a moody drawing using only darker values from 0 to 5. We'll learn more about value ranges in another lesson and we'll practice with projects.</p>

<p>Our goal is to <strong>train your eye</strong> to see these subtle shifts in value and then translate them into something you can work with on paper.</p>

<h2>Factors That Determine Values</h2>

<p>There are four things that determine the values we see:</p>

<ol>

<li><strong>Light on form</strong></li>

<li><strong>Local value</strong></li>

<li><strong>Surface material</strong></li>

<li><strong>Atmosphere</strong></li>

</ol>

<h3>Focus on Light on Form and Local Value</h3>

<p>For beginners, I highly recommend focusing mostly on those first two: <strong>light on form</strong> and <strong>local value</strong>. The second two are a little bit more advanced, and you should come back to them later.</p>

<p><strong>Local value</strong> is the inherent lightness or darkness of the thing, regardless of the light you shine on it. For example, the value of hair is darker than the value of skin. The local value of something isn't always consistent. An apple might have a lot of variety in its local value and a general gradation from light to dark.</p>

<p>Even though hair is darker than skin, the value of the shadow on skin can be darker than the highlights on hair. That's <strong>light on form</strong>.</p>

<p>You know that when you shine a light on something, it makes it brighter. The value goes up because there's more light. But the value doesn't go up evenly on the entire object. It gets distributed based on the form—where the planes are facing. The part of the object that faces towards the light gets affected the most. But as these planes start to turn away, they get affected by the light less, and so they get darker.</p>

<p><strong>Local value and light on form act together.</strong> If you have two apples hit by the same light, the light side of the red apple is darker than the yellow apple. And it's the same with the shadow sides.</p>

<h3>Surface Material and Atmosphere</h3>

<p><strong>Surface material</strong> is what the object is made of. It could be matte or glossy or highly reflective, and that could greatly change the values that we see even if the light and the form are the same.</p>

<p><strong>Atmosphere</strong> refers to the effect of the air on how we perceive things far away. I mentioned this earlier in the course as <strong>atmospheric perspective</strong>.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p>I hope you are starting to see the <strong>value of values!</strong> There is a lot more to learn, but first I'll give you a simple warm-up exercise and project in the next two videos to get your hands dirty. See you in the next one.</p>
