<h2>What's in Premium?</h2>

<p>In this lesson, I share my process for creating a Spirited Away fan art piece. I cover how I researched Miyazaki's art style, developed initial sketches, and explored ideas to capture the essence of the film. You'll see how I created thumbnails for composition, worked on line art and flat colors, and added lighting and shading to bring depth to the illustration. The lesson details each step I took to finalize the piece, including how I refined the color palette and controlled contrast to guide the viewer's attention.</p>
