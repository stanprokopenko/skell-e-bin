<h2>What's in Premium?</h2>

<p>In this lesson, we explore the fun of thumbnailing and composition techniques. You'll learn how to quickly sketch small compositions to imagine your final image without heavy lifting. We'll focus on directing attention using <strong>one-point</strong> and <strong>two-point perspectives</strong>, and how the <strong>affinity of line</strong> can strengthen your focal point. You'll discover how to consider story and emotion in your thumbnails, and experiment with different perspectives, including <strong>warped perspective</strong>, to create engaging and dynamic compositions. This lesson is all about playing with ideas and figuring out how to tell your story using the concepts you've been studying.</p>
