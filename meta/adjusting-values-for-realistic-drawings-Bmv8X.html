<h2>Adjusting Proportions and Composition</h2>

<h3>Widening the Side of the Head</h3>

<p>Hey everyone! I'm continuing with level two of this cast study. I'm adding more values, finessing the edges, and generally finishing it up by fixing some compositional elements. I've been away from this drawing for a few days, so coming back with a fresh perspective, I noticed that the head felt too narrow. The side of the head needed to come out more. I adjusted the width, bringing it out to give it better proportions.</p>

<h3>Simplifying and Uniting Shapes</h3>

<p>In my composition study, I had intentionally removed certain shapes that I felt cluttered the composition. For example, there was a bottom plane with a shadow that made it look like the background was encroaching into the sculpture. Including that shape made the composition more complex than I wanted. So I decided to simplify by uniting the groups together, ensuring the dark background separates more clearly from the shadows on the figure.</p>

<h2>Expanding My Value Range</h2>

<h3>Allowing More Freedom Within Value Buckets</h3>

<p>At this stage, I'm not as disciplined with limiting my values. While I still keep the values organized in my head, thinking in terms of <strong>deepest accents</strong>, <strong>lighter shadow values</strong>, <strong>reflected lights</strong>, <strong>dark half-tones</strong>, <strong>light half-tones</strong>, and <strong>highlights</strong>, I'm giving myself more freedom within those categories. Not all dark accents are the same value, so having more than five values helps me depict subtle differences.</p>

<h2>Working with Tools and Techniques</h2>

<h3>Using Erasers, Powder, and Shammies</h3>

<p>Even when working with graphite, it's useful to have larger instruments. I'm so used to working quickly with charcoal that when I switch to graphite, I still want to maintain a similar pace. I use my fingers, a <strong>shammy</strong>, and even <strong>charcoal powder</strong> to make big adjustments and soften areas. The shammy can be used to apply or lift graphite, allowing me to adjust values efficiently.</p>

<h3>Darkening Shadows to Enhance Contrast</h3>

<p>I felt that the shadows in my drawing didn't contrast enough with the lights. By darkening the shadows and strengthening the dark accents, especially in the background, I could better judge the darks within the subject. <strong>Darkening areas like the eyes and lips helps to anchor the drawing and create depth.</strong></p>

<h2>Adding Core Shadows for 3D Form</h2>

<h3>Emphasizing Core Shadows</h3>

<p>Core shadows are essential for creating the illusion of three-dimensional form. For example, adding a core shadow along the bridge of the nose immediately makes it feel more spherical and gives it volume. Similarly, identifying and emphasizing core shadows on other facial features helps to model the form and bring the drawing to life.</p>

<h3>Avoiding Overuse of Core Shadows</h3>

<p>While core shadows add depth, overusing them can make the drawing look overworked. It's important to be selective and design the core shadows thoughtfully. <strong>If you put something everywhere, then it's nowhere anymore.</strong></p>

<h2>Balancing Detail in Shadows and Lights</h2>

<h3>Simplifying Shadows</h3>

<p>In the shadows, I prefer to keep things vague, fuzzy, and simplified. I avoid adding too much detail in the shadow areas to maintain a sense of depth and mystery.</p>

<h3>Focusing Detail in the Lights</h3>

<p>In contrast, I focus on adding detail and texture in the <strong>lights</strong>. This approach prevents the drawing from becoming overworked and keeps the viewer's attention where I want it.</p>

<h2>Designing Shapes and Edges</h2>

<h3>Clean, Contained Shapes</h3>

<p>I pay close attention to designing the shapes and edges. I like <strong>clean, contained shapes</strong> and often think about how to simplify complex areas. For example, when dealing with the beard, instead of rendering every strand, I might create a more gestural, flowing shape that feels cohesive and supports the overall design.</p>

<h3>Adjusting Planes and Halftones</h3>

<p>When working on halftones, especially in the lighter areas, I use an <strong>H pencil</strong> because it's harder and allows for finer, lighter marks. Mechanical pencils are also great for halftones because they never get dull and provide consistent line quality. I think about the planes of the face, adding lighter halftones where planes are facing the light and darker halftones where planes turn away.</p>

<h2>Considering Floaters and Simplifying Details</h2>

<h3>Dealing with Floaters</h3>

<p>Sometimes, there are small shapes or highlights, what I call "<strong>floaters</strong>" or "<strong>lakes</strong>", that stand out within the drawing. I have to decide whether to include them, simplify them or remove them altogether. Including too many floaters can make the drawing feel cluttered. However, occasionally leaving one in if it looks good can add interest to the piece.</p>

<h3>Simplifying as Distance Increases</h3>

<p>As I get farther from the focal point, I allow myself to simplify more. I might merge shapes, reduce detail, or let areas fade into the background. This keeps the focus where I want it and prevents the drawing from becoming too busy.</p>

<h2>Stepping Back and Evaluating the Drawing</h2>

<h3>Taking a Break to Gain Perspective</h3>

<p>Throughout the process, it's important to step away and evaluate the drawing. Looking at it upside down can help see it abstractly and identify any issues with composition or values.</p>

<h3>Making Final Adjustments</h3>

<p>I check for any "weird floaters" or areas that feel off and make adjustments as needed. Sometimes, I'll adjust proportions slightly or connect shapes to improve the flow of the drawing.</p>

<h3>Enhancing Highlights and Focal Points</h3>

<p>As I near completion, I focus on cleaning up highlights, reinforcing the focal points, and ensuring that all elements are working together harmoniously. I might add some darker halftones to enhance depth, connect shapes, or adjust proportions slightly.</p>

<h3>Knowing When to Stop</h3>

<p>It's easy to keep going forever, adding more and more details. Eventually, though, it gets easier to convince yourself to stop. When I'm satisfied with how everything looks, when stepping back and squinting at it feels right, that's when I know it's time to call it finished.</p>

<p>Thank you for joining me in this process. I hope this gives you insight into refining a drawing by adding values and adjusting edges. Remember, take your time, enjoy the journey, and I'll see you in the next lesson!</p>
