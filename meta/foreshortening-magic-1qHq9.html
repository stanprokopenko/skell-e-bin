<p>Welcome back! Don't panic, itâ€™s foreshortening week, my favorite way to draw. Why is that? Because there's so much <strong>rhythm</strong> in it. A standard figure can feel stiff, but a rolling, frolicking figure brings joy and dynamism to our work. Foreshortening gives us shorter distances to work with, making it easier to navigate proportions.</p>

<p>There's a lot in foreshortening to be celebrated, and we're going to do that today with some beautiful drawing. We'll end this workshop with flights of fantasy, a big fantasy jam at the end. By now, your pencil will be on fire. So let's explore more wonder in the art and power of drawing through osmosis. Good luck! Let's go!</p>

<h2>Drawing with the Flat of the Pencil</h2>

<p>After all that osmosis, it's time to put it into action. I'm going to draw some of my favorite subjects, foreshortening, followed by some fantasy drawing.</p>

<p>I showed you the underside of the pencil to emphasize using the <strong>flat</strong> of it. I sharpen it in a nice curved manner, and I've got all my fingers and palm on the page. I'm drawing with this pencil, much like I would with a charcoal stick. If you can get used to that, always gliding across the page with your palm and fingers, you'll get as close to the surface as possible. That's why these marks are so <strong>broad</strong>.</p>

<p>Make sure your pencil is well-sharpened. It seems strange, doesn't it, to sharpen your pencil to a point to get a broad stroke? But I want that broad shape from the underside of the pencil. I can tip it up at any point to get a fine line.</p>

<h2>Emphasizing Rhythm Over Proportion</h2>

<p>I'm drawing with <strong>rhythm</strong> here, broad strokes of rhythm. All that osmosis is coming into play, and proportions be damned. We're now playing with shapes that are being shortened and widened as they go back in space. It's wonderful because nobody can call you out and say that proportion is wrong, it's impossible to measure.</p>

<p>I had a student try to measure proportion in a box based on eight heads high and was insistent that it could be done. I never want to curtail anyone trying something new, but I had my doubts, and it was a disaster. They came to me to learn how to draw with rhythm like this, and not only was it a much more pleasurable experience for them, but it also resulted in a much more beautiful drawing.</p>

<p><strong>Accuracy is not the canon for beautiful drawings.</strong> It can be for academia, but not for this. I prefer to have something gestural. Even though I paint figures that appear to be academic, they have so much gesture in them that it almost seems like magic sometimes that I get the perfect reference of the most gestural figure ever.</p>

<h2>Broad Strokes for Mass and Speed</h2>

<p>Working with that broad end of the pencil really frees you up to make beautiful marks. If you haven't noticed already, look how fast this drawing went in compared to a line drawing. Three minutes into this drawing, and we almost have a finished figure with great mass to it. That's what broad strokes do for you.</p>

<p>That's why I work with a big charcoal stick for big paintings and big drawings. And that's why this drawing needed the broad end of my pencil, because it's a small drawing. You might think it's a big drawing if you're used to sketchbooks, but it's small for me because I like to work with my gestural hand and arm. I'm drawing with my arm, and the hand is an extension of that. All of the gestures come from my shoulders.</p>

<h2>Understanding Anatomical Landmarks</h2>

<p>I'm always thinking about those two bounds, the <strong>radius</strong> and the <strong>ulna</strong>, and how they're different in their gesture. The radius is much more angular at the wrist, and the ulna is much more angular at the elbow. There's that beautiful turn as the other hand is established as a broad idea, just getting the bones in there to make it more solid.</p>

<p>Then, finishing as usual: <strong>gesture followed by structure followed by gesture</strong>. The gesture of that long head of the tricep down to the ulna is always a wonder to behold. Remember, we bend the hand more at the ulna than we do at the radius. So I'm pulling that hand in and fanning those fingers like you've seen me do before, just to get that rhythm going.</p>

<h2>Keeping Your Pencil Sharp and Fluid</h2>

<p>You may need a few pencils to get going here, because you're going to use a lot of pencil on broad strokes. Remember, the pencil is getting better and better all the time as a drawing instrument because you're sharpening it. Don't forget to turn it every once in a while, not as you're drawing (might be interesting), but in between. Watch where the words on the pencil are, the description of the pencil, and you should see that move around from time to time during breaks.</p>

<p>As I draw with rhythm, I tend to keep my hand on the surface for as long as possible, continuing that rhythm all the way down. It helps me find the tube pushing into the bell of the hips, and it becomes like a mushroom now. Mushroom shapes are very common to see where overlapping forms meet and fit into each other, sometimes known as <strong>wedging forms</strong>.</p>

<h2>Tackling Complex Foreshortened Poses</h2>

<p>This is a tricky one, because you've got the top of the shoulder showing. So remember those American football player shoulders. I've established the breasts as one unit, the rib cage down to the hips, and then that big <strong>Liberty Bell</strong>.</p>

<p>There's very little sign of <strong>Mr. T</strong> and <strong>Mrs. V</strong> because I'm drawing with rhythm here, rather than construction. The construction is in the rhythm, of course, and I'll re-establish it here as I go around. I feel that rib cage from one side to the other. The idea of <strong>one side to the other</strong> is very important when drawing a foreshortened figure like this. None of it can be a mystery, otherwise, you'll lose your way.</p>

<p>It's very easy to lose your way when there are so many lines, because they're all closer together now. But the great thing about that is, with things being together, it's easier to link one thing to another. You'll need to know the hierarchy there, of course, very well, tenth rib, where the upper abs end, the navel, the ledge, and all that stuff can get very, very close together.</p>

<h2>Visualizing Forms in Three Dimensions</h2>

<p>Think of the hips now as the top of a tube that goes all the way around the body. The foreshortening of the hips means there's very little distance down to the leg insertion. I'm just feeling the edge of that patella there, pushing the leg out more because it felt too short. You get foreshortened legs like this, they always look weird, especially on a female figure. There's so few bones to show, and when the femur and the tibia pull apart, it becomes a big, boxy shape.</p>

<p>That changes the world, but it changes it for the better.</p>

<h2>Embracing the Challenge</h2>

<p>This is a tricky drawing, so if you're following along, just rewind back to the first stages again. Do it four or five times, and then do the next stage. Wherever you feel like you got lost, just go back and start again. Or forge ahead and make notes of what was tricky by the end of it. That'll give you a clearer idea of what you need to strengthen in your subconscious, what you need to put more time into to reinforce that <strong>art engine</strong>.</p>

<h2>Drawing Without Erasing</h2>

<p>Drawing without erasing is a great experiment to begin with, and then it becomes not that anymore, it becomes how you draw. Long gone are the days of that eraser being the constant companion next to me. I can't believe I used to use it so much. It really was detrimental to the art, it told you every time you were making an error, which you weren't.</p>

<p>Every exploratory line should be exactly what it is, <strong>exploration</strong>. I mean, that was a bit nasty, that line going through the breast like that. So it doesn't work every single time, but it's worth doing for the number of times it does work. I would probably get the eraser out for that, if I wanted to show that drawing to someone. Only for that reason, otherwise, I leave it in.</p>

<h2>Confidence and Energy in Drawing</h2>

<p>Take your time over these drawings. These are not things you can rush. Whatever speed you draw at, that's the speed you draw at. If you need to slow this video down to half speed, then do it, and draw along at half speed. But don't rush it. Don't try and compete or keep up with me, that would only compound the errors that would come from that.</p>

<p>I'm indefatigable when it comes to drawing, for the most part, because I'm so energized by it. But when you can't draw very well, it's very easy to do one drawing and say, "I'll do another one tomorrow," because <strong>confidence</strong> has a lot to do with the energy of a drawing.</p>

<p>So take a break and draw again, even if you feel like you did a bad drawing. Just tell yourself that there are no bad drawings and that this is all a big, beautiful experiment with curves and lines. You see, I'm still thinking like that to this day.</p>

<h2>The Subconscious Art Engine</h2>

<p>You're always thinking about the rib cage counterbalancing against the hips. So the rib cage is pulling back, and so are the hips, creating a little beanbag pinch right there. That's why that big S-curve all the way down, itâ€™s kind of a W-curve there, but think of that S. It's a curve that is long and comes in and out all the way through.</p>

<p>You haven't heard me talking about S and C curves, a very common thing to say, and they're everywhere. I like to think of <strong>long, light, loose</strong>. Danny Galieote was one of my inspirations for that, and he drew so well with that method. So for me, it's just the longest line, if you like, and then you curve in and out of it, whatever that curve is, whatever shape that becomes.</p>

<p>But letters of the alphabet are a common play to get things moving, composition-wise. I remember Andrew Loomis did a whole page on composing pictures based on the alphabet, and did a marvelous job of it. So the alphabet, there's something magical about it.</p>

<h2>Tackling Upside-Down Figures</h2>

<p>Here we go with a really foreshortened drawing. So I put the head in first, very unusual, isn't it? But it makes such a big statement. And I put it in first because everything's going to underlap it. So head, shoulders, torso, upper, lower, then the hips as a mermaid's tail, that's a big mnemonic.</p>

<p>So the knees are coming together, and I can do that. You can see the iliac crest there bringing us around. So not only have we got a foreshortened figure, we've got a twisting one. We're seeing the gluteus divide, and then we're seeing the broad of the breasts here as well. So this is a massively challenging puzzle for you to work with.</p>

<p>You may leave this for a bit later, go back to scratch again, back to the earlier drawings, or jump in here and give it a go and see how you feel about it.</p>

<h2>Understanding Gravity and Form</h2>

<p>Think of the breasts like, not so much jelly on a plate, but a hard surface that a fairly stiff, wobbly thing sits on. It's going to take the shape of the rib cage where it peaks most, where it's going to start flattening out at the top of the peak of the breast because of where the breast now lies.</p>

<p>The breast on the right-hand side has fallen away from the body, so it has more curve to it. And there is the one, two, three, bottom of the nose, bottom of the bottom lip, bottom of the chin, to get us that profile stepped on, little steps.</p>

<p>Drawing upside-down figures is incredibly challenging but incredibly rewarding once you start to get them as an idea that you can understand yourself, rather than a puzzle piece that you followed along with and really never understood much of it.</p>

<h2>Building Muscle Memory</h2>

<p>The subconscious art engine, and we can call that now really the motor engine as far as these shapes are concerned, will get you there. And then, as you bring the mnemonics in as an understanding, the hippocampus part is filling those shapes in for you, and that's our internal heart engine.</p>

<p>So two engines at work here, the motor skills of the hand and the arm, and the cognitive skills of the shape-making and committing those shapes to memory. Two things working together, and we're very lucky to have those skills at hand. There's no other beast that has that. You can't get a whale to draw. You can get an elephant, they'll give it a go. They can do such gestural stuff, but they're not going to do mnemonics.</p>

<p>Monkeys give it a go too. It's still the same thing, there's no one like us. No other beast can do what we do. It's that <strong>human element</strong> that's at play here, so much revered and valued because a human did it.</p>

<h2>The Human Element in Art</h2>

<p>AI does do some incredible things, there's no doubt about it. But the second you find out that it's not a human hand, something inside you values it less. And you lose that love of it because you can never go to the artist and say, "That's fantastic," since there is no artist. The prompter was the artist, but still, every line that I'm drawing here, and I'm not disparaging AI artists, I'm just, at this moment in time, seeing what's happening in the world.</p>

<p>If anything, traditional art is becoming more and more valuable for the very reason that there's a rise in AI art. When the airbrush came out, when Photoshop came out, we had a whole host of Japanese artists that would bring out a book every year, and it was about hyperrealism in Japan. We would get that book in our studio and marvel at the skill and finesse of these Japanese artists.</p>

<p>And then Photoshop came out, and the value of photorealistic art just plummeted. Those artists were no longer required for their skills like they used to be. And so, once again, traditional art won out, and that was prized more. People, when they opened Photoshop, were trying to make things more traditional-looking all the time so that they weren't compared to Photoshop, which was machine. And that's still the same today.</p>

<p>They're always trying to bring out traditional brushes, digital ones. And sometimes I see art, and I can't tell if it's traditional or not. And because they're calling them paintings too, it makes it even more tricky. But the proof is in the final thing, where is the canvas? Where is the art on traditional media? And that is truly what is worth the cost of things.</p>

<p>The most expensive object in the world is art, it's that da Vinci painting. If it is da Vinci, that is, there's still a debate over that. Half a billion dollars at the time of this drawing. So art is incredibly valuable not only as a monetary thing, but for me as a thing of beauty and a connection to the soul of all of us. Another human being put their thoughts on paper, canvas, and any other surface, and we can marvel at it forever.</p>

<h2>Practicing and Pushing Your Boundaries</h2>

<p>So drawings, for me, are becoming more and more beautiful to look at. Only an artist can do a drawing like this. I can cobble something together, but there's no doubt an artist did this, and that's the wonder of it.</p>

<p>You get a big space like that where the torso and the arm are far apart, you can shorten that distance with some abstract stuff so it's not so spindly. Or you can leave it and say, "Look how spindly it is," whatever story you're telling. But because this is a nice gestural piece of art, I wanted to close that gap. It just felt right to me. And sometimes it's only that, it felt right.</p>

<p>You don't have to explain your art to anyone. In fact, it is best not to. It almost sounds like an excuse when you explain your art. So I always give a title to art, vague enough for the viewer to do with it what they please. And lots of artists would do that, they wouldn't even put a title on it. They would say <strong>Number 4</strong>, <strong>Number 5</strong>, <strong>Nocturne 1</strong>, <strong>Nocturne 2</strong> for blue paintings, for instance. And that's saying nothing, that's saying there's a color blue in this. Do whatever you like with your imagination to make what you want of it, which is a nice idea.</p>

<h2>Inspiration from Other Artists</h2>

<p>I do like to title my drawings because it helps me to finish them with some kind of idea or emotion, whatever they're doing. <strong>Loss</strong> - anything at all. My favorite themes are <strong>betrayal</strong> and <strong>revenge</strong>, and they work very well to get any drawing started. Pretty dramatic, of course, but they're good themes to work with in fantasy, and it continues its theme into a story. You can create a story out of that, lost love, all that stuff.</p>

<p>You know the Western, "A stranger comes to town." You can build a whole story, and many did, off of that one theme. Well, it's a premise, really. A stranger comes to town. The theme would be revenge, built on that. But look at that, two very simple elements that would create an entire story that captivates.</p>

<p>So I'll bring in some movement into the figure there. This is a test to see what we could do with abstract. So there's me sharpening the pencil. Oh, look at that pencil there, that is a brand new long pencil right there. It's just been sharpened, sharpened with a blade and then finished on a sandpaper block.</p>

<h2>Twisting and Turning the Figure</h2>

<p>And off we go with our brand new pencil. It's going to need a little bit of wearing in, and that's what I'm doing here. So I'm getting down onto the flat again to get that working. And in we go with the tube, a little slim moment here to begin with, and finding the mermaid's tail coming all the way up to meet the pinch. So the <strong>mermaid's tail</strong> is because we're looking at just knees there.</p>

<p>Two heads down for <strong>Mrs. V</strong> right there, head length, that is. And because it's a 2D leg, meaning it's going horizontally, there is no perspective to shorten that. The upper leg is a little bit more in perspective, it's going behind that leg. But it doesn't really matter. Just in your mind, in your subconscious, that's the length of it.</p>

<p>I'm putting the rib cage into that tube, and I'm thinking very hard about twisting this rib cage away from the mermaid's tail to give it a torque, so <strong>asymmetry</strong>. Asymmetry in positions. If that was just a standing figure once again, it would be the dullest thing in the world. But a twisting figure? Well, now there's something. It becomes much more interesting.</p>

<p>What about a foreshortened twisting figure? Wow! You betcha! And what about a foreshortened twisting figure with a head turned? Get out of here! What about with the arms flailing around? Stop it! It's too much. It's too much wonder.</p>

<p>And I love it for all of those reasons. What used to be the most fearsome thing to draw, the foreshortened figure, is now my favorite. I love to see a foreshortened figure in the life draw. I said to my model once, Alana, "Give me the craziest foreshortened pose, challenge me." You should have seen the pose she did. The students gasped. It was like she was possessed. And I asked for it, so I had to draw it. But it was brilliant. It was totally contorted. It was marvelous.</p>

<h2>Working with Models and Poses</h2>

<p>So lucky to have the models I do, they've really made my art better than it could possibly have been with just me alone at the helm.</p>

<p>When you get a good model, give them good prompts, not AI prompts, <strong>actual intelligent prompts</strong>. Tell them, "Here's the theme, here's the emotion that you're feeling within this story, this premise," and let them fly. I give a little sketch, a rough sketch, nothing too detailed, so that they can interpret it. But everything's in the theme: <strong>love lost</strong>, <strong>betrayal</strong>, all of those things are incredible to get a story started.</p>

<p>A dramatic story, that is, because we're emotional creatures, and so we've all been betrayed. We've all thought of revenge and been ashamed, or acted on it. Those things will tumble into all kinds of drama and despair, unchecked. That's the premise and making of great storytelling, <strong>Macbeth</strong>, say no more.</p>

<h2>The Importance of Practice and Mileage</h2>

<p>You'll get better drawings, and they will be much more fluid. Some of them will go wild and out of proportion, but that can be the making of a drawing, finding those beautiful heavy rhythms.</p>

<p>I'm taking the heaviness of that figure in the middle and bringing it over to this one, making it nice and squat. Turn that torso, push this arm out, it's just a tube at the moment. It could be something else soon enough. You can push that forearm into it as a wedge, as you go. The arms can be incredibly long-looking when you pull them out like that, especially when turning them away from the back and pushing the scapula forward.</p>

<p>So if you put your two arms out like the <strong>Vitruvian Man</strong>, then you'll find that generally you're as tall as you are with your arms outstretched if you measured them. My arms are stretched with the chest included. Like the Vitruvian Man, I'm longer in the arms. I'm six feet tall if my arms were legs.</p>

<p>People are different all the time, you get long arms, long legs, short arms, all over the place. The torso is generally pretty much the same on everyone, even though women have longer torsos than men by a small amount. But I see long-torsoed men too.</p>

<p>If we were carbon copies of each other, it would be very dull. I don't know how much interest I'd have in drawing if that was the case. I'd do something more abstract, probably.</p>

<h2>Embracing Your Own Style</h2>

<p>A friend, Des Embry, who I've mentioned before, said to me, "All art's abstract." He's absolutely right. These are lines and marks on a page, they're not real. So obviously it's abstract. So it's a strange term, "abstract art," but we know what it means, you know, it's something wilder than this.</p>

<p>I like to bring a little bit of abstract in. There's all you need for a hand to explain something about what's happening, it's overlapping there. Getting a bit too complicated for a quick sketch, so leave it at that. It's already becoming a spaghetti mess.</p>

<h2>Pushing Your Limits</h2>

<p>I'll <strong>push it till it's broken</strong> - that's a theme of mine - and it broke there, but at least push it there, and then you can pull it back again. I often tell my animation students to do that. They're very careful, and their work isn't as vibrant as it could be if they just pushed it a bit further.</p>

<p>If you want action in a pose, you've really got to push it to its limit. And you'll soon know when it doesn't work, and can pull it back a little bit. Now you have the absolute limit of reality, or the impression of reality that rings true to the viewer but is way beyond what the human person can really do. And yet, it seems possible because of that push. So <strong>push, push, push until it breaks</strong>.</p>

<p>You see Steve Huston pushing those muscles till they break, then pulling back, and sometimes not. So there are no rules.</p>

<h2>The Joy of Drawing</h2>

<p>Once you learn what the muscles are, the anatomy, they become shapes, and then you can just play with those shapes. You don't have to go and get an anatomy book out to see what the teres major looks like. But at the beginning, get your anatomy book out, and just copy the anatomy. Then start drawing some gestural stuff, so that you're not all stuck in that wooden world of copy.</p>

<p>It's a good way to test things, your paper, your pencil, all that stuff, just to copy something from an anatomy book. And you're learning something as you play with the tools, and you're going to use them.</p>

<p>Stick a side view in every once in a while, just to feel that bean shape, the beanbag, and reinforcing that idea that we counterbalance with the rib cage going back to counteract the hips going forward. Love to do that.</p>

<p>That's a very fast sketch there. So that's what the terminology of <strong>quick sketch</strong> really means. It went in fast, but I didn't draw fast, I just drew at my speed. But the accumulation of mileage made it seem so.</p>

<p>None of these are really drawing fast at all. You can see my hesitation, you can see me stop and start about what I want to do next. Is it a straight line? Is it going forward? Is it thick? Draw it in. Is it heavy? Is it light? What kind of broad end of the pencil does it require? Well, underneath, a little bit. Top - not so much. Is there bone in it? A thin line would be good. Let's put that in.</p>

<p>How much gesture can we put in that hand from the knuckle end? Well, a lot. Push it out as far as you like and do half-half. Small hands are very easy to get gestural because you're just thinking of the big stuff. Then you can bring that muscle memory into drawing a longer, bigger drawing with the hands being very detailed. You're bringing the energy of the gesture with you.</p>

<p>So <strong>gesture is king</strong>.</p>

<p>There's a scream every once in a while from students where they say their teacher only does gesture because they don't know how to draw beyond gesture. And for some teachers, there's a truth in that. But often they're teachers because they've proven themselves. They may be teaching you gesture because they think it's important. I certainly think it is.</p>

<p>But I'm not going to shirk my responsibility to render as well, to show you where it all goes, if you consider render the end game, that is. For me, this is an end game in itself. Every drawing is a finished drawing. If the intent is gesture, it's a finished gesture.</p>

<p>**A drawing is finished when the artist stops. ** Remember, you're the boss as well. A lot of young or beginning artists think they're not the boss of it for some reason. Every line you make is your line, every broad shape you put down is your broad shape. There's no one over your shoulder saying, "Do it like this." You're in total charge.</p>

<p>Shall I put a tail on the end of this creature? Of course I will. Who's gonna stop me? Nobody has a tail? Well, if that was the way things were, we'd never have fantasy art. Be careful where you put a tail, by the way. It doesn't come off the top of the sacrum, it comes off below the sacrum. Think about it, the sacrum ends where we used to have a tail. Put a tail there.</p>

<h2>Closing Thoughts</h2>

<p>Once you're drawing and you have to go home, you wish you had more time. I remember leaving the New Masters, thinking I needed more time. All the time spent on the setting up of the shots was time lost on drawing. I was unaware of how much of that was going to happen.</p>

<p>When you're in your studio, you have as much time as you want in your own place. Well, you're used to a different kind of time, <strong>my time</strong>. And that's the same with the life draw class, you know the doors are going to close at 4:30 or 5:00, and that's that. But use it and enjoy it, and <strong>draw, draw, draw</strong>.</p>

<p>There's never been a day of drawing that I've thought, "Well, where did the day go there?"] I could have done something else. There's nothing better. It's the most wonderful thing, well, one of the most wonderful things. It's certainly never a waste. It's always beneficial to your psyche. You know you created something, and you left something behind.</p>

<p>I'm not being judgmental, by the way. There's nothing left behind in scrolling through the internet, other than time has been spent. At the risk of moralizing, just be careful of that time, it's not infinite.</p>

<p>And I do enjoy watching YouTube videos, for instance, just for the joy of it. Give yourself the grace of some downtime as well. Be very careful about wasted time. Remember someone, a philosopher on their deathbed, saying, "How much time I've wasted doing nonsense." And they didn't mean wonderful nonsense like going to a funny play or anything like that, just doing nothing worthwhile. You soon count it all up later.</p>

<p>So here we go with another little drawing in there. Oh boy, I sounded like Sermon on the Hill there, didn't mean to. But I do have a lot of experience behind me, to pass that down.</p>

<p>You can almost see a <strong>flow set</strong> there, do you see that? Almost exactly like the animation flow set, with the two little ears of the set, you can get your shoulders in there if you need to. And wibble-wobbled on to get all that stuff that we've built up with mileage, all those hards and all those softs and all those curves and straights to get what we need.</p>

<p>You saw the rhythm of that forearm go in there. There's nothing more powerful and energetic than a zigzag, a thunderbolt like that. Just leave it. It's very Jeff Watts-y.</p>

<p>Filling in the space on the outside is a compositional idea. It's a nice idea from that school. I'll implement that and make it part of my arsenal of amazing tools to work with.</p>

<p>Move the arm down a little bit there, and try a different angle from it. So you can have very slim arms and wide hips, that's a nice counterbalance of forms. But always the hips. Hips are magical. They're really astonishing how much you can get out of those, two big lumps of gluteus surrounded by a bony mass of structure. It's incredible.</p>

<p>I can't go home, can I? I can't leave this room until I do another one. So in it goes. Once you're drawing and you have to go home, you wish you had more time. I remember leaving the New Masters, thinking I needed more time.</p>

<p>Well, you're used to a different kind of time, my time. And that's the same with the life draw class, you know the doors are going to close at 4:30 or 5:00, and that's that. But use it and enjoy it, and <strong>draw, draw, draw</strong>.</p>
