<h2>Studying Classical Sculpture: Michelangelo's David</h2>

<p>In this section, we're going to study classical sculptures by drawing the ear from Michelangelo's <strong>David</strong>. We'll start by sketching the profile of his ear.</p>

<p>I begin with a light gesture, drawing a horizontal line to indicate the <strong>brow line</strong>, which lines up at the top of the ear. I add a soft vertical line to show where the ear attaches just behind the back of the jaw and the zygomatic arch. Then, I draw a simple <strong>C curve</strong> to block in the line of action of the ear shape.</p>

<p>Using straights, I block in some of the interior shapes, keeping the gesture light. Michelangelo has beautiful thickness variations within the <strong>helix</strong> of the ear, so I pay attention to the small, medium, and large shapes. The helix seems to get larger towards the base as it feeds into the <strong>earlobe</strong>.</p>

<p>I block in the <strong>triangular fossa</strong> and the back of the <strong>antihelix</strong>. For the <strong>tragus</strong>, I like to use a soft egg shape to represent it, and I add the <strong>antitragus</strong> as well. I add some rough value and a soft edge around the earlobe to give it thickness, doing the same on the backside of the helix.</p>

<p>I might indicate some of the surrounding hair clumps and dark accents, but since we're focused on the ear, I won't spend too much time fleshing out the surroundings. I go back and clean up some of the shapes, switching to my textured square brush to add some texture.</p>

<p>To start off with, I add a light value wash, so I don't have to fight the white background. I pull out some of the lights, paying attention to the thicknesses, especially with the helix and antihelix. I make sure to get variations because I don't want everything to be around the same thickness, it would feel very flat and unnatural.</p>

<p>I could keep refining this study for a while, but this gives us a quick study of a classical sculpture. Studying the old masters helps us see how they solved anatomical problems and how they designed the shapes of human anatomy. There's so much to learn from the past.</p>

<h3>Reviewing Ear Anatomy</h3>

<p>Before moving on, let's review the anatomy of the ear:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Helix</strong></li>

<li><strong>Antihelix</strong></li>

<li><strong>Triangular fossa</strong></li>

<li><strong>Tragus</strong></li>

<li><strong>Antitragus</strong></li>

<li><strong>Earlobe</strong></li>

<li><strong>Concha</strong></li>

</ul>

<p>Also, remember that the top of the ear lines up with the <strong>brow line</strong>, and the base of the ear lines up with the <strong>base of the nose</strong>.</p>

<p>When doing the basic gesture, start with a simple <strong>C curve</strong>. For the interior shapes, you have:</p>

<ul>

<li>A big hook</li>

<li>A smaller hook</li>

<li>An even smaller hook on the opposing side</li>

<li>A little triangle for the triangular fossa</li>

</ul>

<p>These basic structures sum up the ear's anatomy and form a good foundation for your drawings.</p>

<h2>Constructing the Ear in Context of the Head</h2>

<p>Next, we'll focus on the basic construction and placement of the ear in the context of the whole head. I like to use the <strong>Loomis method</strong> for this.</p>

<h3>Profile View Ear Placement</h3>

<p>I start with a light sphere to block in the cranium. In the profile view, I find it helpful to add additional thickness to the side where the face is, the <strong>face mask</strong>, so I add another inch for the face. I draw a circle in the middle to indicate where the <strong>temporal ridge</strong> will be. I cut the sphere in half vertically and horizontally, finding the brow line and where the top of the ear will be.</p>

<p>I block in the gesture of the neck and use that simple <strong>C curve</strong> for the ear's gesture. The ear attaches just behind the jaw and the zygomatic arch. The <strong>sternocleidomastoid</strong> muscles latch onto the mastoid process behind the ear.</p>

<p>I note that the top of the ear lines up with the brow line, and the base of the ear lines up with the base of the nose. This is one of the most important things to know, the placement of the ear. If you place it too high, too low, too far back, or too far forward, it will look really weird, and your character may start looking like an alien.</p>

<p>From the profile view, the ear favors the back third of the skull. The portion from the front of the face to where the ear starts is about <strong>two-thirds</strong> of the width, and from where the ear starts to the back of the head is the remaining <strong>third</strong>.</p>

<p>Remember to use the Loomis method, starting with that simple sphere and adding the face mask and side planes.</p>

<h3>Quick Notes on Ear Anatomy</h3>

<p>Let's quickly go over the ear anatomy again:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Helix</strong></li>

<li><strong>Antihelix</strong></li>

<li><strong>Triangular fossa</strong></li>

<li><strong>Tragus</strong></li>

<li><strong>Antitragus</strong></li>

<li><strong>Earlobe</strong></li>

<li><strong>Concha</strong></li>

</ul>

<p>The <strong>sternocleidomastoid</strong> muscle feeds into the mastoid process, which is behind the ear at the base of the cranium.</p>

<h2>Gesture Drawings Focusing on Ear Placement</h2>

<p>Let's move on to some quick gesture drawings to practice ear placement in different views.</p>

<h3>Three-Quarter View Ear Placement</h3>

<p>I start with the Loomis technique, softly blocking in the mass of the cranium. I carve out the side plane of the head, cut the sphere in half to find the brow line, and cut it in half again to find the placement of the top of the ear. I block in the mass of the jaw.</p>

<p>I establish the front vertical <strong>T-line</strong>, which divides all the features in half, helping maintain symmetry. I use wrapping lines to give a sense of perspective and depth.</p>

<p>The ear is placed in the lower left section when you divide the side plane into four. The anterior side of the ear starts just behind the cheekbones and the back of the jaw. The base of the earlobe lines up with the base of the nose, and the top of the ear generally meets up with the top of the eyebrows.</p>

<h3>Front View Ear Placement</h3>

<p>For the front view, I start with a sphere for the cranium and cut it in half horizontally to find the brow line. I cut it in half vertically to find the vertical T-line of the face, which cuts the features in half. I cut off the sides to find the side planes of the face and block in the jaw.</p>

<p>From the front view, I like to do a simple straight line and then a curve that feeds into the base of the earlobe. Note how the base of the earlobe lines up with the base of the nose. From there, I block in some of the interior shapes.</p>

<p>The main things to remember when drawing the ears from the front view are:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Tops of the ears line up with the brow line.</strong></li>

<li><strong>Bases of the ears line up with the base of the nose.</strong></li>

</ul>

<p>Also, the ears shoot off at an angle and then curve back in towards the base of the earlobes.</p>

<h3>Additional Gesture Drawing</h3>

<p>In this last gesture, I start with a simple circle to represent the cranium. I add the face mask in front of the sphere. I find the eye line and use the simple <strong>C curve</strong> for the gesture of the ear.</p>

<p>I block in the features, noting that the top of the ear lines up with the brow line, and the base of the ear lines up with the base of the nose. Remember that the ear favors the backside of the cranium in profile.</p>

<p>When blocking out the ear, I use that simple C shape, then add:</p>

<ul>

<li>A big hook</li>

<li>A smaller hook with a stem</li>

<li>Another smaller hook for the tragus with a smaller stem</li>

</ul>

<p>Again, the key anatomical features are:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Helix</strong></li>

<li><strong>Antihelix</strong></li>

<li><strong>Triangular fossa</strong></li>

<li><strong>Tragus</strong></li>

<li><strong>Antitragus</strong></li>

<li><strong>Earlobe</strong></li>

<li><strong>Concha</strong></li>

</ul>

<h2>Final Notes Before Moving to the Painting</h2>

<p>Learning all this anatomy and structure of the different features will definitely enhance and improve your portraits and character designs. Knowing where the planes are, where to add lighting, cast shadows, core shadows, and where the planar changes are helps a ton when designing characters. It grounds them in reality and gives them a greater sense of believability.</p>

<p>Even when you're doing more cartoony characters, informing those designs with actual anatomy knowledge really enhances the design and makes your artistic decisions more informed.</p>

<p>So, with that said, let's move on to the painting.</p>
