<p>In this lesson, we're going to talk about how hands change with age, from infancy to old age. Hands are complicated with their many articulations and proportions, and this complexity increases when you consider how they change through human development. Let's go over the hands during different stages of development.</p>

<h2>Infant Hands</h2>

<p>Infant hands are <strong>tiny, chubby, and short</strong>. The palm makes up much more of the mass of the hand. The fingers are conical or cone-shaped and taper quite a bit as they move from the palm to the tips. The hand appears more like a squat paddle. The skin is <strong>soft and smooth</strong>, and the knuckles typically have dimples instead of being raised. The fingernails are <strong>small and thin</strong>, making them less noticeable. X-rays of a baby's hands show that the bones are quite separated, indicating significant growth and development to come. As an artist, emphasize the chubbiness, dimples, and softness of infant hands. Break the hand down into simple shapes and avoid sharp angles and bony features.</p>

<h2>Toddler Hands</h2>

<p>In toddlers, the hands are <strong>slightly larger but still chubby</strong>. The fingers start to elongate and are less conical than in infants. The palm is still relatively short, and the hand is wide. The skin remains <strong>smooth</strong>, retaining plenty of baby fat with dimples at the knuckles still visible. There tends to be a bit more separation between the fingers compared to infants. The fingernails are <strong>slightly larger</strong> but still small and thin.</p>

<h2>Small Children Hands (Ages 3-7)</h2>

<p>For small children, ages 3 to 7, the fingers continue to lengthen and lose some of that baby fat. The fingers become more <strong>cylindrical</strong> instead of cone-shaped. The skin is smooth but less dimpled at the knuckles. The fingernails are <strong>larger and more proportionate</strong> with the hand.</p>

<h2>Adolescent Hands (Ages 7-12)</h2>

<p>Adolescent hands, ages 7 to 12, grow rapidly. The hands become longer and more slender, as do the fingers. The fingers are more defined, and the knuckles and bones of the hand become more prominent. The skin is smooth but starts to show more texture around the knuckles. The fingernails are more developed and now resemble <strong>adult fingernails</strong> in their shape and proportion to the rest of the hand.</p>

<h2>Teen Hands (Ages 13-19)</h2>

<p>Teen hands, ages 13 to 19, are basically adult size but can vary widely depending on growth spurts. The fingers are long and slender, the knuckles are well-defined, and the skin starts to show more texture and definition. The fingernails are <strong>fully developed</strong>, strong, and have the same proportion to the hand as adults.</p>

<h2>Adult Hands (Ages 20-60)</h2>

<p>Adult hands, ages 20 to 60, are fully grown. The hands have reached their mature size and shape. The fingers are well-defined. The musculature, tendons, veins, and bony features of the hand are more prominent.</p>

<h2>Elderly Hands (60+)</h2>

<p>In elderly hands, ages 60 and above, the hands may appear slightly shrunken due to loss of muscle mass. The joints and knuckles become more prominent. The skin becomes <strong>wrinkled and thin</strong>. The anatomy of the veins, tendons, and bones becomes more visible and apparent.</p>

<h2>Assignment</h2>

<p>Your assignment for this lesson is to sculpt some baby hands. Stay creative, stay productive, and I'll see you in the next lesson.</p>
