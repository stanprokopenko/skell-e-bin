<p>I want to show you how I set up a <strong>wide angle perspective</strong> for a simple object I often call a “widget.” I’ll walk you through how I find key intersection points, establish the vanishing points, and place a viewer very close to the object to give it an <strong>extreme</strong> look. This approach can feel like a complex crossword puzzle, but it’s a great exercise in spatial awareness.</p>

<h2>Setting Up the Scene</h2>

<p>I start by placing <strong>top</strong>, <strong>front</strong>, and <strong>side</strong> views (orthos) of the object. I use these to figure out the height of important features when they touch the picture plane.</p>

<p>I mark the <strong>base</strong>, the <strong>transition line</strong> where a slope meets a flat plane, and the <strong>highest point</strong> of the widget on the picture plane. </p>

<p>Then I decide how close the viewer should be. If the viewer’s point is too close, the effect becomes very distorted. If it’s too far, I don’t get that wide angle I’m aiming for. I find a middle ground that still gives a strong convergence in perspective.</p>

<h2>Finding the Vanishing Points</h2>

<p>I draw lines from the viewer’s point to key corners of the object:

- One set of lines defines the <strong>right vanishing point</strong>.<br />

- The perpendicular set defines the <strong>left vanishing point</strong>.</p>

<p>Both vanishing points end up fairly close together, which adds to the super wide angle look. </p>

<h2>Projecting the Corners</h2>

<p>I connect the <strong>far left</strong> and <strong>far right</strong> corners of the object back to the viewer on my diagram, then note where these lines intersect the picture plane. These intersections become the object’s corners when I drop them vertically. I’m careful to keep lines straight and consistent either to the vanishing points or vertically down.</p>

<p>I also place the <strong>horizon line</strong> very high, aiming for a severe <strong>downward</strong> viewpoint.</p>

<h2>Constructing Heights and Slopes</h2>

<p>Next, I identify the height lines by projecting them back to the correct vanishing point. Where these lines meet the back edges determines the <strong>upper</strong> and <strong>lower</strong> shapes of the object.</p>

<p>For the <strong>sloped</strong> part of the widget:

1. I track the slope and where it intersects the front and back edges.<br />

2. I connect those slope corners to the vanishing points.<br />

3. I drop any verticals needed to see where they fit into the final shape.</p>

<p>I double-check how close lines meet and where they converge. Minor variations are normal. </p>

<h2>Finishing the Drawing</h2>

<p>After the slope is in place, I finish the <strong>plateau</strong> on top of the widget:

- I project a horizontal line from the slope’s highest point.

- I connect it back to the left and right vanishing points.

- I confirm all intersections match up to complete the final shape.</p>

<p>The result looks stretched and warped. The <strong>front corner</strong> juts toward the viewer, creating acute angles where I’d normally expect obtuse ones in a standard two-point setup. The deep sense of space comes from the viewer being so close.</p>

<p>This sort of extreme wide angle perspective is <strong>fun</strong> and reveals how perspective can become <strong>distorted</strong> when the viewer is placed near the subject. It also trains me to track multiple lines, keep intersections organized, and appreciate how a <strong>simple shape</strong> can turn into something wild in a drawn perspective.</p>

<p>I encourage you to <strong>try</strong> placing a viewer very close to your own object and building an exaggerated two-point perspective. Yes, it’s a bit of a puzzle, but it’s a valuable exercise in understanding and controlling your drawing’s sense of depth. Good luck!</p>
