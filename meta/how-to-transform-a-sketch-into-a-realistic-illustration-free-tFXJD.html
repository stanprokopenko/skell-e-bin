<h2>What's in Premium?</h2>

<p>In this lesson, we'll take a thumbnail sketch of <strong>The Thing</strong> and develop it into a finalized drawing ready for painting. You'll see how to set up reference material by incorporating photos of a model and rock textures to enhance authenticity. We'll adjust the canvas, refine the silhouette, and focus on the big shapes before adding texture and details. By blending anatomy with rock formations, we'll create a believable version of The Thing that serves as a strong foundation for the final painting.</p>
