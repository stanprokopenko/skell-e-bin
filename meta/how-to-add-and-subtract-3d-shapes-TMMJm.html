<p>I'm gonna do the memory game, drawing from memory. I'm drawing a whistle. Before that, I'll show how to add and subtract 3D primitives. Many objects are built from basic volumes combined. Organic things are harder to fit into primitives but still can be. For example, a camera is a box with a cylinder for the lens. A pen is a cylinder with various boxy and cylindrical parts. Sometimes you need to subtract one shape from another. I'll show how to do that.</p>

<h2>Adding 3D Primitives</h2>

<p>Let's start with a box and add an elongated cylinder on top. Here's how to do it:</p>

<ol>

<li><strong>Draw an ellipse lightly</strong> to get a decent shape.</li>

<li><strong>Carry it over to the other side</strong> and draw a similar ellipse.</li>

<li><strong>Darken the lines</strong> to indicate the outer form.</li>

<li><strong>Erase construction lines</strong> to clarify the final drawing.</li>

</ol>

<p>Now it looks like a box with a rounded part on top. This shows how to build complex things from simple shapes.</p>

<h2>Subtracting 3D Primitives</h2>

<p>Now let's do subtraction. Start light and rotate the sketch pad. Here's the process:</p>

<ol>

<li><strong>Draw another box</strong> and subtract a shape from the bottom.</li>

<li><strong>Draw an oval at a different angle</strong> and carry it over to the other side.</li>

<li><strong>Darken lines</strong> to subtract the shape, creating a valley.</li>

</ol>

<p>Think of the entire volume when subtracting.</p>

<h2>Drawing a Whistle from Memory</h2>

<p>Now, let's try the whistle. I'll stare at it, memorize, and then draw from memory. In class, we did figure drawings from memory, looking for a minute and drawing for 3-5 minutes. Here's the process:</p>

<ol>

<li><strong>Identify basic volumes</strong>: the body is a cylinder, and the mouthpiece is a tapering box.</li>

<li><strong>Note the subtraction</strong> at the top, a little forward.</li>

<li><strong>Hide the whistle</strong> and start drawing.</li>

<li><strong>Start with the top angle</strong> of the box, then taper it.</li>

<li><strong>Add the cylinder</strong>, drawing a square and an ellipse.</li>

<li><strong>Darken lines</strong> to define the shape.</li>

<li><strong>Add the little notch</strong> at the top, drawing a smaller oval.</li>

<li><strong>Use construction lines</strong> to get the cutout right.</li>

<li><strong>Add thickness and details</strong>.</li>

<li><strong>Compare with the reference image</strong>.</li>

</ol>

<p>The angle was off, but the whistle looks similar. This exercise improves visual memory and helps in constructing shapes.</p>

<h2>Benefits of the Exercise</h2>

<ul>

<li><strong>Improvement of visual memory</strong>.</li>

<li><strong>Enhancement of skills in constructing shapes</strong>.</li>

</ul>
