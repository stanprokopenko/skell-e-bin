<h2>Setting Up the Painting</h2>

<p>I always start by deciding on the overall temperature of the light source. For this piece, I chose a <strong>warm and inviting orange</strong>. To create contrast, I selected blue as the opposite color for shadows. I then split the colors, using two colors in light and two in shadow. This approach helps me avoid being overwhelmed by too many color choices.</p>

<p>To begin, I generated a line drawing in Photoshop using the Find Edges filter. I adjusted it using Levels and desaturation, then cleaned it up manually. I set the line drawing layer to Multiply blend mode and locked it.</p>

<p>For my palette, I chose a split complementary scheme:</p>

<ul>

<li>Orange and green for light</li>

<li>Purple and blue for shadow</li>

</ul>

<p>I laid down these four main palette colors at the bottom of my canvas for easy reference.</p>

<h2>Laying the Foundation</h2>

<p>I started with a cool blue background to contrast with the warm light. For the water, I used a saturated blue. Then, I laid in the local colors - green for the monster, peach for the girl's skin, and so on. For the whites of the eyes, I used blue tints. At this stage, I removed all white from the canvas.</p>

<p>Next, I created a new Multiply layer for shadows. I used desaturated blue and purple, switching between them to introduce both shadow colors. To anchor the monster on the water, I added a cast shadow. I also darkened the background to make the monster pop.</p>

<h2>Building Color and Form</h2>

<p>To add warm light, I used the Overlay blend mode with orange. I hid the line drawing at this point to focus on light effects. To maintain the monster's color, I introduced green light as well. I carried these colors throughout the painting for cohesion and harmony.</p>

<p>I darkened the background with purple to make shadowed areas pop, then flattened the shadow layer onto the background. In the crevices, I added ambient occlusion and built blue ambient light into the monster's face.</p>

<h3>Addressing Value and Contrast</h3>

<p>I realized I had a value problem - the monster was blending into the background. To fix this, I used deep purple to ensure the monster reads light over dark. <strong>Value contrast</strong> (light over dark or vice versa) is key for clarity, independent of color.</p>

<p>To add vibrancy, I sampled and increased the saturation of blues, particularly in areas exposed to the environment. I demonstrated how a saturation scale from gray to full saturation expands color possibilities without needing many hues.</p>

<h2>Detailing and Refinement</h2>

<p>I added subtle anatomical structure to the monster's head for eye sockets and began detailing the child character with basic features and limbs. I applied a bluish skylight pass to the child's upper brow for consistency with the monster.</p>

<p>For the monster's fur, I used the smudge tool with texture to create diffuse edges. I focused on the monster's belly as an important focal area, adding a variety of color temperatures. I demonstrated rendering fur texture, especially at silhouettes, and showed how to suggest fur texture in shadow areas.</p>

<h3>Working with Color Temperature</h3>

<p>I used warmer colors in areas not facing the sky, then cooled them with blue as needed. I explored color temperature relationships using blues, greens, and oranges. It's important to work with color temperature paths rather than individual colors.</p>

<p>For ambient light (also called reflected light, bounce light, or diffuse light), I used desaturated blue. I added occlusion to the child's eyes to suggest eye sockets and used a multiply brush for shadow passes on the girl's dress and to carve out the monster's form.</p>

<h2>Advanced Techniques and Final Touches</h2>

<p>I gradually darkened and warmed colors as they turned away from the light source. I varied highlight placement based on the light source and environment reflections. To balance cool tones, I scumbled in warmer hues.</p>

<p>I used the smudge tool for edge work and blending, which is great for creating soft edges when blending between colors. For lighting effects, I added "god rays" or light beams with a soft airbrush.</p>

<p>I fixed logistical issues like intersecting elements and added shadows and occlusion where objects met. For the book pages, I used a multiply brush to add abstract text.</p>

<h3>Finishing the Painting</h3>

<p>To know when I was finished, I tweaked smaller shapes and fully dispersed palette colors. I took breaks and got outside opinions to assess completion. I added final color temperature variations and saturated notes, and carved out shapes with background color where needed.</p>

<p>For reflections, I used an overlay brush with varied colors and added subtle color shifts in the water. As a final magical touch, I added glow effects.</p>

<h2>Key Principles and Tips</h2>

<ul>

<li>Work with a <strong>limited palette</strong> to avoid being overwhelmed.</li>

<li><strong>Value contrast</strong> is crucial for clarity, independent of color.</li>

<li>Balance warm and cool tones throughout the painting.</li>

<li>Carry palette colors throughout the painting for cohesion.</li>

<li>Take breaks and get outside perspectives to assess your work.</li>

<li>Don't be afraid to paint over mistakes - it can create interesting unexpected relationships.</li>

<li>Ensure no area of the painting lags too far behind others in development.</li>

<li>Use canvas flipping to check and improve form clarity.</li>

</ul>

<p>Remember, digital painting is a process of constant refinement and problem-solving. Don't be afraid to experiment and trust your artistic instincts!</p>
