<h2>Building on Fundamental Skills</h2>

<p>In <strong>Part One</strong>, we covered the fundamentals and technical aspects of digital painting. Now, in <strong>Part Two</strong>, we'll take those fundamentals further to learn <strong>advanced techniques</strong> and create <strong>high-level illustrations</strong>.</p>

<h2>Learning from Professional Artists</h2>

<p>We're excited to introduce even more instructors who will share their <strong>workflows</strong>, <strong>painting techniques</strong>, <strong>art styles</strong>, and unique approaches to achieving the right look in their professional fields.</p>

<p><strong>Artists like Bryce Koh and David Greco</strong> will teach you different aspects of <strong>concepting in the gaming industry</strong>. <strong>Tiffany Meng and Jeremy Vickery</strong> will show you in-depth <strong>color grading processes</strong> they used when working on shows like <em>Marvel's What If</em> and <em>Fallout</em>. <strong>Ben Ebelin</strong> will cover how he creates <strong>stylized digital portraits</strong> in record time.</p>

<p>We'll also branch out into more programs like <strong>Procreate</strong> and <strong>Webby Paint</strong>, but most importantly, we'll focus on making finished pieces at an <strong>industry-standard level</strong>.</p>

<h2>The Importance of Speed and Quality</h2>

<p>Speed is important when working professionally. Artists need to work fast enough to output a regular flow of art but also maintain a quality that's high enough for the job. In this course, you'll see what's important to focus on and learn tricks you can use to <strong>speed up your workflow</strong>.</p>

<p>Whether you want to do digital art professionally or just for fun, these skills will help you reach the next level, if you take the time to practice from these lessons.</p>

<h2>Applying Fundamentals and Exploring Style</h2>

<p>There will be <strong>no assignments</strong> in this section of the course. We're not teaching fundamentals anymore. Now it's all about <strong>applying those fundamentals</strong> you've learned to finished pieces and <strong>playing with style</strong>.</p>

<p>Watching how professional artists work will help a lot. You can <strong>follow along with each artist</strong>, and we recommend doing an illustration of your own using each artist's approach. You might find some new techniques that you can apply to all your future projects, but you won't really learn them unless you <strong>try them out in practice</strong>.</p>

<p>You may even combine and synthesize several artists' techniques and styles to create a new style of your own. Try them out, post your work, and share them with the community.</p>

<h2>Upcoming Lessons</h2>

<p>Coming up first, <strong>Bryce Koh</strong> will be taking us into the world of <strong>video games</strong>. Bryce was the sole concept artist and illustrator for the game <strong>Sea of Stars</strong>.</p>

<p>See you soon!</p>
