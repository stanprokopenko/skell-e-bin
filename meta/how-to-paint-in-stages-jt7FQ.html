<h2>Emotional Aspects of Art Creation</h2>

<p>Creating art brings a <strong>sense of calm</strong> and boosts my confidence, especially when I start with a drawing that feels right. Even after over 40 years as an artist, I still experience <strong>nervousness</strong> about my demos not working out. This anxiety can stem from choosing the wrong model or not being mentally present. In tough times, I remind myself to "draw, Morgan, draw," which helps me focus and solve problems. Nervousness can lead to unnecessary details, so I concentrate on the drawing itself. Starting with a solid drawing foundation brings calmness and reduces the fear of losing control.</p>

<h2>Methodical Approach to Painting</h2>

<p>My studio can get hot, and I find myself sweating, but I remain calm because my <strong>methodical system</strong> is working. Following a system in stages reduces anxiety and avoids what I call "tightrope painting." Teaching beginners with a calm, staged approach prevents fear and hatred of painting. This method involves not moving forward until each stage is satisfactory. Although it may take longer initially, it makes logical sense and provides a predictable and manageable process.</p>

<h2>Practical Techniques in Painting</h2>

<p>I enjoy watching Ethan Becker videos, though I'm not a social media star. I spent most of my day preparing for this session, starting late at night. <strong>Pre-mixed dark colors</strong> from yesterday are handy for the current lighting situation. I add a little red to the ear area for warmth, drawing with paint for accuracy. Using a number two brush feels like drawing with a pencil, enhancing accuracy. The current photo is more complex due to reflected light and the subject being a girl. Larger brushes help cover ground quickly in less precise areas. I'm running low on larger brushes and need to order more. Using a rare mongoose brush, which is now illegal, adds a unique element to the process. <strong>Squinting</strong> helps decide what details to omit, making painting less burdensome. Painting can be unenjoyable under tight deadlines, but squinting aids decision-making.</p>

<h2>Teaching Philosophy and Experience</h2>

<p>My teacher used to say, "If you're having fun, you're doing it wrong," emphasizing hard work. Serious effort in drawing often doesn't involve smiling, but it shows in the work. I hope viewers find the method simple, as it shouldn't be difficult if followed correctly. The method involves setting up stages, making the process predictable and manageable. I used to paint from a blank canvas for demos, but it's not useful for teaching. Demonstrating skill in front of an audience is different from teaching students. The method I'm showing is more useful for students, breaking down painting into stages.</p>

<h2>Personal Insights and Reflections</h2>

<p>I accidentally started painting the hat, but I'll return to focusing on the darks. Using a mongoose brush again after years, I find it floppy compared to my usual brushes. The photo chosen has many details, which might be too much for a beginner course. I plan to focus on the head and not turn this into a gallery piece yet. I aim to achieve the desired effect early, cleaning the painting to guide further work. Balancing art creation with teaching is a continuous journey, and I look forward to future focus and goals in painting.</p>
