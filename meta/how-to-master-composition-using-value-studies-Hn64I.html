<p>In this session, we're diving into simplifying values in master paintings to study their compositions. The assignment was to take master paintings and reduce their values to just two or three, <strong>light and dark</strong> or <strong>light, mid, and dark</strong>. Level two involved setting up your own still life and doing the same.</p>

<h2>Importance of Simplifying Shapes and Values</h2>

<p>When simplifying, it's crucial to focus on big areas and abstract shapes, not getting bogged down in details. Think of the <strong>big idea first</strong> before refining. Start with small thumbnails to figure out the overall composition, then you can work slightly larger to include more details if necessary.</p>

<h2>Techniques for Analyzing Values</h2>

<p>One effective method is to <strong>squint at the painting</strong>. This helps you see the big shapes and how values are grouped. Look for large masses of light and dark rather than individual spots of value. For example, in Sorolla's painting with the cow and figures, squinting reveals a <strong>big dark shape mostly in the middle of the canvas</strong>, surrounded by lighter mid-tones in the sky and water.</p>

<h3>Using Gradient Maps</h3>

<p>I often use gradient maps to analyze values, especially when working digitally. This tool allows you to adjust thresholds to see how different areas of the painting group into light, mid, or dark values. It's a quick way to experiment and understand the value structure.</p>

<h2>Color vs. Value</h2>

<p>Remember that color has three properties: <strong>hue, saturation, and value</strong>. When translating from color to grayscale, we lose information conveyed by hue and saturation. Bright colors can have the same value as dull colors but look very different. To capture the intent of the original painting, we might need to <strong>shift some values around</strong> in our simplification to compensate for the loss of color information.</p>

<h2>Avoiding Common Pitfalls</h2>

<p>Many artists, including some of you, get caught up in <strong>too many details</strong>. It's tempting because details can be fun, but the goal here is to <strong>capture the overall value composition</strong>. Try flipping the reference image upside down to help focus on shapes and values rather than recognizable objects. This can reduce the temptation to draw what you think you see instead of what's actually there.</p>

<h3>Tool Selection Matters</h3>

<p>Using the right tools is important. For instance, working with a 0.5 mechanical pencil can limit your ability to achieve a full range of values. Make sure you have materials that allow you to represent darks, mids, and lights effectively.</p>

<h2>Interpreting Thresholds and Value Grouping</h2>

<p>When grouping values, consider how the <strong>thresholds between light, mid, and dark values</strong> affect the composition. The values you choose for each group can significantly change the emphasis and mood of the piece. For example, in a dark overall painting, the mid-value might be much closer to the darks, emphasizing the few light areas even more.</p>

<h3>Maintaining Context and Intent</h3>

<p>Be mindful of which elements are crucial for conveying the story or focal point. Sometimes it's necessary to adjust value groupings to maintain context. For instance, merging mid-values with lights or darks based on what's more important for the composition. Always consider what shapes might be lost or gained with each grouping decision.</p>

<h2>Specific Painting Examples</h2>

<h3>Sorolla's Painting</h3>

<p>When simplifying Sorolla's painting, focus on the <strong>big dark shape in the middle</strong> and consider how the sail might need to be adjusted in value to capture its prominence in the original.</p>

<h3>Rockwell's Illustration</h3>

<p>In Rockwell's work, pay attention to the <strong>focal point of the face</strong>. Ensure that the value simplification emphasizes the face by correctly grouping the lights and darks.</p>

<h3>Sargent's Painting</h3>

<p>For Sargent's painting with the woman in the white dress, be careful with the values of the chair and background. The dress should pop forward, so the chair might need to be grouped with the mid-values or darks to maintain that effect.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p>Simplifying values in master paintings is a challenging but rewarding exercise. It forces you to think critically about composition, value grouping, and the overall mood of the piece. Remember to <strong>stay focused</strong>, avoid getting lost in details, and always consider the <strong>big picture</strong>. Through practice, you'll develop a better understanding of how master artists compose their works and how you can apply these principles to your own art.</p>
