<p>My name is Dave Greco. I've been a concept artist in the game industry for about 23 years. Right now, I'm a senior character concept artist for the <strong>World of Warcraft</strong> team at Blizzard. Today, I want to show you my process when I have to do illustrative work. I'll be walking you through a piece I did for <strong>Magic: The Gathering</strong> for Wizards of the Coast, showing how I go from the thumbnail stage all the way to the final piece.</p>

<h2>Starting with Thumbnails</h2>

<p>I usually start by submitting a bunch of thumbnails that work for the ratio and read well. I try to find the piece I'm looking for in <strong>three to four thumbnails</strong>, and in my experience, the art director is usually happy with that number. For this piece, the final thumbnail was approved, and I stretched it out into the canvas size I wanted to work on.</p>

<p>This was a pretty complicated piece with a lot of moving parts. There was a big description, including a crowd of people in the background, a lot of effects, and a lot of story being told.</p>

<h2>Developing the Sketch</h2>

<p>I began with a <strong>real loose sketch</strong>, it's usually kind of terrifying because it's a total mess. Most artists might think, "I don't think I can do this." But I start by <strong>getting my hand moving</strong>, sketching, painting, and figuring things out as I go.</p>

<p>I airbrushed and started knocking everything away, and then went in with a <strong>cleaner line drawing</strong> to figure out all the moving parts. I wasn't worrying too much about the exact anatomy or how it would be rendered at this early stage. It just felt a little bit closer to where I wanted to get to.</p>

<h2>Working in Layers</h2>

<p>I layered elements to help me figure out the moving parts, even if I didn't know the full colors of the piece yet. For the character in the front, I copied and pasted her from previous layers, trying to find a pose, even if her hands weren't right or her clothing design wasn't final. I knew I could <strong>move her around and figure it out</strong>.</p>

<p>I had a layer set for just a <strong>block out of people</strong> in the background. I'm just trying to do it in small steps and figure it out as I go.</p>

<h2>Getting Approval Before Rendering</h2>

<p>At Blizzard, I have to send my work over in a ton of stages. I don't want to spend a lot of time figuring something out if the art director or art lead is going to completely change or not want something. So even if I have a rough layout like this, I'll send it over and ask, "Is this layout fine? Are all the people where they need to be?" before I spend any time rendering.</p>

<p><strong>You don't want to waste time rendering anything if they didn't even want it to begin with.</strong></p>

<h2>Adding Effects and Flow</h2>

<p>I knew there were going to be a lot of effects, and I didn't want to spend time figuring out their visuals just yet. So I made a layer, blocked them in, and tried to find some type of <strong>movement with the piece</strong> that might add to it. I think about <strong>where you look in the piece, how you move around, how the flow is working</strong>. That needs to work really well. Since I was working on my own layer, I could grab a messy brush and just blast it all over the place.</p>

<h2>Beginning the Render</h2>

<p>Once I got approval, I started on the render itself. A lot of things weren't figured out, which is fine. I hadn't figured out the hands yet. I <strong>shoot a ton of hand reference myself</strong>, my phone is completely flooded with photos of my own hands. It's super important for me to get those right.</p>

<p>I'm just trying to figure out cool, unique shapes that I like. I'm not worried about the final lighting at this point. Even with the character, I didn't exactly know how I wanted to do the hands, I'll figure it out later.</p>

<h2>Working on the Entire Piece</h2>

<p>I'm still trying to work on the <strong>entire piece at the same time</strong>. They always say that's the best thing to do. You don't want to just work from left to right. I'm always trying to <strong>balance everything as I go</strong>. Because this was based on an existing IP, these characters are actually well known. One of the biggest things, especially from my previous years at Blizzard, is how important that IP is.</p>

<h2>Importance of Reference</h2>

<p>Sometimes I have to juggle different styles in my work. I work in small stages, slowly <strong>punching up some color</strong> and <strong>blocking in the hands</strong>, making sure I get them right. I remember trying to find a lot of reference of the anatomy of where the bicep is connected. Sometimes it's hard to find reference for direct angles, but I'm always shooting reference for myself.</p>

<p><strong>If something feels weird, try not to make it up.</strong> ** If you can shoot reference or find reference, spend the time to do it. Especially if you're looking for any studio work, it's almost just as bad if an art director or recruiter sees your work and they know you didn't go find a reference, it seems like you didn't want to put the extra effort in.</p>

<p>I've looked at a lot of portfolios, and I usually ask them, "Did you find a reference for this part? Did you look to see if this anatomy made sense?" Most of the time they say no. So <strong>spend the time, find the reference</strong>.</p>

<p>I've always had this story in my head about John Singer Sargent and how he would scrape off a hand or a finger like ten-plus times till it felt right. <strong>If something doesn't feel right, keep coming back to it</strong>. You'll find a spot where it does feel good. Just don't ignore it and keep going.</p>

<h2>Refining the Piece</h2>

<p>Like most pieces, I keep tweaking. I start visually going around the piece, thinking about <strong>what reads and what doesn't read</strong>. Not just the figure against the background, but is part of the hand not reading well? Is part of the chest or his other hand? I'm trying to figure out <strong>nice shape design</strong> that exists between everything.</p>

<p>I'm talking about what it feels like even in small areas where you can find interesting <strong>negative space</strong> that exists between everything. I'm making sure there are no crazy tangents, even though his finger is touching his shoulder right there. I'm really digging in on what's making it read and not, and I go from top to bottom.</p>

<p>This part of the painting is always my favorite time to paint. You're past that panic stage, where you're questioning your entire decision to have a career as an artist. You have no idea what you're going to paint, and now you feel like the pieces are sliding in, and you can have more fun rendering, which is usually the best place to be.</p>

<h2>Portraying the Transformation</h2>

<p>A lot of this piece was about him turning from a <strong>statue back into human form</strong>. I was really trying to think of something that might show the <strong>dissolve and rock pieces breaking off</strong>. And she's doing it by accident.</p>

<p>I started to add a little bit towards the edge. I didn't want it to feel like just a grayscale version of the human form. Especially since a lot of these have to <strong>read small</strong>, it felt better to make it feel more like a <strong>rock slab or structure</strong>. That helps it read a little bit better as stone.</p>

<h2>Adding Effects Carefully</h2>

<p>I knew I still had to get the effects on. This definitely has to go on its own layer set because this is something that could completely <strong>destroy the entire piece</strong>. So I started off with a really loose brush. I don't know about most people, but I use like <strong>three brushes my whole life</strong>. I have a brush I used like crazy on my YouTube channel, and I pretty much just use that still.</p>

<p>I tried to <strong>brush that all out</strong> and find little parts that make it pop. This is dangerous territory too because you can definitely overdo it and lose focus of the entire piece. But like anything I paint, it's just like <strong>working on one small piece before you get to the next one</strong>. Because like any painting, especially one from an art director, you can get really overwhelmed. I think a lot of people get overwhelmed. If you can just <strong>start with the small pieces</strong>, it helps.</p>

<h2>Final Touches</h2>

<p>Then I started really getting in, even if it's just like an overlay layer or two, just to <strong>make some of the colors pop</strong>. I got it to a layer where I would mostly call it done. You could keep rendering this thing like crazy if you wanted to, but I think like most artists, you have to determine it's <strong>not worth it anymore to keep rendering</strong>.</p>

<p>But like any piece I work on in the studio or for freelance, I always do a <strong>curves adjustment</strong> at the end. That extra little punch can give any piece something special, even if it's something really small. </p>

<p>This is actually a really good thing to look at. I'll do this for a piece if I feel like my <strong>values aren't hitting a good range</strong>. You want to make sure you have a really good spread happening. You don't want to go to the top highlights, but you can see how you're punching up, grabbing your kind of midtones there.</p>

<p>Even just a subtle amount, you have to be so careful because you can completely <strong>blow out</strong> the whole piece. Even when you grab just a tiny, tiny bit, which is all that I've done here. You go back to the old one, and you're like, "Oh yeah, it does actually feel pretty washed out." Just that little touch at the end will help, it will finalize the piece.</p>

<h2>My Workflow Summary</h2>

<p>That is pretty much my workflow. I keep it <strong>pretty simple</strong>. Usually the hardest stage for me is <strong>finding a thumbnail</strong> that I don't despise. But if I can find a good thumbnail and the characters and composition are working well, I feel like I can <strong>sludge through the steps</strong> of getting to a piece that works.</p>

<p>Then it's about finding the small stuff and taking the time to <strong>stop yourself midway through a piece</strong> and ask, "What's working? What's not working? Do I have to move this around?" And if it's not working and something's bothering you, just <strong>stop to fix it</strong>. That is a big part of everything I do.</p>

<h2>Composition Choices for Small vs. Large Pieces</h2>

<p><strong>What composition choices do I make differently between a piece that's going to be displayed on a small part of something versus a larger piece that people see more of?</strong> That's actually a pretty big choice.</p>

<p>Usually, for the small ones, like when I'm doing work for <strong>Hearthstone</strong> or <strong>Magic</strong>, you definitely want something that feels really <strong>dynamic</strong>. You find a lot more people tilting the canvas a little bit, so it's not just a flat horizon. Basically, you're creating a piece with <strong>insanely readable characters at small size</strong>. That determines so much of your composition, how much they read.</p>

<p>Especially for Hearthstone, the character has to <strong>pop</strong> even more than in Magic. Hearthstone is very big on having your characters being completely <strong>front-lit with a light background behind them</strong>. So you're basically designing your entire composition based on those factors.</p>

<p>I've gotten tons of feedback from art directors before based on <strong>silhouette changes</strong> because they want it to be <strong>instantly recognizable just on the silhouette alone</strong>.</p>

<p>By contrast, if you're working on a <strong>large piece</strong>, it might not have to be read so clearly. You can spend time rendering the character kind of however you want, really.</p>

<h2>Approaches to Value and Color</h2>

<p><strong>In my workflow, do I ever posterize my picture to three values, black, mid-gray, and white, to see? ** I don't. There was a long period of time where I was spending doing complete </strong>grayscale illustrations**, before I took them to color. I was finding a lot of value problems in my work, so I spent the time, like a year or two, going back to grayscale, just so I could really figure out where my values were at. Then I'd bring it to color.</p>

<p>Lately, I can <strong>hop into color a lot faster</strong>. I don't do a lot of crazy weird things in Photoshop either. I kind of just sit there and I just <strong>start rendering</strong>.</p>

<p>I love super traditional fantasy. It works out that I do get amped up about drawing Warcraft, so it makes my day job a lot easier. I feel lucky for where I'm at because I can still get Warcraft assignments years later and be just as excited about working on them. So it's pretty good.</p>

<p>I should have my <strong>YouTube channel</strong> coming back soon, so keep an eye out for that. Thank you so much, it's always been awesome. I appreciate it.</p>
