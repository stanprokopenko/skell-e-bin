<h2>Basic Block Form and Perspective</h2>

<p>Start with a <strong>basic block form</strong> to represent the nose. This helps in building perspective onto the box. Think about the <strong>cartilage being added or subtracted</strong> to this basic form. Sculptors often sketch the profile of the nose to find the nasal spine, which is the interior structure that holds the cartilage together. You can feel the nasal spine by lightly touching the tip of your nose; it's the divot in the middle of the nose.</p>

<p>To get a likeness of the nose, look at the profile and note its shape (boxy, curved, irregular, broken). Apply this profile shape to the 3D box in your drawing. Use the <strong>keystone</strong> to find the base of the nose by dropping points to the tip of the nose. Use the center line and profile to interpret the nose in 3D. Plane off the nose by considering perspective and shape changes. Don't waste the effort of constructing the box; use it to nudge the nose to be more accurate.</p>

<h2>Nasal Spine and Profile Technique</h2>

<p>The <strong>nasal spine</strong> is crucial as it holds the cartilage together. Use the profile view to find the nasal spine and apply this profile shape to the 3D box in your drawing. This helps in understanding the form and perspective, aiding in building the nose accurately.</p>

<h2>Cartilage and Fat Shapes</h2>

<p>The nose has three basic shapes: <strong>alar, greater alar cartilage, and structural fat</strong>. Represent these shapes as a <strong>triangle, word bubble, and bell</strong>.</p>

<ul>

<li>The <strong>triangle</strong> represents the attachment area of cartilage.</li>

<li>The <strong>word bubble</strong> represents the rounder section of the nose.</li>

<li>The <strong>bell</strong> represents the fat that holds the nose against the face.</li>

</ul>

<p>Visualize how these shapes wrap onto the nose. The cartilage builds the under plane for the nose and separates the nostrils, while the fat holds the nose against the face. Consider the <strong>nasal saddle</strong>, which looks like a tiny saddle and broadens into the nasal aperture. Look for hard surfaces or highlights to identify planar areas.</p>

<h2>Combining the Nose with the Cheek</h2>

<p>Combine the nose with the cheek to avoid empty areas. The <strong>malar fat</strong> covers the cheekbone, providing a soft feel across the upper cheek and face. Consider the malar fat's role in aging and its coverage of the cheekbone. If this was a baby, the fat would be fuller and higher. Think about shape and placement, like smoothing clay up the face. The cheek has a soft intersection into the complex surface of the nose.</p>

<h2>Aging Effects and Facial Expressions</h2>

<p>A youthful face has higher fat placement; an aged face has it lower. The <strong>smile muscle</strong> connects the corner of the mouth to the front of the cheekbone. Expressions involve flexing face fat. Understanding facial planes helps with expressions and perspective. The malar fat creates the <strong>nasolabial furrow</strong> from the top of the nostril. The fat moves with the rounded surface of the mouth. Avoid making facial parts too autonomous or flat.</p>

<h2>Light, Shadow, and Depth</h2>

<p>Consider light and shadow impacts on the nose. Understand the depth and thickness of nasal planes. Design the nostril area by pushing up and taking away space. Consider aging effects like orbital septum weakening and fat herniation.</p>

<h2>Practical Tips and Techniques</h2>

<ul>

<li>Use <strong>Andrew Loomis's rhythm</strong> of the ear to the chin for facial alignment.</li>

<li>Features are built up from smaller perspectives, similar to the face structure.</li>

<li>Use a center line to see curves and attack the drawing directly.</li>

<li>Move lines based on awareness of nasal structure changes.</li>

<li>Adjust the box shape to reflect nasal saddle and cartilage.</li>

<li>Use <strong>S curves</strong> to show nostril turns and under planes.</li>

<li>Study basic box structures before adding small forms.</li>

<li>Design your own approach to drawing noses.</li>

</ul>

<p>By following these steps and understanding the underlying structures, you can create more accurate and lifelike drawings of noses.</p>
