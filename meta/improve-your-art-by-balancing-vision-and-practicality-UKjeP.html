<p>I recently chose a thumbnail featuring a biker gang and a bunny boy. I went with this concept because it offered the opportunity to draw edgier, cooler elements that would appeal to a different audience.</p>

<h2>Art Brain vs. Business Brain</h2>

<p>Something I often grapple with is <strong>my art brain fighting my business brain</strong>. My <strong>art brain</strong> wants to create purely for fun, exploring concepts that excite me. It's an essential part of being an artist. On the other hand, my <strong>business brain</strong> considers factors like the audience, whether someone would want this on their wall, and if it would appeal to studios I aim to work for.</p>

<p>Balancing these two sides is crucial. If either one takes over completely, I wouldn't be happy with the result.</p>

<h2>Adjusting the Concept</h2>

<p>With this in mind, I started making changes to the thumbnail. I thought about transforming the rough, eyepatch-wearing biker into a more appealing female character. Perhaps she could be doing something more wholesome than smoking, maybe eating a bowl of noodles.</p>

<p>I began by blocking in the main character without worrying about final lines, just to establish the space. I played around with poses, considering how the arms and legs affected the silhouette and overall composition.</p>

<p>I also pondered adding a cat to the scene to introduce a playful element. Using my own body as reference, I worked on hand positions, imagining her holding chopsticks and pointing.</p>

<h2>Struggling with Multiple Ideas</h2>

<p>As I continued, I realized I was juggling <strong>too many concepts</strong>: tough bikers, a wholesome meal, post-apocalyptic settings with plants growing everywhere, and playful cats. The piece was losing its focus. I remembered that when you make a piece about more than one thing, it often ends up being about neither.</p>

<h2>Refocusing on the Original Vision</h2>

<p>Recognizing this, I decided to return to my original vision. I committed to the initial composition and focused on making it a <strong>cool piece</strong> that relied on the appeal of the bikers. Sometimes, it's important to stay true to the artistic goals of your <strong>art brain</strong> rather than overthinking with your <strong>business brain</strong>.</p>

<p>I re-sketched the main character, ensuring her silhouette was strong and the pose conveyed the emotion I wanted. I kept the bunny boy character as initially planned, preserving the contrast between the two.</p>

<h2>Finalizing the Composition</h2>

<p>With the thumbnail remapped to the desired aspect ratio, I began working towards the final line art. I included elements from my research to create cohesion, like the unique design of the motorcycle and the central back tattoo on the biker.</p>

<p>Sometimes, the most important part is nailing the <strong>tone</strong> you want to achieve. By refocusing and not trying to force too many ideas into one piece, I was able to move forward confidently.</p>

<p>In the end, balancing my art brain and business brain allowed me to create an illustration that stayed true to my vision while still considering its appeal to others.</p>
