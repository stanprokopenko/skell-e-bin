<h2>Understanding the Three-Quarter View</h2>

<p>When I draw a three-quarter head, I like to think about <strong>box logic</strong> beneath all the details. I imagine a mashup of <strong>balls, boxes, and tubes</strong> that capture the simple yet characteristic structure. This helps me see beyond the complexity of anatomy, lighting, or expression.</p>

<p>I also make a habit of <strong>tracing over reference</strong> images or old masterworks. It trains my eye to recognize the basic forms that support realistic or stylized heads. It’s like learning a new language, patience, repetition, and immersion are key.</p>

<h2>Proportions and the Position of the Ear</h2>

<p>In a true three-quarter view, the ear’s position is a big help:

- The <strong>ear often lines up roughly with the back of the skull</strong>.

- As the head rotates from profile to a more front-facing angle, the ear moves closer to the silhouette of the back of the skull.

- By watching where the ear sits, I can judge how much skull or hair I see behind it.</p>

<p>This changes from a <strong>profile</strong> (where you often see more space behind the ear) to the <strong>three-quarter front</strong> (where the ear is almost at the back of the head). I keep that difference in mind so I don’t accidentally draw the skull too big or too small.</p>

<h2>Establishing the Center Line</h2>

<p>Once I’ve placed the basic head shape, I establish:

1. A <strong>center line</strong> down the forehead, nose, mouth barrel, and chin.

2. An <strong>eyebrow line</strong>, often parallel to the center line but sometimes tilted.</p>

<p>I check whether the center line is perfectly vertical. Many times, it’s tilted a bit back or forward. For a subtle tilt, I prefer to exaggerate slightly rather than not at all. That tilt creates more believable volume.</p>

<h2>Parallel Alignments</h2>

<p>I like to keep the <strong>center line</strong>, <strong>eyebrow line</strong>, and <strong>jaw line</strong> in mind as parallels. They might taper a little but, generally, they stay close to parallel. This consistency helps the forms read as solid and boxy rather than distorted.</p>

<h2>Front vs. Side Planes of the Face</h2>

<p>I pay attention to the <strong>turn of the planes</strong> around the eye socket:

- There's a <strong>zigzag transition</strong> at the corner of the cheek where the front plane meets the side plane.

- I usually see a distinct tonal change there in shading.

- I leave a sliver of <strong>front plane</strong> around the lower lid before I reach the side plane.</p>

<p>If I rush and cut that corner, the face can look flat. By preserving that strip of front plane, I keep the forms round and realistic.</p>

<h2>Applying Box Logic in Practice</h2>

<p>When I draw:

1. I <strong>lightly block in</strong> a box shape for the skull or the hairstyle.<br />

2. I <strong>square off</strong> parts like the chin if it helps me see the form.

3. I mark the <strong>eyebrow line</strong>, <strong>eyes</strong>, <strong>nose</strong>, and <strong>mouth</strong>. Everything is kept light so I can adjust.

4. I check <strong>how much cheek</strong> is visible on the far side of the face.

5. I look at the <strong>hairline</strong>, especially if it’s unique, to capture each model’s characteristic silhouette.</p>

<p>If something feels off, maybe the nose seems too long, I adjust. I’d rather correct early, not commit to a bad proportion.</p>

<h2>Example: Slight Low Angle and Slight High Angle</h2>

<p>When drawing from a slightly lower angle, I see more of the underside of the chin and jaw. I keep the same <strong>box logic</strong> approach, center line, eyebrow line, and ear alignment.

From a slightly higher angle, the top of the skull or hairstyle becomes more prominent. I still:

- Sketch an <strong>egg shape</strong> for the skull.

- Indicate a <strong>box</strong> around the chin or jaw.

- Set the <strong>center line</strong> to show how the face angles toward or away from me.</p>

<p>As always, I keep everything light and flexible until I’m sure of the proportions.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p>Every new angle offers fresh challenges, so I focus on the <strong>foundational forms</strong> before diving into details. By seeing the head as <strong>boxes, balls, and tubes</strong>, I maintain control over my proportions. Marking the <strong>ear</strong>, <strong>center line</strong>, and <strong>key features</strong> keeps the structure grounded. This process sets me up for success in rendering more realistic heads from any viewpoint.</p>
