<h2>Similar Silhouette</h2>

<p>When I draw legs from the back, I remind myself that the <strong>overall silhouette</strong> is the same as the front view. Instead of the crotch as a central landmark, I see the <strong>buttocks</strong>. That guides me in establishing the <strong>basic shapes</strong> before I refine the inside and outside contours.</p>

<h2>Inside vs. Outside</h2>

<p>On the <strong>inside</strong> of the leg, I keep things simple. On the <strong>outside</strong>, I often describe a <strong>dynamic S-curve</strong>. Sometimes the curve is subtle, and other times I exaggerate it for emphasis. This curve helps avoid a stiff or “fused” look. Even if I can’t see it strongly in the reference, I like to include a slight shift along that outside contour.</p>

<h2>Kneecap and Calf</h2>

<p>From the back, I don’t see the <strong>kneecap</strong> itself. Instead, I see the <strong>hamstrings</strong> splitting around the knee and the <strong>gastrocnemius (calf)</strong> forming a teardrop shape. When the foot is pointed or raised, the calf bulges a bit more. If it’s relaxed, it’s more like a subtle teardrop. I like to show a <strong>little bump</strong> or offset around the knee where the hamstrings transition into the calf.</p>

<h2>Constructing Forms</h2>

<p>I often:

- <strong>Mark the inside</strong> of the leg with a simple line.<br />

- <strong>Shape the outside</strong> with an S-curve that can bow out or stay subtle.<br />

- Identify the <strong>back of the knee</strong> and note where the <strong>calf</strong> rises into that teardrop.<br />

- Continue down to the <strong>ankle</strong> with the curve that connects these forms.  </p>

<p>I sometimes swing an <strong>abstract shape</strong> down through the leg and then refine it with smaller “bulges” for the calf. I’m mindful of “ping ponging” high and low points: if I bring one shape up, I’ll bring the next shape down for variety. This makes the leg <strong>flow</strong> and creates a pleasing <strong>architecture</strong> of forms.</p>

<h2>Variations and Iterations</h2>

<p>I try out different <strong>perspectives</strong> and <strong>subtle changes</strong>. The knee can angle toward or away from me. The calf can be more or less pronounced. Sometimes I approach the form in an almost <strong>bow-legged</strong> way, introducing a playful curve that still looks natural once I define the muscles. I enjoy tweaking these shapes to find the rhythm I want in each pose.</p>

<p>That’s how I think about putting together the legs in back view. It’s mostly about balancing <strong>simpler</strong> inside lines with <strong>more dynamic</strong> outside lines, while respecting the <strong>muscular landmarks</strong> like the hamstrings and gastrocnemius. These steps help me create forms that look three-dimensional and connected, no matter the pose.</p>
