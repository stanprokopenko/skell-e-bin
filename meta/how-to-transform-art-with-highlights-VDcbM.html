<h2>Preparing for the Lighting Stage</h2>

<p>I've moved on to the lighting stage of my coloring process, where I focus on adding light and <strong>highlights</strong>. To start, I organize my layers by grouping all my <strong>shading</strong> layers together and my <strong>flats</strong> in another group. Then, I create a new layer above everything for my highlights.</p>

<h2>The Transformative Power of Highlights</h2>

<p>Highlights can be the most <strong>transformative</strong> part of the coloring process. While shadows serve a functional purpose, highlights add <strong>style</strong> and can dramatically affect the overall color palette. By introducing a new highlight color, I can change the mood and tone of the piece significantly.</p>

<h2>Choosing the Right Highlight Color</h2>

<p>I usually select a highlight color that's <strong>brighter</strong> than the existing colors. Often, the highlight color is <strong>complementary</strong> to the overall palette, adding interest without straying too far. For this piece, I experimented with different intensities to see what works best. Sometimes, even a <strong>minor</strong> change can have a big impact.</p>

<h2>Balancing Highlights and Shadows</h2>

<p>A common question is how much of the piece should be in highlight versus shadow. It really depends on the <strong>light source</strong> and the <strong>effect</strong> you want to achieve. If I intensify the highlights, they can become the focal point, making the piece more about the highlight color itself.</p>

<h2>Avoiding "Hue Saturation Hell"</h2>

<p>When adjusting colors, it's easy to get trapped in what I call "<strong>hue saturation hell</strong>," endlessly tweaking settings without making progress. It's important to stay true to your original <strong>vision</strong> and not get lost in infinite adjustments. Experimenting is great, but having a clear goal helps keep you on track.</p>

<h2>Experimenting with Lighting Schemes</h2>

<p>I decided to intensify the lighting scheme by adjusting the overall saturation and hue. Shifting from cool to warm tones, I explored how different <strong>lighting</strong> can change the piece's feeling. For example, moving to a warm afternoon light gave the artwork a completely different mood. It's fun to play with these changes, even when I have a strong idea, because experimenting is where you'll <strong>grow the most</strong>.</p>

<h2>Adding Style with Highlights</h2>

<p>By choosing a bold highlight color, like an intense pink, I added a lot of <strong>personality</strong> to the piece. This approach shifts the focus from mere realism to a more <strong>playful</strong> and <strong>expressive</strong> style. It's about making a <strong>statement</strong> and letting the highlight color define the <strong>vibe</strong> of the artwork.</p>

<h2>Enhancing Surfaces with Highlights</h2>

<p>Adding highlights to surfaces like <strong>glass</strong> can bring them to life, making them appear more <strong>reflective</strong> and <strong>dynamic</strong>. It's important not to overdo it, though, a little highlight goes a long way. Too much can reduce its impact, so I try to use it sparingly to maintain its <strong>effectiveness</strong>.</p>

<h2>Adjusting Background Elements</h2>

<p>To maintain <strong>cohesion</strong>, I adjusted background elements to match the new highlight color. I played with the sky color and other components to ensure everything felt unified. Sometimes, rebalancing is necessary when you make significant changes to highlights. It's all about making sure every element works together to support the overall <strong>composition</strong>.</p>

<h2>Using Texture and Glow Effects</h2>

<p>I added soft <strong>glows</strong> and <strong>grain</strong> textures to enhance the atmospheric effect. Using a grain brush with a <strong>soft light</strong> blending mode, I simulated the way light can create a diffused, almost tangible presence in the air. This adds <strong>depth</strong> and <strong>interest</strong> to the scene, making it feel more lively and immersive.</p>

<h2>Layer Management and Final Adjustments</h2>

<p>Towards the end, my layers often become a mess of adjustments. I keep each effect on a separate layer so I can easily tweak or remove them if needed. I experiment with different blending modes like <strong>multiply</strong>, <strong>overlay</strong>, and <strong>hard light</strong> to achieve the desired look. It's essential to keep layers <strong>isolated</strong>, so changes in one won't adversely affect others.</p>

<h2>Revisiting Shadows</h2>

<p>With the new lighting scheme, I revisited the <strong>shadows</strong>, adjusting their colors to better fit the overall composition. Sometimes, I even consider turning off the shadow layer if it doesn't serve the piece anymore. It's all about finding the right <strong>balance</strong>. I might soften shadows in certain areas to emphasize focal points or to make the piece more <strong>cohesive</strong>.</p>

<h2>Finishing Touches</h2>

<p>In the final step, I focus on the <strong>finishing touches</strong>, which include coloring within the line art. I reserve this for the end because it ties everything together and depends on the underlying colors being finalized. I might also use tools like the <strong>blur tool</strong> sparingly to soften edges and adjust shapes. This step is where the artwork truly comes together, and all the elements harmonize to create a complete piece.</p>
