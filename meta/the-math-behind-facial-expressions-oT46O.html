<h2>From Words to Characters</h2>

<p>To bring a written character to the page, you need to translate words into visuals. There are steps involved because you have to draw the character and make them look like they're doing something. So how do you get from the written word to characters in action?</p>

<h2>Understanding the Math of the Face</h2>

<p>Start by <strong>drawing from the math of the face</strong>. This means using basic shapes and proportions to construct the head. Begin with an egg shape or circle, then <strong>divide it in half</strong>, and <strong>divide it in half again</strong> to establish the centerline and guidelines.</p>

<h3>Basic Head Structure</h3>

<ol>

<li><strong>Start with a round circle</strong>.</li>

<li><strong>Add the jawline</strong> to form the head shape.</li>

<li><strong>Find the centerline</strong>, which curves around the head.</li>

<li><strong>Divide the face into halves</strong> to determine the eye line, nose line, and mouth line.</li>

</ol>

<p>By committing this <strong>math</strong> to memory, you create a foundation you can alter every time you need it. This underlying structure is crucial every time you draw a face.</p>

<h2>Adding Character-Specific Features</h2>

<p>Once you have the basic head structure, you need to <strong>add character-specific details</strong>. For example, when drawing <strong>Namor</strong>, consider his heavy brow, high cheekbones, flat base of the jaw, and thick neck.</p>

<h3>Drawing Namor</h3>

<ul>

<li><strong>Orbital sockets</strong>: Remember that eyebrows sit along the top of the orbital sockets. For Namor, his eyebrows are high and arched.</li>

<li><strong>Side of the head</strong>: The face isn't flat. There's a side to the head, and features like the eyes stop at that corner.</li>

<li><strong>Heaviness of features</strong>: Emphasize Namor's heavy brow and prominent cheekbones.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Expressing Emotions Through Facial Features</h2>

<p>To convey different expressions, you need to adjust facial features like the <strong>eyebrows</strong>, <strong>eyes</strong>, <strong>nose</strong>, and <strong>mouth</strong>. Most changes in expression come from altering the eyebrows and mouth.</p>

<h3>Changing Expressions with Namor</h3>

<ul>

<li><strong>Anger</strong>: Bring the eyebrows down and arch them back up high. Tighten the brow and flare the nostrils. Pull down the corners of the mouth.</li>

<li><strong>Disapproval</strong>: Pinch between the eyes, add lines at the brow, and slightly frown.</li>

<li><strong>Surprise</strong>: Raise the eyebrows as high as you can, keep the eyes wide, and relax the nose. Open the mouth slightly to show shock.</li>

</ul>

<p>Remember to stay within the character's <strong>range of expressions</strong>. Avoid overacting or pushing the expression too far outside what fits the character.</p>

<h2>Understanding Facial Anatomy</h2>

<p>Knowing the <strong>muscle groups</strong> of the face helps you place features correctly. For example, the muscles around the mouth and the little protrusion on the side of the face affect expressions.</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Muscles around the mouth</strong>: Understand how they move to change expressions.</li>

<li><strong>Cheekbones</strong>: For characters like Namor, prominent cheekbones are essential.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Drawing Cartoony Characters and Children</h2>

<p>When drawing cartoony characters or children, proportions differ from adults. <strong>Children have different facial proportions</strong>, like larger eyes and fuller cheeks. Features are often exaggerated for a cartoony effect.</p>

<h3>Drawing Moon Girl</h3>

<p>Moon Girl is a fun, cartoony character with changing hairstyles. When drawing her:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Exaggerate features</strong>: Larger eyes that don't touch, big lips, and expressive eyebrows.</li>

<li><strong>Glasses</strong>: Remember that glasses follow the line you drew through the face. They sit on the front and turn according to the head's direction.</li>

<li><strong>Hairstyles</strong>: Her hairstyles change often, but her facial features make her recognizable.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Expressing Emotions with Moon Girl</h2>

<p>Moon Girl's face is elastic and expressive. You can have fun changing her expressions.</p>

<h3>Changing Expressions with Moon Girl</h3>

<ul>

<li><strong>Mischievous Look</strong>: Start with a slight smile. Adjust the eyes to show mischief and play with the eyebrows. This creates a look that says, "I'm going to do something."</li>

<li><strong>Angry</strong>: Lower the eyebrows, tighten the eyes, and flare the nostrils. You've seen her give this look when she's about to yell at Devil Dinosaur.</li>

<li><strong>Frustrated</strong>: Pull the eyebrows together, flare the nostrils slightly, and adjust the mouth to show frustration. She often makes this face when she's caught or has to admit she's wrong.</li>

</ul>

<p>When changing expressions:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Eyebrows are key</strong>: Most expression changes come from altering the eyebrows.</li>

<li><strong>Mouth adjustments</strong>: Pulling the lips under or pushing them out can change the expression immediately.</li>

<li><strong>Facial elasticity</strong>: With cartoony characters like Moon Girl, you can push the expressions further for effect.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Final Tips</h2>

<ul>

<li><strong>Practice the math</strong>: Always start with the basic structure. If you skip it, your figures may look wonky.</li>

<li><strong>Observe and research</strong>: Study the character's typical expressions to keep them acting accordingly.</li>

<li><strong>Play with expressions</strong>: The face is elastic and wonderful. Have fun exploring different emotions.</li>

<li><strong>Character recognition</strong>: Even with changes in hairstyle or clothes, consistent facial features make characters recognizable.</li>

</ul>

<p>Remember, you're making the character act through their expressions. So, keep practicing, and enjoy the process of bringing characters to life on the page!</p>
