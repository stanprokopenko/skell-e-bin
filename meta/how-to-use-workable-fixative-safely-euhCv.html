<p>When working on a drawing that you plan to develop further, it's crucial to use a <strong>workable fixative</strong>. This step is essential to prevent your drawing from smudging as you continue to work on it. Let me walk you through the process and share some important safety tips.</p>

<p><strong>Using Workable Fixative</strong></p>

<p>First, make sure you're using a <strong>workable fixative</strong>, like Krylon's. It's important not to confuse this with a final fixative. The workable fixative allows you to continue working on your piece without the risk of smudging, which is a basic but vital step in the process.</p>

<p><strong>Safety Precautions</strong></p>

<p>When you're ready to apply the fixative, remember to <strong>hold your breath</strong> while spraying. You don't want to inhale any of the fumes. It's best to do this outside to minimize exposure to harmful chemicals. I won't be showing this part on video, but I usually step out onto my porch, spray the fixative while holding my breath, and then quickly return inside, closing the door behind me.</p>

<p><strong>Allowing Fumes to Dissipate</strong></p>

<p>After spraying, it's important to leave your artwork outside for at least <strong>an hour and a half</strong>. This allows the fumes to dissipate. If you bring it back into your studio too soon, you'll notice a lingering smell, which indicates that the chemicals are still in the air. It's best to avoid this to ensure a safe and pleasant working environment.</p>

<p>By following these steps, you'll be able to protect your drawing and prepare it for the next stages of your artistic process.</p>
