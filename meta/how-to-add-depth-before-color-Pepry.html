<h2>Organizing Layers</h2>

<p>After finishing the sketch, I organize my <strong>line work</strong> by grouping all line layers (Ctrl/Cmd + G) and flattening them into one layer (Ctrl/Cmd + E). This gives me a clean line work layer to work with.</p>

<h2>Laying in Flats</h2>

<p>Underneath the line work, I create a new group called "flats". I start <strong>blocking in flat colors</strong>, no gradients, using the lasso tool. If you have a plugin that fills shapes instantly, that's great, but you can also use the lasso and paint bucket tools. I block out the entire base shape first, and this will serve as the foundation.</p>

<h2>Using Clipping Masks</h2>

<p>I place all subsequent layers within the base shape using <strong>clipping masks</strong>. By right-clicking a layer and selecting "Create Clipping Mask" or holding Alt while clicking between layers, I ensure all my painting stays within the base shape. This method allows me to <strong>stack layers</strong> while keeping everything contained.</p>

<h2>Defining Local Values</h2>

<p>I add <strong>local values</strong> for different materials. For example, the eyes and teeth are lighter than the skin. I quickly block in these areas, knowing we can refine them later. This step brings more clarity to the piece.</p>

<h2>Adding Shadows with Multiply Layers</h2>

<p>To add depth, I focus on the <strong>shadows</strong>. I create a new layer with the <strong>Multiply</strong> blending mode, which darkens areas while retaining the underlying colors. Using the lasso tool, I define shadow shapes based on my top-down light source. I darken areas like under the nose, the inner mouth, and the eyebrows.</p>

<h2>Simulating Light Fall-Off</h2>

<p>I use a soft round brush to simulate <strong>light fall-off</strong>, with an overall shadow pass. This technique directs the viewer's focus to the focal point, in this case, the face. By darkening areas away from the light, I enhance the three dimensional effect.</p>

<h2>Refining Values and Merging Layers</h2>

<p>Satisfied with the shadows, I merge the layers for more control. I refine and adjust the values, smoothing transitions and enhancing forms. Turning the line work on and off helps me see how the values stand on their own.</p>

<h2>Adding Highlights with Screen Layers</h2>

<p>To introduce <strong>highlights</strong>, I use a layer set to the <strong>Screen</strong> blending mode. This lightens areas while keeping the underlying context. I carefully add lighter values where the light hits directly, such as the brow, nose, and cheeks, enhancing the dimensionality.</p>

<h2>Iterating and Adjusting</h2>

<p>I continuously <strong>squint down</strong> to check the values, ensuring the lights and shadows work together. I adjust features as needed, sometimes repositioning elements like the eyes. Merging layers allows me to manipulate the painting freely, pushing and pulling shapes to improve the piece.</p>

<h2>Preparing for Color</h2>

<p>With the values in place, the piece is ready for color. Focusing on getting the values right in black and white makes adding color much more straightforward. Next, I'll start applying color on top of these established values to bring the piece to life.</p>
