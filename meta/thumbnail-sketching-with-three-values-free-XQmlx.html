<h2>What's in Premium?</h2>

<p>In this lesson, you'll practice value composition by creating thumbnails from provided photos. You'll simplify images into three values and compose different versions to explore variations. The lesson guides you through creating small, simple sketches, focusing on main ideas without details. You'll experiment with at least five iterations per photo, adjusting value groups and composition. The lesson also covers using pencils and markers, highlighting their advantages in thumbnail sketching. A Level Two challenge introduces more complex photos, encouraging you to create larger thumbnails with added detail. This project emphasizes deliberate decisions in value grouping and developing a clear hierarchy in your compositions.</p>
