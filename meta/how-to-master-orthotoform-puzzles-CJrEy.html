<h2>Opening Remarks</h2>

<p>The “ortho to form” puzzles ask for <strong>raw technical skill</strong> and <strong>inventive problem-solving</strong> at the same time. I see real, solid results in this batch, so the class is doing the work.</p>

<h2>Andreas (Smithies 3)</h2>

<p>Andreas pushed the plan views into space with slopes and even curved slopes that you can’t guess from the top view alone. When we rotate the block the curves are still true, so the invention works. Great job.</p>

<p>He posted under the handle “Smithies 3.” I note that in case a “Smithies 4” shows up later. He wondered if I was trying to kill the class. If that was the plan, I failed, he survived and finished.</p>

<h3>Vanishing Points &amp; Isometric Angles</h3>

<p>He tried to solve the block <strong>without vanishing points</strong> and felt that was a mistake. It can be rough but it isn’t fatal. Later we will study the historic architectural way to plot a cube by measurement instead of by sketching 9,999 boxes.</p>

<p>He also asked if using isometric angles is cheating. It is not. Try both and see which feels clear.</p>

<h3>Thin Wires Principle</h3>

<p>On his right-hand drawing, he drifted off the isometric alignment, maybe because he imagined the block swiveling. A <strong>containing box with thin guide wires</strong> would lock the shape in place. Principle, when no guides float in the air we cannot judge precise position, thin wires give us that reference grid.</p>

<h3>Lynn’s Assistance</h3>

<p>Lynn (“Lynn3”) jumped in like a pro teacher, answered Andreas, and cleared up the issue. I applaud Lynn for teaching and Andreas for asking like a future professional.</p>

<h2>Jay Minriv</h2>

<p>Jay ran a bold experiment with <strong>positive and negative forms</strong>, four extrusions, a castle motif, and other spins on one block. Even if the castle came from a real one, he still pushed the graphic into convincing 3-D. Strong work.</p>

<h2>Axonometric Perspective</h2>

<p>I paused to define axonometric flavors and singled out the <strong>Cavalier view</strong>, said to come from warriors looking down on a target. Each flavor exists to make some drafting jobs easier. A flat map is enough when we only plan to walk on the ground because we assume we will not suddenly fly over obstacles.</p>

<h2>CETA</h2>

<p>Dave (CETA) shot the plan <strong>a mile upward</strong> and built a tall monument. The top view never set a height cap, so that bold lift is legal and exciting.</p>

<h2>Rick B</h2>

<p>Rick cut <strong>negative space</strong> between units and let some blocks float above others. Thin wires track every vertical gap, so the structure reads. I like both of his finished sets.</p>

<h2>Vera Robson</h2>

<p>Vera offered the most inventive answer I saw. She kept the plus-sign footprint yet tilted each arm 30°, then did it again on a second axis. She also turned rectangles into cylinders, a twist I expected but few tried. We still read every hidden corner as a right angle, so the tilt works.</p>

<h2>Maria Biro</h2>

<p>Maria loves “brain puzzles.” That is the winning attitude for this course.</p>

<h2>Josh Drummond</h2>

<p>Josh rendered the forms in a <strong>wide-angle perspective</strong>. He used the <strong>melted-pancakes rule</strong>: near blocks tip toward us, distant ones flatten toward the horizon.</p>

<h2>JPC99</h2>

<p>JPC99 sketches on big newsprint, scans and cleans in Photoshop, and freehands every line. He reads horizon lines without a ruler and wonders if that is lazy. If the shortcut forces the eye to sharpen, then the laziness pays off.</p>

<h2>Jay Oshie</h2>

<p>Jay did the whole thing freehand and still balanced a creative spark with sound construction. That is exactly what I want.</p>

<h2>General Observations</h2>

<p>This project merges creativity with the <strong>scientific demand for precise, accountable lines</strong>. There is more work in the forum than I can mention here, so browse your classmates’ uploads.</p>

<h2>Closing Lessons</h2>

<ul>

<li>Study the students who nailed every construction line, they teach reliability.</li>

<li>Study the students who surprised us, they teach vision and daring.</li>

<li>I answered several questions in text already, read the threads.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Next Critique Preview</h2>

<p>Next time I will focus on tracking forms and making solid connections. See you then.</p>
