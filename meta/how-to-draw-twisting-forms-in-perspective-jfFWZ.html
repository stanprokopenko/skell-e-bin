<p>Lucy presented us with a formidable challenge, drawing a twisted arrow in perspective. This arrow isn't just bending, it's twisting and turning in space. A <strong>twisted arrow</strong> can be intimidating, but I believe it's better to face the fear and take up the challenge.</p>

<h2>Drawing a Prone Block</h2>

<p>Let's start simple. Begin with a block lying <strong>prone</strong> on the ground, that means it's lying flat. Drawing this is straightforward if you're familiar with our three line systems, the <strong>X, Y, and Z lines</strong>. We've worked extensively with these lines throughout the course.</p>

<h2>Bending the Arrow</h2>

<p>Now, let's bend the arrow. We want it to curve upward, and bend back around. This involves movement around the <strong>X-line</strong>. To capture this bend, we can think of an <strong>ellipse</strong> to represent the curve. Don't worry if it's not perfect, the ellipse is the most advanced part of this step.</p>

<p>Position the arrowhead at the top, noting that it has a <strong>Z-line</strong> that aims forward. We can scribe out one plane, and the <strong>X-lines</strong> will remain constant. By connecting these points with curves and maintaining consistent X-lines, we can begin to visualize the bent arrow.</p>

<h2>Twisting the Arrow</h2>

<p>Twisting the arrow adds complexity. A twisting form is not as easy as a bending one. We'll start again with a block lying prone. From the center on one side, run a line back and stand the block up, keeping the proportions in mind.</p>

<p>We're going to <strong>roll</strong> the form around the <strong>Z-axis</strong>, this is what aviators call a roll. At 90 degrees, what was facing one way is now facing another. We'll repeat this process, rolling the block further until it's lying prone again, but twisted 180 degrees from the start.</p>

<h3>Tracking the Corners</h3>

<p>To understand the twist, we need to track how the corners move. The top right corner crosses from one side to the other as it rolls. Drawing straight lines to connect these points helps us keep track.</p>

<p>We can use atmospheric perspective to reduce confusion. The key is to visualize how each corner moves through space as the form twists.</p>

<h2>Using Color Coding and Tracing Paper</h2>

<p>To further clarify the twist, we can use tracing paper and <strong>color-coded lines</strong>. Assign different colors to each corner (e.g., red, blue, green, brown) and draw curves that represent their paths.</p>

<h3>Drawing the Curves</h3>

<p>Start by marking the center points and drawing the curves intuitively. Remember, the vertical lines become horizontal as they twist, and vice versa. The curves should be continuous and smooth, aiming towards the correct points we've established.</p>

<p>Don't worry if the curves aren't perfect. We're aiming to capture the essence of the twisting motion.</p>

<h3>Understanding Right Angles in Space</h3>

<p>As the form twists, right angles change orientation. Vertical lines become horizontal, and horizontal lines become vertical. Grasping this concept is essential to accurately depict the twist.</p>

<p>We can refine our drawing by adding intermediate lines, keeping in mind how right angles behave in three dimensions.</p>

<h2>Key Principles to Remember</h2>

<ul>

<li><strong>Expect to fail repeatedly</strong>. This is really hard to do, and it's normal to struggle at first.</li>

<li><strong>Blocks help</strong>. Starting with blocky forms can make understanding twists easier.</li>

<li><strong>Color coding is essential</strong>. Using colored dots and lines helps keep track of different points and planes.</li>

<li><strong>The form must stretch</strong>. You can't twist a rigid object without bending it.</li>

</ul>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p>Twisting and bending forms in perspective is a complex task. It requires patience, practice, and a willingness to face the challenge head-on. Even though it's difficult, by following these steps and principles, we can begin to master the art of drawing twisted forms.</p>

<p>Thank you, Lucy, for presenting this challenge. It pushed us to explore new depths in our understanding of perspective.</p>
