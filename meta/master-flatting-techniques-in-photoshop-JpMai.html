<h2>What is Flatting?</h2>

<p>Flatting is a crucial step in the digital coloring process. It's the act of preparing a page by filling in all the different areas with <strong>flat colors</strong>. This makes it easier to select and manipulate specific parts later on. Whether you're flatting for yourself or another colorist, understanding these techniques can greatly improve your workflow.</p>

<h2>Essential Tools for Flatting</h2>

<p>Over the years, I've honed my flatting process using several key tools in Photoshop.</p>

<h3>Lasso Tool</h3>

<p>The <strong>polygonal lasso tool</strong> is my go-to. It allows for straight lines and, by holding <strong>Alt</strong> or <strong>Option</strong>, you can switch to freehand drawing. Unlike the regular lasso, if you let go, it won't close the selection. This flexibility is handy when you're interrupted or need to pause.</p>

<h3>Magic Wand Tool</h3>

<p>The <strong>magic wand tool</strong> is excellent for selecting areas based on color and line art. Ensure <strong>anti-aliasing is unchecked</strong> and <strong>tolerance is set to 2</strong>. When selecting, you can <strong>expand the selection</strong> by 1 or 2 pixels (using <strong>Select &gt; Modify &gt; Expand</strong>) to make sure the color fills under the line art without leaving gaps.</p>

<h3>Marquee Tool</h3>

<p>The <strong>marquee tool</strong> is useful for straight-edged selections like panel borders. Similar to the lasso and magic wand, make sure <strong>anti-aliasing is turned off</strong> to maintain clean edges.</p>

<h3>Pencil Tool</h3>

<p>Often overlooked, the <strong>pencil tool</strong> provides hard edges without anti-aliasing. It's more forgiving than the lasso and can speed up the process, especially when dealing with intricate details.</p>

<h2>Anti-Aliasing in Flatting</h2>

<p>A vital setting in flatting is <strong>turning off anti-aliasing</strong> on all selection tools. Anti-aliasing creates fuzzy edges, which can cause issues when selecting and filling areas later. By disabling it, you ensure sharp, clean selections and prevent unwanted <strong>artifacts</strong> between colors.</p>

<h2>Tips and Tricks to Speed Up Flatting</h2>

<p>Efficiency is key in flatting. Here are some methods I've found helpful:</p>

<h3>Using Actions in Photoshop</h3>

<p>Setting up <strong>actions</strong> for repetitive tasks can save a lot of time. For example, creating an action to <strong>fill with the foreground color</strong> or to <strong>expand selections</strong> can streamline your workflow. Assign these actions to keyboard shortcuts for quick access.</p>

<h3>Minimizing Redundancy</h3>

<p>Avoid duplicating efforts by selecting over existing flats and <strong>subtracting selections</strong>. For instance, if you've already flatted an area, you can lasso over it and then subtract the existing color using the magic wand with <strong>Alt</strong> or <strong>Option</strong> held down. This prevents you from retracing and speeds up the process.</p>

<h3>Simplifying Small Details</h3>

<p>Not every tiny detail needs to be individually flatted. For small elements that won't impact the overall image, consider simplifying. Over-detailing can make it harder for the colorist to select areas and can slow down the process.</p>

<h2>Personal Preferences and Flexibility</h2>

<p>Flatting methods can vary greatly between artists, and that's okay. What matters is finding a technique that works best for you and the colorist you're working with. Don't be afraid to adjust the process:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Communicate</strong> with the colorist to understand their preferences.</li>

<li><strong>Experiment</strong> with different tools to see which ones improve your speed and accuracy.</li>

<li><strong>Develop a workflow</strong> that makes sense for the page you're working on, whether that's background to foreground or focusing on specific elements first.</li>

</ul>

<p>Remember, flatting is a means to an end. The goal is to provide clean, efficient flats that make the coloring process smoother. As you gain experience, you'll find your own rhythm and preferences that suit your style.</p>
