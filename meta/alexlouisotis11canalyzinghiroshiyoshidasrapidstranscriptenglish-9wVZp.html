<p>Let's examine Hiroshi Yoshida's <strong>'Rapids'</strong> and observe how he masterfully uses perspective to depict water.</p>

<h2>Water Arranges into Ellipses</h2>

<p>Notice how water arranges itself into <strong>roundish shapes</strong> when you look down on it. However, when you view it from the side, as we do here, these shapes <strong>compress into ellipses</strong>. Yoshida is keenly aware of this effect.</p>

<h2>The Waterfall's Planes and Curves</h2>

<p>Observe how Yoshida perceives the <strong>top plane of the waterfall</strong> as a surface with some parts higher than others. This plane breaks and forms a <strong>sloping front plane</strong> with a gentle curve.</p>

<h2>Rhythm of Light and Dark</h2>

<p>He arranges a rhythm of <strong>light areas with dark patches</strong>, then <strong>dark areas</strong>, followed by <strong>light areas with dark patches</strong>. This is a matter of <strong>composition</strong>, not perspective. Yet, he does not sacrifice perspective to achieve this beautiful rhythm.</p>

<h2>Use of Cross Contours</h2>

<p>Yoshida employs perspective by making almost all the lines <strong>cross contours</strong>. Even the waterfall is treated as a portion of an <strong>interior cylinder</strong>.</p>

<h3>Treating the Waterfall as a Cylinder</h3>

<p>He makes the lines <strong>crowd together at the edges</strong>, as happens on the inside of a cylinder, and <strong>spread out</strong> as they face toward you.</p>

<h2>Scale and Distance in Wavelets</h2>

<p>Look at how the froth and wavelets <strong>get smaller</strong> in their structures as they recede into the distance, compared to the <strong>larger conglomerate shapes</strong> they form closer to you.</p>

<h2>Appreciating the Artwork</h2>

<p>While this piece is meant to be enjoyed for its beauty and not overanalyzed, understanding the perspective enhances your appreciation. Part of Yoshida's ability to create such a remarkable picture lies in his control of the <strong>convincingness</strong> of the water. It's like a cartoon, and yet it looks real.</p>

<h2>Applying Perspective Mastery in Your Work</h2>

<p>Use this artwork as an example of <strong>perspective mastery</strong>. Yoshida <strong>knew perspective</strong> and <strong>used perspective</strong> effectively. As you study, find images you can understand in these terms and that showcase skills you want to develop in your own work. <strong>Comb through them</strong> to notice the use of perspective.</p>
