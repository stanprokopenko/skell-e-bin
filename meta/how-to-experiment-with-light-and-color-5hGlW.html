<h2>Assignment: Exploring Light and Color</h2>

<p>For your assignment, try <strong>painting light from different angles</strong>. This is an advanced skill and can be challenging, especially in a beginner's course. Don't worry if you can't achieve the same level as demonstrated, that's okay. The goal is to <strong>cultivate curiosity about light and color</strong>.</p>

<h2>Using the Mountain Image</h2>

<p>I'm providing a JPEG image of a mountain for you to color, focusing on <strong>light and color rather than just local color</strong>. Try painting how the scene would look with:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Sunlight from the left</strong></li>

<li><strong>Sunlight from the right</strong></li>

<li><strong>Soft light</strong></li>

<li><strong>Depth and atmosphere</strong></li>

</ul>

<p>This exercise is a great starting point to become a <strong>student of light</strong>.</p>

<h2>Using the Simple Character Image</h2>

<p>If you prefer something simpler, I'm also providing a very simple image of a <strong>cute little character</strong>. Similar to what we did in the materials section earlier, paint this simple object while considering:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Light coming from the left</strong></li>

<li><strong>Light coming from the right</strong></li>

</ul>

<p>Keep it really simple and <strong>experiment with different lighting compositions</strong> on this basic form.</p>

<h2>Tips for Experimenting with Lighting</h2>

<p>To enhance your understanding of light and color:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Look at photographs</strong>, illustrations, and movie frames.</li>

<li>Observe how much <strong>color and fog</strong> artists add to create depth.</li>

<li><strong>Incorporate these observations into your images</strong>.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Working with Line Art in JPEG Files</h2>

<p>When you open these files, they are JPEGs with <strong>black line art on a white background</strong>. To paint without destroying the line art, use this trick:</p>

<ol>

<li><strong>Duplicate the layer</strong> with the line art.</li>

<li><strong>Hide the duplicated layer</strong> temporarily.</li>

<li>On the <strong>background layer</strong>, fill it with a color (e.g., fill with gray using <code>Option + Delete</code> on Mac).</li>

<li><strong>Unhide the duplicated layer</strong> and set it to <strong>Multiply mode</strong>.</li>

</ol>

<p>In Multiply mode:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>White areas become transparent</strong>.</li>

<li><strong>Black lines remain opaque</strong>.</li>

</ul>

<p>Now, you have a <strong>line art layer on top</strong> that you can use as a guide, and you can <strong>draw underneath it to experiment with lighting</strong> without affecting the original lines.</p>
