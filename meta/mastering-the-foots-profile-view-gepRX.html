<p>I want to focus on how the foot looks and behaves from a side view. When we consider the foot in profile, especially the <strong>weight-bearing foot</strong>, we need to understand how it grounds and supports the rest of the body. Whether I’m carrying groceries, hiking with a backpack, or just standing in place, the weight funnels down into the foot’s structure and disperses out through the arch.</p>

<h2>The Silhouette</h2>

<p>From a profile, the foot’s outer shape (or silhouette) stays similar whether I’m looking at the <strong>little toe side</strong> or the <strong>big toe side</strong>. However, there is a key difference with the <strong>ankle bones (malleoli)</strong>:

- On the <strong>big toe side</strong>, the malleolus (tibia) sits higher.<br />

- On the <strong>little toe side</strong>, the malleolus (fibula) sits lower.</p>

<p>This side-to-side change affects how the arch looks. From the front, if I could slice off the toes and just see the mid-foot, I’d notice the arch forming a half-circle. That arch carries the load from above and helps distribute the weight out toward both sides of the foot.</p>

<h2>Weight and Compression</h2>

<p>The arch is more than just a curve. It’s a <strong>shock absorber</strong>. When I place my weight fully on the foot, the arch <strong>compresses</strong> slightly:

- The foot flattens where it contacts the ground.<br />

- The <strong>little toe side</strong> can spread out more to form a small platform.  </p>

<p>When the foot isn’t carrying much weight, like in a seated pose, it can <strong>cup</strong> a bit because the arch isn’t forced down. Sometimes I even see a peek of the foot’s underside from the side view if the arch hasn’t compressed.</p>

<h2>Three Key Pieces</h2>

<p>I like to break the foot into <strong>three pieces</strong>:

1. <strong>The main wedge</strong> (mid-foot), connecting to the ankle and leg.<br />

2. <strong>The toes</strong>, often grouped together like they’re wearing a sock.<br />

3. <strong>The heel</strong>, a smaller wedge behind.</p>

<p>From the side, I imagine those wedges with <strong>right angles</strong> and trimmed tips. The <strong>ankle bone</strong> can be high or low depending on which side we’re seeing, and the arch can appear or stay hidden based on whether there’s weight pressing down.</p>

<h2>Stability and the “Tripod” Idea</h2>

<p>The foot’s shape reminds me of a <strong>camera tripod</strong> in how it helps me balance:

- The heel wedges back a bit, letting me rock backward without toppling.<br />

- The toes and ball of the foot widen in the front to stand firmly.  </p>

<p>Having two feet on the ground, often one forward and one back, keeps me stable from all sides. That’s why athletes plant their feet this way, for better support.</p>

<h2>Subtle Cupping</h2>

<p>A relaxed foot without direct weight doesn’t always lie flat. Often, it will <strong>cup</strong> up a bit:

- The <strong>arch</strong> remains raised.

- The <strong>little toe side</strong> might lift away from the ground.  </p>

<p>This cupping disappears once all my weight bears down and flattens the foot.</p>

<h2>Next Steps</h2>

<p>That wraps up the profile view. Next time, I’ll turn the foot around and show you the <strong>back view</strong>, which can be intimidating because of how the form changes from behind. Understanding this final view is crucial to finishing any figure drawing with confident, well-constructed feet.</p>
