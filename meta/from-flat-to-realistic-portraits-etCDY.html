<h2>Preparation and Initial Steps</h2>

<p>I started by establishing the colors for the scarf and green shirt. For the darker vest, I used black with a bit of red to warm it up, aiming for a dark brown without lightening it too much. This involved some trial and error to get the color close to the actual vest. I'm okay with the background and vest blending together, as it adds to the overall composition.</p>

<h2>Painting Techniques and Details</h2>

<p>I decided to bring the vest into the composition instead of having the scarf go over the shoulder. Establishing the shadow of the vest and other necessary details was crucial. It's important not to leave unfinished details, as they can be bothersome later. Sometimes, small details can make a painting more likable. I'm not fully rendering the vest, just indicating enough to establish the character. While unfinished areas might seem artistic, they can leave viewers unsatisfied. Most collectors prefer a complete story in a painting, not just a study.</p>

<h2>Artistic Decisions and Expression</h2>

<p>I try to tell the whole story in my paintings, for better or worse. Adding more details makes the painting feel more complete and less distracting. I'm not doing this to make people stare at it, but to have fun and avoid laziness. I'm taking artistic license to suggest the head is casting a shadow on a nearby wall, creating a mysterious shadow to focus attention on the face's harder edges. I'm also softening some corners for fun.</p>

<h2>Enhancing Realism and Texture</h2>

<p>Returning to the original color mixture can prevent deviations from getting out of hand. Final touches involve establishing relationships and rhythms in the painting. Adding surface texture with a palette knife or sponge contrasts with brushwork. As the painting nears completion, adding thick paint enhances texture. The trick to a glowing effect is a smooth, unnoticeable transition from light to dark.</p>

<h2>Process and Reflection</h2>

<p>The process started with a flat, two-dimensional look, which is necessary for realism. The painting evolved from a flat, posterized look to a more realistic one. The process involves using observation to get everything in the right place and size. The next stage involved adding half tones and transitions between light and dark areas. I demonstrated edge work by softening edges with my finger, which made a noticeable difference. Variations of color and brushwork add interest and realism to the painting. The final stage involved adding warm and cool variations to the flesh tones. The process is about simplifying and observing, even without advanced drawing skills. The goal is to create a decent painting by following the process in stages. Painting is complex, but breaking it down makes it more manageable.</p>

<p>It would be interesting to try the process again with a different model. I'll review the painting in the morning and add more if needed. I hope the process was useful and will continue tomorrow.</p>
