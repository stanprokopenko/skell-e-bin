<p>I'm going to show you how I draw, focusing specifically on how I think about <strong>gesture and structure</strong>, and how they connect. I consider these the foundations of any great art, combining energy and mass, the fluid rhythm of life with solid structure. We're going to compose gesture and structure together.</p>

<h2>Materials I Use</h2>

<p>Here's a list of the materials I typically use:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Strathmore 500 Series paper</strong>: A beautiful, high-quality paper.</li>

<li><strong>Conté à Paris pencils</strong>: I usually use a 2B, but any grade can work.</li>

<li><strong>Charcoal pencils</strong>: Any brand will do.</li>

<li><strong>Alphacolor square sticks</strong>: They come in boxes and are similar to pastels. I use these for rich darks when adding light and shadow.</li>

<li><strong>Kneaded eraser</strong>: I like using a dirty one, I'll explain why later.</li>

<li><strong>Hard eraser</strong>: For digging in and popping out the lights and highlights.</li>

<li><strong>Brush</strong>: To whisk off any little bits from the eraser.</li>

<li><strong>Sanding pad and stump</strong>: The stump is a rolled paper pencil with no pigment. I use sandpaper or the Alphacolor sticks to load it up and make marks.</li>

<li><strong>Paper towel and fingers</strong>: For really scrubbing in the tones.</li>

</ul>

<h2>The Foundations: Gesture and Structure</h2>

<h3>Understanding Gesture and Structure</h3>

<p>As artists, we're connectors. Our craft is a way to bring things together and compose. Gesture and structure are the two foundational ideas of any drawing. <strong>Gesture</strong> is about the energy and flow, the movement between forms. <strong>Structure</strong> is about the mass and solidity, the movement over the form.</p>

<p>I start by understanding the two-dimensional flat shape, like a graphic design, and then add the three-dimensional form. I aim to create beautiful shapes for the head, neck, and body parts, and then find a <strong>connective strategy</strong> between those parts. Within the design of the parts themselves, I infuse the <strong>life energy</strong>.</p>

<h3>Curves and Opposing Curves</h3>

<p>Living structures, especially organic ones, are mainly water, and they have a watery design made up of <strong>curves and opposing curves</strong>. By finding the curves and S-curves along the <strong>long axis</strong> of any form, we create connection. This long axis curve is where the life is. The more curves along the long axis, the more fluid and alive the drawing becomes.</p>

<h3>Combining Gesture and Structure</h3>

<p>I think of gesture as the long axis curve, and structure as the movement over the form. For example, when drawing a tube, I first draw the two sides and then the ends. Giving it a three-dimensional end by moving over the form (breaking the contour) provides structure. If I make the sides curved, it adds flow and liveliness.</p>

<h2>My Drawing Process</h2>

<h3>Starting with Simple Shapes</h3>

<p>I begin by laying in the figure using simple shapes, focusing on both the gesture and structure. I might start with an egg shape for the ribcage, and then build more refined structures on top of that. I keep working down, adding smaller structures as needed.</p>

<h3>Drawing the Gesture</h3>

<p>I draw the <strong>long axis curves</strong> to capture the gesture, the fluid connection between body parts. I move down the long axis of the ribcage, pick it up in the waist, and then in the hips, ensuring each area has good solidity.</p>

<h3>Adding Structure</h3>

<p>After establishing the gesture, I add the <strong>structure</strong> by moving over the form. This involves adding three-dimensional volume to the flat shapes. I use lines and shading to move over the short axis of the forms, giving them depth.</p>

<h2>Shading and Rendering</h2>

<h3>Using Shadows to Reinforce Structure</h3>

<p>I often come in with the <strong>shadow shapes</strong> to build the structure and double-check the construction. The shadows help to reinforce the form and provide depth. I follow a simple process:</p>

<ol>

<li><strong>Draw the two sides of the form</strong>: Establish the shape.</li>

<li><strong>Shape of the shadow on the form</strong>: Draw the core shadow, which is the beginning of the shadow where the form turns away from the light.</li>

<li><strong>Give the shadow a value</strong>: Fill in the shadow shape, ensuring it's darker than the light areas.</li>

<li><strong>Squint at it</strong>: Check if the shadows separate from the lights when you squint, and adjust as needed.</li>

</ol>

<h3>Blending and Gradation</h3>

<p>I use a zigzag technique to blend and gradate tones. The gradations move us <strong>over the form</strong>, enhancing the three-dimensional structure. I blend side to side to round off the forms, and then up and down if needed.</p>

<h3>Curves and Corners</h3>

<p>Forms either <strong>flow together</strong> in curves or <strong>break away</strong> at corners. When the forms flow, I use curves to connect them. When they break away, I introduce corners, which are often represented by sharper edges or cast shadows.</p>

<h3>Adjusting Shadows and Highlights</h3>

<p>I constantly <strong>squint</strong> at my drawing to see if the shadows and lights are working. If the shadows aren't dark enough or the halftones are too dark, I adjust accordingly. I might darken the shadows or lighten the halftones to maintain the separation between light and shadow.</p>

<h2>Building Details</h2>

<h3>Working with Halftones</h3>

<p>In areas with just halftone (no shadows), I use the stump or a dirty finger to pull tones down the long axis curve, then blend over the form with zigzags. This adds subtlety and depth to the lighter areas.</p>

<h3>Adding Highlights</h3>

<p>To bring out the highlights, I use a kneaded eraser or a harder eraser to subtract pigment. I go to the hottest spot of the highlight and gently erase, letting it gradate naturally into the surrounding tones.</p>

<h3>Incorporating Smaller Forms</h3>

<p>Once the big forms are established, I add smaller, secondary forms like ribs or muscles. I vary their spacing and shapes to avoid repetition and make the drawing feel more organic.</p>

<h2>Embracing Mistakes and Evolving the Drawing</h2>

<p>I often make adjustments as I work, sometimes moving elements or altering shapes. Mistakes can be opportunities to add character and action to the drawing. Drawing several lines and letting the audience figure out the right one can create a sense of movement and vitality.</p>

<p>By redefining what is "right" for us, we develop our own style. This approach gives us permission to play, and even mistakes can turn into something wonderful.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p>By consistently thinking about gesture and structure, and how they connect, we can create drawings that are both energetic and solid. Every mark we make, from the initial construction lines to the final shading, contributes to the overall composition. Remember to simplify when in doubt, break problems down into manageable steps, and most importantly, keep playing and exploring possibilities.</p>

<p>I hope this helps give you a sense of the process and possibilities. Keep practicing, and maybe I'll see you in another lesson.</p>
