<p>I like to think of the torso as a <strong>beanbag</strong> because the spine isn’t a simple hinge. Each vertebra can shift and bend in many ways, which creates an <strong>accordion effect</strong> in the abdominal area. This lets the rib cage and the pelvis tilt freely relative to each other.</p>

<h2>Why the Beanbag Approach?</h2>

<p>The torso often looks like two or three large egg-like shapes, rib cage, abdomen, and hips. I can treat those shapes as overlapping masses, and they can stretch and pinch as the spine bends.</p>

<p>• <strong>Stretch side</strong>: Where the torso pulls apart and appears long.<br />

• <strong>Pinch side</strong>: Where the forms squish and bunch together.</p>

<p>This approach simplifies a complicated set of bones and muscles into something more manageable. It also lets me visualize how the weight of the torso flattens against a seat or the ground.</p>

<h2>Breaking Down the Torso</h2>

<p>I often use:</p>

<p>• A <strong>rib cage shape</strong> (egg, tube, or box).<br />

• A <strong>belly or waist shape</strong> (smaller egg or bulge).<br />

• A <strong>hip shape</strong> (another egg or box).</p>

<p>Depending on the pose, I can cut each shape into smaller parts or combine them into bigger forms. Sometimes it’s just two shapes (rib cage and hips), and sometimes it’s three or more if I want to emphasize the abdomen or chest.</p>

<h2>Applying the Concept</h2>

<p>I look for the <strong>overlaps</strong> where one shape sits in front of another. In a side view or near-profile, I’ll keep one side simple while adding subtle curves on the other side. If the torso is seated, I’ll flatten the bottom egg shape to show where the weight presses down. Once I build these shapes, I can connect arms, legs, and other features.</p>

<p>When drawing in perspective, I visualize each mass with a <strong>grid</strong> that wraps around it. That helps me maintain volume and direction. Even if I’m not certain about the exact anatomy, I can direct these shapes to suggest the flow of the form.</p>

<h2>Combining Beanbags with Other Shapes</h2>

<p>Sometimes I mix the <strong>beanbag</strong> concept with the <strong>drumstick</strong> approach (a form pushed into another form). I might use a <strong>drumstick</strong> in the hips and a <strong>beanbag</strong> in the rib cage if it helps create a more natural overlap.</p>

<p>One shape can become a <strong>ball</strong>, another a <strong>tube</strong>, and another a <strong>box</strong>. By mixing them, I can quickly capture the posture of a figure and still keep it coherent. These combinations give me freedom to find solutions for complex poses.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p>This <strong>beanbag</strong> method gives me a powerful way to visualize the torso. By reducing complicated anatomy to two or three simple masses, I can more easily see how they stretch and pinch. Then, I can upgrade the basics with details like breasts, waist, and muscle groups. The goal is to simplify first, then refine as needed.</p>
