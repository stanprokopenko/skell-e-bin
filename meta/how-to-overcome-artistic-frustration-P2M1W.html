<h2>Moving on to Line Art</h2>

<p>Now I'm moving on to the next stage of my piece, the <strong>line art</strong> portion. I'm drawing the character I've been working with, and I'm thinking about the research we did, like the cute head shape inspired by a photo. Specifically, I'm focusing on how the head has a bump right after the eye.</p>

<h2>Using Cross Contours</h2>

<p>When drawing basic shapes, I like to add <strong>cross contours</strong>. These are little marks that go across the form, acting as reminders of the underlying shape. For example, they help me indicate the top plane versus the side plane without having to draw hard lines. On the bunny ear, adding cross contours shows its roundedness and three-dimensional form.</p>

<h2>Adding Volume to Lines</h2>

<p>One of the things I learned from watching Kim Jung Gi is always thinking about how to add more <strong>volume</strong> to what I draw. Lines can express volume, and that's been an eye-opening epiphany for me. When I'm drawing, I aim to include that little bit more information by indicating volume.</p>

<h2>Character Design Elements</h2>

<p>I never fully designed this bunny boy's outfit, it's mostly inspired by my real son's clothing. For example, he wears a drool bib that looks like a flower or peasant design, which is perfect because he's <strong>so poor</strong>, an inside joke between me and my wife.</p>

<p>When I have a big shape with nothing going on, I might use cross contours to give an edge to the bottom plane. Alternatively, I can add design elements, like a <strong>patch on the elbow</strong>, to give volume information and break up large blocks of color.</p>

<h2>Incorporating Previous Designs</h2>

<p>Sometimes, I like to playfully re-adapt things I've drawn into new character designs. For example, I thought about making the backpack an <strong>AC unit</strong>, inspired by previous sketches. Especially for anyone hoping to be a character designer, being able to adapt and reuse elements is something you should get a lot of practice with.</p>

<h2>Using Occluded Shadows</h2>

<p>I have a habit of adding <strong>hard shadows</strong> in the line art. Shading occluded shadows, areas where no light is going to hit, can help define the volumes and give a feel for what the piece will look like when shaded. It removes some flexibility to change up the lighting, but I shade areas that are usually in shadow, regardless of the lighting scheme.</p>

<h2>Brushes and Tools</h2>

<p>For my brushes, I'm using the <strong>Max Pack comic brushes</strong>, specifically the Max U Toothy Inker. It feels similar to the pen I use in traditional drawing. I use both <strong>Procreate and Photoshop</strong> interchangeably, but I prefer the drawing experience on Procreate with the Apple Pencil. I like being able to draw <strong>outside and be around people</strong>, so this setup works well for me.</p>

<h2>Dealing with Struggles in Line Art</h2>

<p>Sometimes when I look back at my old drawings, even ones I'm proud of, the line art alone doesn't look great. Much of my work depends on fixing things with color, or adjusting composition with color. If I'm struggling with a pose, I'll sometimes draw concrete parts I know I want, like the feet, and then connect the dots. This helps with difficult foreshortening.</p>

<h2>Developing Your Style</h2>

<p>The question about <strong>style</strong> is a big one. Style is something that generally happens naturally as you draw and draw inspiration from other artists. It's not something you have to force. If you only copy another artist's style, it will look like their style, not yours. Focus on drawing artwork that <strong>appeals to you</strong>. Your unique taste will develop over time, and your style will emerge from that.</p>

<h2>Understanding Volumes</h2>

<p>When you're trying to get to a professional level quickly, you might try to make your artwork look like professional artwork by copying pieces you like. But if you don't understand <strong>why a line is drawn</strong> the way it is or the underlying volumes, your work can end up looking like a collection of <strong>stamps</strong>. It's important to understand volumes so you can manipulate and play with the forms, rather than just translating what you've seen.</p>

<h2>Dealing with Frustration</h2>

<p>When I get frustrated or want to give up, I remind myself to be <strong>nicer to myself</strong> and sometimes just <strong>ignore</strong> the part that's bothering me. I work on other things or take a break. Sometimes stepping away and coming back with fresh eyes helps me see what needs to be fixed without sweating it too hard.</p>

<h2>My Art Journey</h2>

<p>My art journey has mostly been <strong>self-taught</strong>. I didn't go to art school, but I took art classes in college to have time to draw. The classes weren't geared towards the entertainment industry, they focused more on experimental and conceptual art. I worked in games and film in roles that didn't require me to draw, as my main job. I kept drawing as a <strong>hobby</strong>, focusing on foundations and practicing for my own enjoyment.</p>

<p>I drew a piece featuring <strong>Psyduck</strong> that I'm most famous for, which led to offers to do work as an artist. It was more of an accident than an intentional shift in my career. I was planning to take a break and ended up getting paid to <strong>draw for fun</strong>, which was great.</p>

<h2>Working Environment</h2>

<p>I have a home office, but I prefer to spend time drawing <strong>outside at a caf√©</strong>. Being in a public space helps me get into a <strong>flow state</strong>, where I second-guess myself less and just make the work. Professional work is sometimes easier because it's more about someone else's vision, and I can focus on embodying what they want.</p>

<h2>Digital vs Traditional Drawing</h2>

<p>I started drawing digitally at a young age, becoming used to digital tools early on. However, switching back to <strong>traditional drawing</strong> was a renaissance for me. Drawing digitally is about executing exactly what you have in mind, while traditional drawing involves more <strong>experimentation</strong> and happy accidents. I learned a lot about my own understanding when I approached things traditionally, and it was a fun, enriching experience.</p>

<h2>Pushing Through Challenges</h2>

<p>While working on art, I often go through phases where I both <strong>hate and love</strong> the piece. There are days when everything goes smoothly and others when it's a risky game. If you feel this way, you're not alone. Professional artists experience this too. Pushing through these challenges is part of the process, and <strong>finishing drawings</strong> helps develop the skill of completing a piece.</p>

<h2>Making Changes and Keeping Ideas Fresh</h2>

<p>Sometimes an idea isn't working, and it's important to keep things <strong>fresh</strong>. Switching directions can help alleviate the nagging sense that something isn't good enough. Either take a break or try something else that's exciting and fun. Returning to that sense of <strong>joy</strong> when the drawing is going well is crucial.</p>

<h2>Reviewing Decisions and Moving Forward</h2>

<p>I made several changes to my piece, including adjusting the characters and the story. I incorporated elements from previous designs and focused on creating a composition I was happy with. Now, I'm ready to move on to the next step: <strong>flatting and coloring</strong> the piece.</p>
