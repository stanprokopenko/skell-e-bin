<p>Hi everyone! I'm excited to share some insights from our recent ortho critique session. It's amazing to see so many of you dive into this project with enthusiasm. Drawing objects from multiple orthographic views is a valuable exercise to understand forms from all angles.</p>

<h2>Challenges with Complex Forms</h2>

<h3>Vera's Chair Illustration</h3>

<p>Vera took on an advanced object, a chair with curves, and even colored it. While adding color isn't required, it can sometimes distract from the main goal. <strong>Curves in orthos</strong> can be tricky. When dealing with curves, it's essential to understand the underlying straight lines. Finding the center of a curved plane helps in accurately representing it. Despite the complexity, Vera did a great job.</p>

<h3>Cheyenne's Winged Object</h3>

<p>Cheyenne was the first to post, and she thoughtfully included top, front, back, and underneath views. <strong>Understanding how wings project in different views</strong> can be challenging. It's important to use top or bottom views to clarify how parts of an object move towards or away from us. Proximity and perspective can influence our perception, so multiple views help in accurate representation.</p>

<h2>The Importance of Auxiliary Views</h2>

<p>Engineers often use <strong>auxiliary views</strong> when dealing with objects that have oblique angles or patterns not captured in standard orthos. Creating these additional views helps in understanding and accurately depicting complex forms.</p>

<h2>Simplifying Complex Objects</h2>

<h3>Melanie's Shoe Projection</h3>

<p>Melanie animated a shoe and showed how front and back views have the same silhouette in orthos. She also demonstrated projecting from a top view, creating oblique views. Remember, in orthographic projection, there's no diminution, <strong>everything stays its constant size</strong>.</p>

<h3>Rick's Pencil Sharpener</h3>

<p>Rick felt overwhelmed by the detail on his pencil sharpener. It's normal to feel that way when starting out. Complex objects can be intimidating, but breaking them down into simpler parts makes them manageable. Comparing orthos with perspective drawings can also help highlight differences and deepen understanding.</p>

<h2>Understanding Silhouettes and Perspectives</h2>

<p>Front and back views have <strong>identical silhouettes</strong> in orthos because the camera is considered infinitely distant. This means there's no perspective distortion. Recognizing this helps in ensuring consistency across different views.</p>

<h2>Approaches to Orthographics</h2>

<h3>Starting with Right Angles</h3>

<p>Choosing objects with right angles, like Spiridon's sofa, simplifies the process. It allows you to focus on the relationships between different views without the added complexity of curves or oblique angles.</p>

<h3>Swiveling and Comparing Views</h3>

<p>When working on orthos, think of swiveling the object on different axes. Comparing landmarks across views ensures accuracy. For example, the height of a part in the front view should match its height in the side view.</p>

<h2>Facing Difficulties and Overcoming Them</h2>

<h3>Randy's Scissors</h3>

<p>Randy tackled pneumatic scissors, a complex object due to its angles. Sometimes, an object might be more challenging than anticipated. If so, consider simplifying it or starting with an object with more right angles.</p>

<h3>Glenn's Stapler</h3>

<p>Glenn chose a stapler and found the front and back more complex than expected. It's a common sentiment. The key is to take your time, compare different views, and ensure that all parts align correctly.</p>

<h2>Simplifying to Learn</h2>

<h3>Dave's Simplified Car</h3>

<p>Dave did an excellent job simplifying a complex car into mostly right angles. Simplifying helps in understanding the fundamental structure before adding details. It's a valuable step in tackling complex forms.</p>

<p>I recognize that this project is challenging, but every problem is solvable. Start with simpler objects if needed. <strong>The goal is to understand the necessary information to represent an object accurately.</strong> This exercise is scientific and logical, but our next lessons will dive into more creative aspects. Stay curious and keep practicing!</p>
