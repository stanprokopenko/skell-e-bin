<p>Where we're at at the moment: we've done our sketch, blocked in some values and colors, and started to play around with the lighting to really show more of the form. Now it's time for refinement.</p>

<h2>Keeping Values Logical</h2>

<p>It's important to keep an eye on our <strong>values</strong>, making sure every decision we're making is logical and in context with all the other shapes around it. We don't want to start throwing specular highlights <strong>willy-nilly</strong> because they look cool at the moment. We need to think about where the <strong>light source</strong> is and why we're placing certain values, lights, and colors in certain places.</p>

<h2>Enhancing the Background</h2>

<p>To make the piece more visually interesting, I like to <strong>spice up the background</strong> a little bit. On the background layer, I use the hue/saturation options (Command or Control U) to adjust the color. For example, cranking up the brightness and selecting a nice yellowy-orange color, I'm inspired by the color of school buses here.</p>

<h2>Playing with Color Variations</h2>

<p>Now that we've got our values in place, we can start to play around with some more <strong>out-there color notes</strong>. I use the Filthy Plugin to add some color variations, especially in the darkest darks. This plugin allows me to add little color notes similar to the background and knock them back if they're too in-your-face.</p>

<h3>Using Luminance Lock</h3>

<p>With the plugin's <strong>luminance lock</strong> feature, I can choose the value I want and add color variations while keeping the same value. It does a tricky thing in the background to maintain similar background values, making it easier to add color variations without messing up the values I've already established.</p>

<h2>Fixing and Refining</h2>

<p>At this stage, we can take our time to <strong>fix up any little places we've missed</strong>. For example, I might add a drop shadow, but if it's too much, I'll knock it back with the eraser tool. I also look for areas that are messy and clean them up completely, refining the value transitions.</p>

<h2>Merging and Cleaning Up</h2>

<p>Once I'm satisfied, I might merge everything down, duplicate the layer (Command or Control J), and continue to clean up some of the lines. It depends on how clean you want to go with this, you don't have to clean it up a crazy amount. Refining shapes and values helps reduce visual noise, making the image clearer.</p>

<h2>Experimenting with Lighting</h2>

<p>I like to experiment with adding another rim light on the other side to offset the harsh rim light we've already got. Maybe I'll use a softer, warmer light on this side to tie it into the background a bit more. Using the lasso tool, I can find shapes that make sense and add dynamics to the piece.</p>

<h3>Adding Shadows</h3>

<p>After adding lights, I also add in the shadows that would be there. This grounds the image a bit more in reality. Since it's on a separate layer, I can adjust as needed without affecting the rest of the painting.</p>

<h2>Zooming Out and Evaluating</h2>

<p>It's a good idea to <strong>zoom out</strong> and take a step back to look at the image as a whole. This helps you see what needs to be done. When it comes to detail, I don't go overboard because no one's really going to be zooming in that far in reality.</p>

<h2>Using Black and White to Check Values</h2>

<p>There's a shortcut to do this, but I often add a black and white layer to <strong>check my values</strong>. This brings us back to where we were in the beginning and gives us a clear look at where we're at. It helps to see if everything works from a value perspective.</p>

<h2>Adjusting the Background</h2>

<p>We can do something with the background to make the subject <strong>pop</strong> even more. For instance, I might add a gradient or adjust the colors to make it fit the attitude or mood of the piece.</p>

<h2>Adding Subtle Details</h2>

<p>The lasso tool or airbrush can be used to add a little <strong>sheen</strong> to the hair or other subtle details. At this stage, it's really just going back and forth and seeing what works. Maybe certain areas need to be lightened or adjusted.</p>

<h2>Rotating the Canvas</h2>

<p>Don't hesitate to <strong>rotate the canvas</strong> to get a different angle that feels more comfortable. You don't need to stay at the exact same angle all the time. This can help when you're refining certain areas.</p>

<h2>Taking a Break</h2>

<p>At this point, I would honestly take a break. A good tip is to <strong>export it to your phone</strong> and look at it at a smaller size. You'll be surprised how much you can observe at a much smaller size and notice things that need adjustments.</p>

<h2>Final Tweaks</h2>

<p>As I continue refining, I notice new things that need attention. It's a back-and-forth process, finding areas that need to be lighter or darker, making adjustments whenever needed. Zooming out helps to see the overall piece, and make sure the values make sense.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p>I spent a little more time on this, just making a few tweaks here and there. Sometimes it's not a quick process. Sometimes I don't want to spend all my time doing the values first and then adding the color over the top, sometimes I just want to go straight to color, which you definitely can do. This is just <strong>one way</strong>. Give it a shot, and you might like it. If not, take bits and pieces that you've learned that might be useful to you, and run with them.</p>
