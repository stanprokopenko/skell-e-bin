<h2>General Feedback</h2>

<p>Overall, the work this week looked good. However, some consistent issues were noted from last week's steps.</p>

<h2>Jawline Corrections</h2>

<p>Avoid excessive curvature from the hairline or brow. Keep the jawline parallel to the head's tilt to prevent distortion. Start with a flat plane for the jaw and build the form on top.</p>

<h2>Neck Positioning and Gesture</h2>

<p>Ensure the neck is not too stiff; it should reflect the spine's directional angle. Translate the spine's angle to the neck, pushing the head forward in space. Exaggerate the pinch and stretch for storytelling. For heads viewed from the back, the neck goes the opposite way.</p>

<h2>Proportions and Measurements</h2>

<p>Proportions of halves and thirds are generally good. Measure the chin's position relative to the skull for accuracy. The jaw's proportion does not change; it is hidden or obfuscated by the cranium. Ensure the tilt matches the drop of the face plate or jawline. Develop a system of comfortability for the jaw's shape.</p>

<h2>Common Mistakes and How to Avoid Them</h2>

<p>Avoid too many rigid measurements to allow for stylization and character effects. Ensure the neck is a three-dimensional diagonal, not just a two-dimensional shape. Narrow the brow to the front and broaden it towards the back for a better skull shape. Check the ear's position and height relative to the brow and nose. Avoid letting the jawline get too curved.</p>

<h2>Importance of Perspective and Three-Dimensionality</h2>

<p>Understand the approximate shape of the jaw relative to the skull without overloading with rules. Push the neck forward to read the under-plane and tie it to the jaw. Ensure the skull shape matches the sockets. Move proportions around and bring the chin up for a well-proportioned skull.</p>

<h2>Final Thoughts and Encouragement</h2>

<p>Focus on the <strong>brow to ear proportion</strong> and the <strong>center line</strong>. Manage forms carefully, ensuring the neck has a good directional shape. Recognize that this is a hard study, and similar mistakes are common. Overall, the attempt at proportions was good. We'll develop this further next time.</p>
