<h2>What's in Premium?</h2>

<p>Learn to use the <strong>X</strong>, <strong>Y</strong>, and <strong>Z</strong> axes to draw objects in perspective. This lesson teaches you how these three guiding lines help navigate and measure in three-dimensional space. Move from drawing flat angles to capturing views that slant into space, like three-quarter and oblique views.</p>

<p>Understand the importance of right angles in creating a three-dimensional compass. Discover why we use <strong>X</strong>, <strong>Y</strong>, and <strong>Z</strong> instead of directions like up, down, left, and right. Apply these axes to objects, using <strong>X</strong> for width, <strong>Y</strong> for height, and <strong>Z</strong> for depth with vanishing points.</p>

<p>Practice assignments are included to help you label axes and sketch objects at different complexity levels. By the end, you'll be prepared to handle complex spatial structures using the primary axes.</p>
