<p>Let's talk about the <strong>quality of light</strong>. As an illustrator, it's essential to understand what this means. The term is often used by lighting artists and cinematographers, but many people aren't familiar with it.</p>

<h2>The Size of Light Sources and Quality of Light</h2>

<p>When you have small, bright light sources like the sun on a clear day, you get <strong>sharp shadows</strong>. The fall-off, or the <strong>terminator angle</strong>, is very small. As you increase the scale and size of light sources, the quality of light changes, not to a higher or lower quality, just a different one.</p>

<p>When light sources become bigger, the <strong>terminator edge</strong> spreads around the object, giving you a different look. The shadows become <strong>softer</strong>. You can utilize this as a tool. Ask yourself, what look do you want? Do you want a very <strong>sharp, high-contrast image</strong>, or a <strong>soft</strong> one? What quality of light do you want?</p>

<h2>Primary and Secondary Light Sources</h2>

<p>There's a way of lighting where you think about <strong>primary light sources</strong>. If there's a spotlight on a character, this is primary light straight from the source. This is considered <strong>specular light</strong>, the sharp light coming directly from the source.</p>

<p>Once that light bounces off an object, it <strong>diffuses</strong>, and the quality of light changes. This creates a <strong>secondary light source</strong>, as if the light is bouncing off an object.</p>

<h3>Specular Light</h3>

<p>The <strong>key light</strong> is the brightest light source in your scene that shapes the characters' faces. For example, in a shot where candles are the light source, they are the primary key, shining directly onto the characters' faces. In another shot, sunlight serves as the primary light, directly illuminating the character's face. A beam of light from above can also act as a primary light source.</p>

<h3>Bounce Light</h3>

<p>In some shots, the light bounces off the wall and then back onto the character's face. There's a different quality to the light because it's <strong>bounce light</strong>. It's softer, and you can use <strong>secondary light as a key</strong>, or <strong>bounce light as a key</strong>. For instance, light hits the floor, doesn't directly hit the character, bounces off the floor, and gives a different mood and feeling.</p>

<h3>Mixed Keys</h3>

<p>You can have <strong>mixed keys</strong>, where different characters are lit differently. For example, children are in the light, and adults are in the shadows. The children are lit by bounce light, while another character is lit by direct sunlight. In a scene from the film <strong>Klaus</strong>, a character stands half in the light and half in the shadows, representing a point of transition. It's a compelling use of visual storytelling using light.</p>

<h2>Examples in Film</h2>

<h3>Live-Action Films</h3>

<p>Let's look at some examples from live-action films where characters are lit with <strong>indirect lighting</strong>. The brightest light source, the <strong>key light</strong>, doesn't come directly from the sun but from the sun bouncing off a wall and then onto their faces. This gives a <strong>softer quality</strong> to the light than direct sunlight. The light wraps around the face because it's been diffused off that large wall, softening the sun and the light source, and giving a different quality to the scene.</p>

<p>In other scenes, light diffused through curtains provides a different quality. It has mood but also a softness that's really interesting. In car scenes, soft light sources wrap around the characters' faces, allowing you to understand the light and dark sides of their faces.</p>

<p>There's a trend in cinematography where light is bounced off a table and onto the characters. The primary light source onto the characters' faces is <strong>bounce light</strong>. Even if the table is overexposed, the characters are properly exposed because of the bounced light. In interrogation scenes, it's popular to have mood lighting, with a mysterious spotlight shining onto a table. You don't know where the light comes from, but it's used as the main source that bounces onto the characters' faces, adding mystery and a beautiful soft light to help shape the characters' form.</p>

<h2>Golden Hour and Blue Hour</h2>

<p>Let's talk for a minute about <strong>golden hour</strong>. Golden hour is when the sun gets low in the sky right before sunset. It's a beautiful time of day because you can <strong>backlight</strong> characters. The sun is low enough to provide a <strong>rim light</strong> without coming from above, avoiding that "raccoon eyes" effect. You can have long, stretching shadows, with some parts in shadow and others in the sun.</p>

<p>Sometimes, when the sun starts getting a little bit lower, you get a soft effect of the light and the glow of the sky. The quality of light is different when the sunlight is shadowed.</p>

<p>When you reach what we call <strong>blue hour</strong>, the sun has just set and is below the horizon, but there's still light in the sky. The sky has a blue hue, tending to be cooler, and the quality of light is very soft. For example, in a photograph taken just after sunset, you can still see the glow from the sun in the sky on the left part of a person's face. It wraps around with a very soft, appealing quality of light.</p>

<h2>Cinematography Techniques</h2>

<h3>Diffusing Light</h3>

<p>Talking about the quality of light, there are some cinematography tricks. If a character is backlit in the middle of the day, you can use that as a rim light, and then light from the ground (like sand) bounces up onto the characters' faces. In the movie <strong>Jumanji: The Next Level</strong>, Dwayne Johnson is lit nicely with sunlight.</p>

<p>However, for reverse angle shots, they might not have the ability to wait for the sun to move. The character would have been lit with very harsh, top-down sunlight, giving that "raccoon eyes" effect with harsh shadows or overexposure. So what do they do?</p>

<p>They <strong>diffuse the light</strong> in the foreground using something like a diffusion cloth called a <strong>fly swatter</strong>. It's a common practice in film. Sometimes they fly a balloon up to just take the edge off the light, softening it. If you look at the quality of light on the character's face, it has very soft shadows, whereas in the background, there are harsh shadows in areas not diffused.</p>

<h3>Using Bounce Light</h3>

<p>In the TV show <strong>Stranger Things</strong>, you can see shots where sunlight coming from screen right has been diffused to be less intense. It softly wraps under their faces, and they have some sort of bounce card off-screen that helps give good shape and form to their faces from <strong>bounce light</strong>. In these shots, the sunlight has been seriously diffused, and they have a large bounce light that helps give good shape.</p>
