<p>Welcome back, everyone. We're doing another session of critiques, focusing on gestural architecture. Apologies for my voice; I've been a bit sick. I have some turmeric golden milk, which is delicious.</p>

<h2>General Advice</h2>

<p>Maintaining <strong>three-dimensionality</strong> is crucial. Avoid losing the corners to keep the illusion of depth. Ensure lines converge to a vanishing point for foreshortening. When deforming, consider the entire form, not just individual lines. A good balance is an 80/20 rule of perspective to gesture.</p>

<h2>Individual Critiques</h2>

<h3>Saschu's Submission</h3>

<p>Your drawing is very bloated, which is mostly good. However, you curved everything outwards and lost the three-dimensionality by losing the corners. This makes it feel like cut-out pieces of paper rather than a 3D form. You need to maintain the illusion of depth by keeping clear plane changes. The plane change in your drawing goes up and back, which is the opposite of what it should be. This makes it feel less three-dimensional and more like flat shapes. You still have some depth due to overlaps and a few corners, but many corners are missing. For the roof, the lines should converge to a vanishing point to maintain the foreshortening effect. I would have made the corner less pronounced to keep some perspective. When deforming, think of the entire form, not just individual lines.</p>

<h3>Lasuli's Submission</h3>

<p>Lasuli's submission is a great balance between gesture and structure. Everything follows perspective, with slight tilts making it look fun and organic. Clear plane changes and good details that follow perspective. No critiques for Lasuli; it's a great example.</p>

<h3>Matias' Submission</h3>

<p>Matias' submission has a house in the back that looks three-dimensional. The middle house is very distorted, and the right house still has perspective but with independent lines. The lines are not coming together to indicate the whole form. The middle house loses form due to over-distortion.</p>

<h3>Johannes' Submission</h3>

<p>Johannes' submission is fun with great roof details and slight deformations. The subtle deformations make it believable and fun, like a storybook. The tall house also has subtle deformations, making it feel alive.</p>

<h3>Jayoshi's Submission</h3>

<p>Jayoshi's submission took seven to eight hours each, showing great effort. The chimney feels strange due to misalignment with the roof. Some areas lack thickness, making them look paper-thin. The castle has extreme distortion but still holds up with depth and perspective.</p>

<h3>Diana's Submission</h3>

<p>Diana's submission looks melted, losing too much perspective. The curves on top are unclear, making the form hard to understand. The tree house is interesting but looks melted, making perspective difficult. Overlaps and thickness indicate some perspective, but more plane changes are needed.</p>

<h2>Common Issues and Solutions</h2>

<ul>

<li><strong>Over-distortion</strong>: Leads to loss of three-dimensionality.</li>

<li><strong>Clear Plane Changes</strong>: Essential for maintaining depth.</li>

<li><strong>Effective Use of Distortion</strong>: Maintain form while being creative.</li>

<li><strong>Handling Extreme Angles</strong>: Important for perspective.</li>

<li><strong>Adding Structure</strong>: Elements like tree trunks need corners for a secure feel.</li>

<li><strong>Avoiding Random Distortions</strong>: Maintain structure and clarity.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Positive Examples</h2>

<ul>

<li><strong>Fabio's Work</strong>: Fun and well-executed.</li>

<li><strong>Martin's Work</strong>: Wonderful examples and great bird design.</li>

<li><strong>Dave's Presentation</strong>: Clean, though construction lines would be helpful.</li>

<li><strong>Darren and Sniggy's Studies</strong>: Solid village design that feels inhabited.</li>

<li><strong>Rachel's Critique</strong>: Overlapping buildings add depth and clarity.</li>

</ul>

<p>Recap of key points from the critiques: Maintain three-dimensionality, clear plane changes, and effective use of distortion. Practice form manipulation for better understanding. The next session will focus on gestural torsos.</p>
