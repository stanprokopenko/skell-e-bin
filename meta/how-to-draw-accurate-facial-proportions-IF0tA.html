<p>In this lesson, I'll focus on the general placement of facial features in both male and female faces, using the Loomis method as a foundation. We've gone in-depth on individual features like the nose, eyes, lips, and ears in previous sections. Now, it's time to see how they all fit together in proper proportions from the front and profile views.</p>

<h2>Male Face Proportions</h2>

<h3>Front View</h3>

<h4>Constructing the Face</h4>

<p>I start with a simple sphere to represent the <strong>cranium</strong>. Using the symmetry tool in Photoshop helps keep things balanced. I cut the sphere in half horizontally to find the <strong>brow line</strong>. From there, I measure down to the base of the sphere, which gives me the <strong>base of the nose</strong>. This distance represents the upper two-thirds of the skull.</p>

<p>Dividing the face vertically and horizontally helps establish the <strong>T-line</strong>, essential for maintaining symmetry. The face is divided into three equal parts:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Top third</strong>: From the <strong>crown of the head</strong> down to the <strong>brow line</strong>.</li>

<li><strong>Middle third</strong>: From the <strong>brow line</strong> to the <strong>base of the nose</strong> (and the base of the ears).</li>

<li><strong>Bottom third</strong>: From the <strong>base of the nose</strong> to the <strong>chin</strong>.</li>

</ul>

<p>I find the <strong>eye line</strong> by going one-third of the way down from the brow line to the base of the nose.</p>

<p>Next, I shave off a bit of the sphere on the sides to indicate the <strong>side planes of the head</strong>. This helps in placing the <strong>ears</strong>, which start at the brow line and extend down to the base of the nose.</p>

<h4>Facial Features Placement</h4>

<ul>

<li>

<p><strong>Eyes</strong>: The space between the eyes is approximately the width of one eye. The <strong>tear ducts</strong> generally align vertically with the sides of the nostrils. I draw a connected curved line to start the upper eyelid, keeping in mind that the tear duct is set lower than the outer corner of the eye.</p>

</li>

<li>

<p><strong>Nose</strong>: I use the <strong>keystone shape</strong> to represent the glabella and block out the eye sockets from there.</p>

</li>

<li>

<p><strong>Mouth</strong>: The <strong>lip line</strong> is one-third of the way down from the base of the nose to the chin. The corners of the mouth usually align vertically with the centers of the eyes.</p>

</li>

<li>

<p><strong>Ears</strong>: The ears align horizontally from the brow line to the base of the nose. Remember, the top portion of the ear grows out from the side of the head at an upward angle, about 45 degrees.</p>

</li>

<li>

<p><strong>Hairline</strong>: Approximately one-third of the way down from the crown to the brow line.</p>

</li>

</ul>

<h4>Adding Details</h4>

<p>I refine the jawline, adjusting it as needed for proportions. From the ears, I draw lines to indicate the <strong>cheekbones</strong> and the planes of the cheeks. The <strong>neck muscles</strong> (sternocleidomastoids) attach from behind the ears down to the pit of the neck.</p>

<p>I emphasize the <strong>asymmetrical design of the eyes</strong>. It's important to capture the subtle differences between the eyes for a natural look. Also, I ensure the lips' corners line up properly with the pupils.</p>

<p>Finally, I add the <strong>Adam's apple</strong> to the neck and sketch in the <strong>trapezius muscles</strong> to complete the male figure's front view.</p>

<h3>Profile View</h3>

<h4>Constructing the Profile</h4>

<p>Using the same proportional lines from the front view, I construct the profile. I start with a sphere for the cranium and add the facial plane in front. The brow line remains consistent, as does the base of the nose.</p>

<p>I block in the jawline, ensuring there's enough space for the <strong>back of the head</strong>. The neck isn't straight up and down but rather curves slightly forward, connecting to the base of the skull.</p>

<h4>Facial Features Placement</h4>

<ul>

<li>

<p><strong>Eye</strong>: Placed along the eye line. The front of the eyeball aligns vertically with the corner of the mouth.</p>

</li>

<li>

<p><strong>Nose</strong>: Extends outward from the glabella. From the profile, you can see a bit of the nostril on the far side.</p>

</li>

<li>

<p><strong>Mouth</strong>: The upper lip generally overlaps the lower lip slightly. The mouth aligns with the eye in the profile view.</p>

</li>

<li>

<p><strong>Ear</strong>: Placed between the brow line and base of the nose. I include details like the helix, antihelix, tragus, and concha.</p>

</li>

<li>

<p><strong>Hairline</strong>: Slopes down towards the back, starting from the forehead.</p>

</li>

</ul>

<h4>Neck and Hairline</h4>

<p>The <strong>neck muscles</strong>, particularly the sternocleidomastoids, attach behind the ear at the mastoid process and converge at the pit of the neck. Remember, the neck follows the curvature of the spine and connects to the base of the skull.</p>

<h2>Female Face Proportions</h2>

<h3>Front View</h3>

<h4>Constructing the Face</h4>

<p>I start again with a sphere for the cranium, shaving off the sides for the side planes. The same division into thirds applies:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Top third</strong>: Crown to brow line.</li>

<li><strong>Middle third</strong>: Brow line to base of nose.</li>

<li><strong>Bottom third</strong>: Base of nose to chin.</li>

</ul>

<p>The <strong>hairline</strong> is about one-third down from the crown to the brow line. The <strong>lip line</strong> is one-third down from the base of the nose to the chin.</p>

<p>I use softer curves to create a more feminine, elegant feel, especially in the jawline and chin.</p>

<h4>Facial Features Placement</h4>

<ul>

<li>

<p><strong>Eyes</strong>: Placed along the eye line, with attention to the asymmetrical design. The tear ducts are set slightly lower than the outer corners of the eyes. I add a few eyelashes to enhance the feminine look.</p>

</li>

<li>

<p><strong>Nose</strong>: A small bulb is indicated for the tip, with softer lines. The keystone shape of the glabella is taller and has more verticality.</p>

</li>

<li>

<p><strong>Mouth</strong>: The corners of the mouth align with the centers of the eyes. The lips are fuller, with a softer cupid's bow.</p>

</li>

<li>

<p><strong>Ears</strong>: Placed between the brow line and base of the nose, with a more delicate shape.</p>

</li>

</ul>

<h4>Feminine Features</h4>

<ul>

<li>

<p><strong>Cheekbones</strong>: Higher and more pronounced than in males, often wider.</p>

</li>

<li>

<p><strong>Chin and Jawline</strong>: Softer and less angular, with a minimized chin.</p>

</li>

<li>

<p><strong>Neck</strong>: More slender, with subtler neck muscles.</p>

</li>

</ul>

<p>I soften the edges on the cheeks and avoid heavy lines to maintain a delicate appearance.</p>

<h3>Profile View</h3>

<h4>Constructing the Profile</h4>

<p>Using the front view proportions, I construct the profile with a sphere for the cranium and add the facial plane. I ensure there's enough space at the <strong>back of the head</strong>. The neck flows gently from the head with a softer curve.</p>

<h4>Facial Features Placement</h4>

<ul>

<li>

<p><strong>Eye</strong>: Aligned with the eye line, set back slightly.</p>

</li>

<li>

<p><strong>Nose</strong>: Softer bridge with less pronounced nasal bone. A bit of the nostril is visible from the side.</p>

</li>

<li>

<p><strong>Mouth</strong>: The upper lip overlaps the lower lip slightly. The mouth doesn't extend back too far, stopping where the eye begins.</p>

</li>

<li>

<p><strong>Ear</strong>: Placed similar to the male, between the brow line and base of the nose, but with a smaller, more delicate shape.</p>

</li>

<li>

<p><strong>Hairline</strong>: More rounded, starting further down the forehead.</p>

</li>

</ul>

<h4>Neck and Hairline</h4>

<p>The neck muscles are less pronounced, and the neck is thinner. The <strong>hairline</strong> on the neck angles up towards the ears. I often add a ponytail or bun to suggest pulled-back hair, emphasizing the skull's shape.</p>

<h2>General Notes on Proportions</h2>

<ul>

<li>

<p><strong>Symmetry</strong>: Using tools or techniques to ensure facial symmetry is crucial, especially when drawing front views.</p>

</li>

<li>

<p><strong>Thirds Division</strong>: Dividing the face into equal thirds helps in accurately placing features:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Top third</strong>: Crown to brow line.</li>

<li><strong>Middle third</strong>: Brow line to base of nose (and ears).</li>

<li><strong>Bottom third</strong>: Base of nose to chin.</li>

</ul>

</li>

<li>

<p><strong>Eye Placement</strong>: The space between the eyes is roughly the width of one eye. The eye line is one-third down from the brow line to the base of the nose.</p>

</li>

<li>

<p><strong>Feature Alignment</strong>:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Eyes and Mouth</strong>: Corners of the mouth align vertically with the centers of the eyes.</li>

<li><strong>Nose and Eye</strong>: The sides of the nose align with the tear ducts.</li>

<li><strong>Ears</strong>: Top aligns with the brow line, bottom aligns with the base of the nose.</li>

</ul>

</li>

<li>

<p><strong>Neck Curvature</strong>: The neck isn't straight but has a slight forward curve, following the spine's natural shape. It connects to the base of the skull at the mastoid process behind the ear.</p>

</li>

<li>

<p><strong>Hairline Variation</strong>:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Male</strong>: Often has a more pronounced widow's peak and angles downward.</li>

<li><strong>Female</strong>: Generally more rounded and starts lower on the forehead.</li>

</ul>

</li>

<li>

<p><strong>Cheekbones</strong>:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Male</strong>: Less pronounced, with angular jaws.</li>

<li><strong>Female</strong>: Higher and more pronounced cheekbones, softer jawline.</li>

</ul>

</li>

<li>

<p><strong>Chin and Jawline</strong>:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Male</strong>: Stronger, more angular chin and jawline.</li>

<li><strong>Female</strong>: Softer, minimized chin, with a rounder jawline.</li>

</ul>

</li>

<li>

<p><strong>Neck Thickness</strong>:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Male</strong>: Thicker neck with more pronounced muscles.</li>

<li><strong>Female</strong>: Thinner neck with subtler musculature.</li>

</ul>

</li>

</ul>

<p>Remember, these are general guidelines. Individual faces vary greatly, and understanding these proportions helps in identifying and emphasizing unique features in different face types. Practice analyzing different faces to see how they deviate from these norms, which can be especially helpful in character design or caricature.</p>
