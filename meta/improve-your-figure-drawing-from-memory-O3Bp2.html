<p>Welcome back, everybody. Today, I'm tackling the Visual Memory Games Level Two assignment. I'll be drawing the mannequinized figure and exploring three different visual memory games. These exercises are designed to improve our visual memory and our ability to draw from imagination.</p>

<h2>Exercise 1: Drawing from Memory</h2>

<p>The first exercise is straightforward: <strong>look at the pose, remember it, put it away, and draw from memory</strong>. It's the most basic but essential way to train our visual recall.</p>

<h3>Analyzing the Pose</h3>

<p>When I first look at the pose, I focus on:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>The gesture and rhythms</strong>: I note any major rhythms defining the pose, like the flow from her right shoulder across to the knee and down to the foot.</li>

<li><strong>Proportions and landmarks</strong>: For instance, her right knee is a bit higher than her belly button, and her foot aligns between her knee and the bottom of her hips.</li>

<li><strong>Alignment and angles</strong>: The left side of her torso aligns with the right side of her calf, indicating how angled her torso is.</li>

<li><strong>Body type</strong>: She has a narrow and long torso and legs.</li>

</ul>

<p>I also take a few quick measurements:</p>

<ul>

<li>From the top of her head to the glutes equals the distance from the glutes down to her foot, up to where her underwear ends on her left leg.</li>

</ul>

<p>While these logical cues help, the goal is to <strong>improve visual memory visually</strong>. So, I try not to rely solely on measurements but also <strong>observe the basic forms and shapes</strong>.</p>

<h3>Drawing from Memory</h3>

<p>After studying the pose, I put the reference away and start drawing:</p>

<ol>

<li><strong>Establishing proportions</strong>: I mark the top of the head and the foot, using the measurements I remembered.</li>

<li><strong>Capturing the gesture</strong>: I sketch the rhythms and angles lightly, ensuring I can adjust as needed.</li>

<li><strong>Building the mannequin</strong>: I begin to draw the simplified forms, like boxes and cylinders, to represent the torso, limbs, and head.</li>

<li><strong>Adding limbs and features</strong>: I draw the legs coming towards us, foreshortened, and indicate the arms, even if I don't remember their exact positions.</li>

<li><strong>Refining the drawing</strong>: I adjust proportions and forms as I go, keeping in mind the visual memory of the pose.</li>

</ol>

<h3>Comparing with the Reference</h3>

<p>After finishing, I bring the reference back to compare:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Overall accuracy</strong>: The drawing is close in terms of pose and proportions.</li>

<li><strong>Areas for improvement</strong>: I notice I leaned her back slightly more and swung her leg out to the side more than in the reference.</li>

</ul>

<p>Remember, the goal isn't perfection but to <strong>learn from the mistakes</strong> and <strong>improve our visual memory</strong>.</p>

<h2>Exercise 2: Drawing from a Different Angle</h2>

<p>For the second exercise, I:</p>

<ol>

<li><strong>Look at the reference and draw it from the same angle</strong>.</li>

<li><strong>Put away the reference and draw it again from a different angle</strong>.</li>

</ol>

<p>This initial drawing helps me <strong>understand the forms better</strong>, which is crucial when changing the angle.</p>

<h3>Studying the Forms</h3>

<p>While drawing from the reference, I focus on:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Understanding the three-dimensional shapes</strong>: I think in terms of boxes, cylinders, and spheres.</li>

<li><strong>Visualizing cross-contours</strong>: This helps me grasp how the forms turn in space.</li>

<li><strong>Noting key relationships</strong>: Like how her heel is right under her glute.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Drawing from a Different Angle</h3>

<p>With the reference put away, I attempt to draw the pose from another angle:</p>

<ol>

<li><strong>Imagining the new viewpoint</strong>: I decide on a front three-quarter view.</li>

<li><strong>Reconstructing the forms</strong>: I start with the box of the hips and build the torso, considering the extreme lean and twist.</li>

<li><strong>Positioning the limbs</strong>: I recall the placement of the legs and arms, adjusting them for the new angle.</li>

<li><strong>Adjusting overlaps and foreshortening</strong>: I deal with the complexities of forms overlapping and receding.</li>

<li><strong>Adding the head</strong>: I place the head according to the new perspective, indicating her gaze.</li>

</ol>

<h3>Reflecting on the Drawing</h3>

<p>This exercise is quite challenging:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Difficulties faced</strong>: The extreme angles and overlaps made it tough to visualize.</li>

<li><strong>Learning points</strong>: Despite not being completely happy with the drawing, going through the motions was valuable.</li>

<li><strong>Acknowledging imperfections</strong>: Not every drawing will be perfect, but <strong>the process strengthens visual memory</strong>.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Exercise 3: Changing Angle and Proportions</h2>

<p>In the third exercise, I:</p>

<ol>

<li><strong>Study the photo and put it away</strong>.</li>

<li><strong>Draw it from a different angle and with different proportions</strong>.</li>

</ol>

<p>Changing proportions adds complexity because it affects the body's relationships and angles.</p>

<h3>Studying the Pose</h3>

<p>I observe:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Overall stance</strong>: A straight-on view with a C-curve in the torso.</li>

<li><strong>Leg positions</strong>: Her right leg is straight down with a slight bend, her left leg goes back, and she's on her toes.</li>

<li><strong>Arm placement</strong>: Elbows in slightly, wrists forward, right shoulder down more.</li>

<li><strong>Head orientation</strong>: She's looking to her left a bit.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Drawing with Altered Proportions</h3>

<p>Putting the reference away, I begin to draw:</p>

<ol>

<li><strong>Deciding on new proportions</strong>: I opt for a thicker, heavier torso with shorter legs.</li>

<li><strong>Choosing the angle</strong>: A front three-quarter view, looking up at her.</li>

<li><strong>Constructing the forms</strong>: I start with blobs to capture the mass, then refine into boxes and cylinders.</li>

<li><strong>Adjusting limbs</strong>: I adapt the leg and arm positions to fit the new proportions and angle.</li>

<li><strong>Designing elements</strong>: I invent details like hand gestures, aiming for a dynamic pose.</li>

</ol>

<h3>Evaluating the Outcome</h3>

<p>After comparing with the reference:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Observations</strong>: The torso could have leaned down more, and the feet placement could be adjusted.</li>

<li><strong>Successes</strong>: Despite changes, the drawing conveys a similar pose and was enjoyable to create.</li>

<li><strong>Importance of design</strong>: This exercise emphasizes combining memory with design decisions.</li>

</ul>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p>These visual memory exercises are challenging but <strong>incredibly valuable</strong>. They enhance our ability to draw from imagination and improve our understanding of forms.</p>

<p>To truly benefit:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Practice regularly</strong>: Incorporate these exercises into your routine, just like gesture drawing.</li>

<li><strong>Embrace mistakes</strong>: They're opportunities to learn and improve.</li>

<li><strong>Focus on understanding</strong>: Aim to grasp the forms and movements, not just replicate.</li>

</ul>

<p>Thank you for watching and sticking to the end. In the next session, we'll dive into critiques and then move on to the <strong>shading section</strong> of the course. See you then!</p>
