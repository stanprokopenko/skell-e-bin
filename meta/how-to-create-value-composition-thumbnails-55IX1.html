<h2>Starting with a Basic Thumbnail</h2>

<p>I'm diving into some value composition studies, focusing on <strong>thumbnail variations</strong>. I like to begin with a <strong>simple, "boring" thumbnail</strong> that's close to the reference photo. This acts as a warmup and helps me understand the major shapes and value groups without making significant changes right away.</p>

<p>I sketch out the <strong>big shapes</strong>, the head, the hands, and the general silhouette. I'm not concerned with details at this stage. I focus on simplifying and getting my <strong>simplifying muscles</strong> warmed up. I fill in the <strong>mid-tone background</strong>, ensuring it's not too clean or too messy. The goal is to communicate the value clearly, without spending too much time.</p>

<p>I pay attention to the <strong>dark areas</strong>, like the subject's shirt, which is very dark in the photo. I fill it in, recognizing that <strong>working small</strong> can be beneficial. It allows me to <strong>design shapes efficiently</strong> without getting bogged down by filling large areas.</p>

<h2>Experimenting with Value Variations</h2>

<p>In the next thumbnail, I decide to <strong>change the value of the shirt</strong>. Instead of keeping it dark, I make it lighter to see how it affects the composition. I introduce <strong>shadows within the shirt</strong>, like those under the collar and from the hands. I minimize contrast in certain areas to <strong>direct attention</strong> where I want it.</p>

<p>I also play with the <strong>background values</strong>, adding dark shapes behind the head to <strong>frame the subject</strong>. I adjust the values in the hair and face, deciding whether to keep them similar or differentiate them. I'm exploring how these changes influence the overall feel of the image.</p>

<h2>Modifying the Background and Hair Values</h2>

<p>I experiment further by making the <strong>hair lighter</strong> and the <strong>background darker</strong> to make the hair stand out. I fill the entire background with a dark tone, which creates a strong contrast with the light hair. I adjust the face's values, making it mostly mid-tones with fewer highlights.</p>

<p>I realize that the <strong>hands should be mid-value</strong> to prevent them from drawing too much attention away from the face. I'm aiming for a <strong>low-key drawing</strong> where the emphasis is on the hair and face, surrounded by darker tones.</p>

<h2>Emphasizing the Hands</h2>

<p>I want to explore a composition where the <strong>hands are more prominent</strong>. I consider increasing the contrast around the hands but don't want to diminish the importance of the face. I experiment by adding mid-tones around the hands to <strong>frame them</strong> without introducing too much contrast.</p>

<p>I adjust the <strong>shadow shapes</strong> to create a <strong>diagonal movement</strong> that leads the eye towards the hands. I play with the values, ensuring that the dark areas don't feel distracting or out of place.</p>

<h2>Playing with Cropping and Composition</h2>

<p>Finally, I focus on the <strong>cropping and framing</strong> of the composition. I add more space above the subject, which <strong>drops him lower</strong> in the frame and creates an interesting dynamic. Alternatively, I add more space below, bringing the hands to the center, which also works well.</p>

<p>I consider using a <strong>gradation in the shirt</strong>, transitioning from dark to mid-value, and adjust the background accordingly. I explore various shapes and edges, understanding that even with <strong>hard edges</strong>, I can imply soft transitions in value.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p>Through these <strong>thumbnail studies</strong>, I see how many directions a composition can take. By adjusting values, shapes, and cropping, I can dramatically alter the <strong>focus and feel</strong> of the piece. It's a process of exploration, and even though I could spend more time refining, these studies provide valuable insights into <strong>value composition</strong>.</p>
