<h2>Eye Level Skill Building</h2>

<p>Hi there! We're here to explore the assignments you submitted on <strong>eye level and perspective drawing</strong>. Many of you took on some of the most challenging exercises so far, like the <strong>twisting arrow</strong>, the <strong>curving arrow</strong>, and the <strong>floating anvil</strong>.</p>

<p>One of the key lessons was how shifting your viewpoint slightly can dramatically change your perception of a scene. For example, moving your view to the right causes the booth walls to shift: one wall foreshortens while the other expands. Objects that were distant seem closer, and the floor area changes.</p>

<p>Understanding how <strong>eye level</strong> affects your drawing is crucial. It's not just about looking up or down, it's about noticing the <strong>big differences</strong> that occur with slight changes in perspective.</p>

<h2>Timed Sketches and Letting Go of Perfection</h2>

<p>Many of you experimented with <strong>timed sketches</strong>, focusing on quick decision-making rather than perfecting every detail. This approach helps build your intuition and prevents you from getting bogged down in corrections.</p>

<p>For instance, Vera did a fantastic job noticing big differences without getting sidetracked by small inaccuracies. It's important to <strong>resist the temptation to finish</strong> every little detail and instead focus on the process and overall effect.</p>

<h2>Swiveling Views and Vanishing Points</h2>

<p>Some of you, like Randy, experimented with changing perspectives, such as looking up or down in a room. It's essential to understand how <strong>vanishing points</strong> work and how they affect your drawing.</p>

<p>Be cautious when placing vanishing points within the framed borders, as this can cause distortions, especially with two-point perspectives. Remember, bringing in a lower vanishing point requires lifting the horizon line significantly.</p>

<h2>Measuring and Maintaining Proportions</h2>

<p>Maintaining correct proportions can be challenging. Liesel asked how to keep the scale similar when reimagining a scene. The answer isn't always straightforward, but practice and measuring can help.</p>

<p>In one example, we tried to find where the highest point of a couch aligns with a leaning ladder. This required careful measuring and understanding of how to move points within the perspective grid. Sometimes, it takes multiple steps and can be complex, but it's a valuable exercise in improving accuracy.</p>

<h2>Freehand Drawing vs. Using Tools</h2>

<p>There's value in doing drawings <strong>freehand</strong> instead of relying heavily on tools like rulers. Freehand drawing helps develop your style and builds long-term freedom in drawing.</p>

<p>Carlos mentioned that sketching outlines freehand is quicker and often better for these exercises. Pamela's work exemplifies how freehand techniques can add a personal touch, making the drawing feel more authentic.</p>

<h2>Style and Personal Approach</h2>

<p>Your personal <strong>style</strong> comes through in how you tackle these assignments. Joi's work, for example, has a distinct style that's simple yet effective. It's essential to find your own voice and resist the urge to copy others, focusing instead on the fundamental principles.</p>

<h2>Importance of Viewpoint in Storytelling</h2>

<p>Understanding how eye level and perspective influence storytelling is vital. As William pointed out, looking up at a character can make them appear more powerful, while looking down can have the opposite effect. Children's books often use the child's eye level to create a relatable experience.</p>

<p>As artists, knowing where to place the viewer's eye level allows us to convey the desired emotion and focus in our work.</p>

<h2>Advanced Challenges: Twisting and Curving Arrows, Anvils</h2>

<p>Many of you went above and beyond by tackling the <strong>twisting arrow</strong>, <strong>curving arrow</strong>, and <strong>anvil</strong> exercises. These are advanced challenges that require a solid understanding of perspective.</p>

<p>Rovy and others showed impressive explorations of twisted arrows. Rupert found it difficult to transition smoothly but discovered that 2D slices helped. Maria created a <strong>Mobius strip</strong> and an animated version, which is fantastic!</p>

<p>These exercises push your skills further and help solidify your understanding of complex forms in space.</p>

<h2>What's Next: Understanding Vanishing Points and Closeup Views</h2>

<p>In the upcoming lessons, we'll dive into how to know exactly where the <strong>vanishing points</strong> go and how to create exact squares in perspective. We'll explore the science behind perspective as well as the creative aspects.</p>

<p>We'll also touch on <strong>closeup and wide-angle views</strong>, learning how to use them effectively in your drawings. This will set the foundation for making deliberate choices in your compositions and enhancing the impact of your work.</p>

<p>See you soon!</p>
