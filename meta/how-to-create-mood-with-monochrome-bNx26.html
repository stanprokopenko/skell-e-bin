<p>Now that we have a few methods of controlling color temperature, choosing colors, and understanding light and shadow, we're ready to take the next step and apply that knowledge to actual paintings. We'll start very simple, and I'll show you how to use different palettes in your work. Palettes allow you to play with different moods and feels in your painting, which is ultimately what we want to do as artists. So let's get started.</p>

<p>A <strong>palette</strong> is the full range of color that you are allowed to use in a painting. As an artist, there are no rulesâ€”you can use any palette you like. However, artists throughout history have discovered that it's often very helpful to limit your palette and not allow every color under the rainbow into your paintings. We're going to start with a <strong>limited palette</strong>.</p>

<p>The key thing about a palette is that you are allowed a range of warm to cool. If every color is just the same temperature, that's essentially a grayscale painting or maybe a colored grayscale painting. This first palette we're going to use does just use one color, but it still allows for a range of warm to cool. This palette is called a <strong>monochromatic palette</strong>. That's one hue, monochrome, but within that hue, we are allowed to use its full range of saturation.</p>

<p>A monochromatic palette will bring the strong presence of a single hue to your picture. Your picture will look overall blue or red or orange or whatever hue you want to base it on. Depending on your personal aesthetic, different colors might seem to match different subject matters or bring different emotions to the table. So a monochromatic palette is a very simple way of injecting some emotion into your picture based on how you respond to color.</p>

<h2>Setting Up the Workspace</h2>

<p>I've gone ahead and grabbed a sphere from one of John's lessons. A simple sphere, in my opinion, is a great object to practice with. It's easy to draw, and its form is easy to understand. I'll use the exact same lighting in this color demonstration as John outlined in his value demonstration. So that way, we'll pick up exactly where he left off.</p>

<p>Because this is a color painting, I want to start working directly with color. I don't want to start with black and white. I've traced out exactly what John's sphere was doing. As you can see, we have a line drawing of the sphere. This dotted line here represents the terminator, which is the division between light and shadow. This outline here is the shadow that the sphere is casting onto the table. And of course, the arrow here indicates our light direction.</p>

<p>As always, I find it helpful to define a little color chart, which I'll do here at the bottom. This color chart will become the palette of our painting.</p>

<h2>Creating a Monochromatic Palette</h2>

<p>Let's go back to our sphere and try a monochromatic palette. We've already seen a blue palette, so I'll make my palette based on red. All I have to do now is choose the red that I want. Let's just say a somewhat warmish red or a red on the warm side here. That is, it's closer to the warm area of the color wheel. So I'll pick a red about there.</p>

<p>Much like the painting we just saw, I want to use a full range of red. I'll put my maximum saturated red over here and then I'll incrementally reduce its saturation as I go to the left of my chart, which of course represents the cool side. Using colors all the way to essentially a perfect zero saturated gray. There we go. This will be the palette for my painting.</p>

<p>Remember, I've drawn my chart here with all the same value. In practice, let's say I pick a red here. Well, I'm allowed to use that red in all of its value. Any red can do that. I can pick a very saturated red, and I have access to all of its value. Value changes are another way of adding complexity to a palette. That is, within this one color, because I have a full range of values with every level of saturation, this simple monochromatic palette can still look quite sophisticated.</p>

<h2>Painting the Sphere</h2>

<h3>Establishing the Environment</h3>

<p>Before we start painting, let me just show you what I've got set up layers-wise. I've got my background as simply a color fill. My line drawing is on top of that. Now what I'll do with that line drawing is select a layer and change it to multiply mode. This will allow me to paint on the background and have the lines show through it. This is a classic way of setting up a digital painting with your line drawing on top.</p>

<p>I'll make a choice of having my saturated red, my most saturated red, in the very background. And I'm going to keep things very painterly and brushy for now, only honing in on exact shapes and details later. Maybe I'll darken the value of that red actually so the ball in light can pop out from it. Notice I'm not undoing my strokes. I'm just painting right over things.</p>

<h3>Laying in the Base Color and Shadows</h3>

<p>Color-wise, a monochromatic palette is very easy to use because you can't make a color mistake. I just leave the hue here, and any of these colors are valid. So what I'll do with my ground area is maybe I'll lighten it up a bit because I'm imagining a light hitting the ground. So I'll lighten up my red. I'm also desaturating it, which immediately introduces the concept of color temperature into the piece.</p>

<p>Now let's find a base color for the sphere itself. For this, I'll make a new layer, which is above my background but under my line drawing. It's always helpful to name your layers. I'll name that one sphere. Now, because this is a sphere, what I could do is simply make a selection. In Photoshop, I'm holding Shift with the circular marquee tool, which allows me to make a perfect circle. I find it helpful to hide that moving selection. I hit the selection with Control H, but as you can see, as I scribble over my sphere, the selection is still intact. In fact, this is a good color to start with. Let's go with that.</p>

<p>It's very important to lay in your values now because, as we've talked about, values determine the form and light of what you're painting. So I have to make a decision here. What temperature is my light? Warm or cool? I'm going to choose to make my light a warm light, which means that in light, I'm going to be in the more saturated reds, and my shadows will be in the less saturated reds or cooler reds. So I'll go ahead and pick a dark value with a fairly desaturated red, and I'll use this to lay in my shadows. Darken that up a bit more. I'm going ahead and just painting this in using my terminator reference line there to denote exactly where light changes to shadow.</p>

<h3>Adding Halftones and Highlights</h3>

<p>Now I would like to paint outside that selection. So in Photoshop, I can push control D for deselect, or I can find it up here at select deselect. Now I'm allowed to paint anywhere else on the picture. I'll go ahead and use roughly that same color here just to continue painting. Notice I'm scribbling into things, but so long as this is shadow, that's okay. I want to just merge my shadows all together at this point because remember, the absence of the warm light and shadow is going to cool off those reds. So as long as I'm in the realm of a cooler red and the correct value, I can kind of mix these a little bit, and that's okay.</p>

<p>At this point, it's safe to go ahead and hide your line drawing, which you do by clicking the eyeball here. And we've got ourselves a little three-dimensional scene starting to happen right in front of our eyes. And this is fun, but there's still a lot of creative choices to be made as well as values to be added to that ball. I'm going to go back to my background layer and continue to tweak it. Maybe darkening the background here behind the ball and maybe being a little bit more clear with where my floor is. I also don't want to jump from a very saturated background to a very desaturated floor, so I'm kind of managing the transition a little bit.</p>

<p>Going back to our color chart, I want to use these intermediary reds instead of, you know, just jumping from this one all the way to that one. You want to fill in this middle area. You really want to make sure your painting uses the full range of color temperature because that is what will communicate to the viewer a believable sense of warm and cool.</p>

<p>There is a fancy art word for these strokes I'm making. It's called <strong>scumbling</strong>. Scumbling kind of looks like this. Think of it as directional scribbling or scribbling with a bit of structure to it. A lot of my painting is based on this type of brushwork, but of course, the type of brushwork you use is totally up to you. This is just how I feel comfortable painting.</p>

<p>I want to create a nice little hotspot for the ground where my ball is sitting. Remember that the light source is warm. So when light hits the ground, it'll also warm up that ground. Now I've laid in that little table or ground plane there as a bit of a cooler local color that is a less saturated color. So at this stage, I'm realizing that it looks a bit too cold for this light. So I'm warming it up a bit. And really what I'm concerned with here is just manipulating color temperatures, mixing warms in with cools, moving between those two train stops, remember, and just making sure that I'm getting a bit of a warm versus cool read here.</p>

<h3>Introducing Occlusion Shadows and Reflected Light</h3>

<p>Now, going back to the sphere layer, right now if I painted on that sphere layer, I could paint outside the ball. But I want to restrict my brushstrokes to just the ball itself. With Photoshop, I can click this button, which is the lock transparency button, which means if I paint, it only allows me to paint on pixels that are already on that layer. It's a very helpful tool that again, all digital painting apps will have this functionality.</p>

<p>Using this, I can modify what the ball in light looks like. Again, scumbling in various temperatures. Now, I do want this lit part of the ball to appear warmer. So I'll make sure I'm still in the saturated reds here, but I'm interested here in establishing my monochromatic palette of reds, introducing enough warms versus cools throughout to make it feel like it's got a full range of temperature.</p>

<p>The value I'm painting in light here is what John identified as the center light. I've kind of allowed that center light to be the average light, averaging throughout the entire light side of this ball. It's time now to add halftones. Now remember, a center light is a point. Where the light strikes perpendicular to the ball, it's the lightest part of the ball. From that point, the sphere is gradually turning away from the light, moving in this direction, and that whole range is populated with little gradients called halftones. But to keep your job simple as a painter, remember that a halftone only starts dramatically getting darker right around here. Right where the form is turning more significantly away from the light and almost meeting shadow. So typically, I like to focus my halftone work in that area.</p>

<p>I've gone ahead and chosen an airbrush from my brush list here. Now, because I'm still in the light, remember, halftones are part of the light. I still want to be in these warm reds, but I'll drop the value a little bit. And just work right into this area where the light is severely turning away, but still in light, turning into shadow. I can always hold the Alt key, which turns my mouse into a sample tool. I can sample colors I've already painted. I can use this to help smooth out this section of halftone. I can also sample into the shadows here and kind of make sure that my terminator line remains intact. And I'll just go ahead and kind of massage this area until I feel like the rendering of the ball value-wise is closer to correct.</p>

<p>As I do this, though, I'm still looking at my other values. I'll go back into my center light value. Maybe I'll think that it needs to be a bit brighter, so I'll lighten it up a little bit and paint that in. Still just using my airbrush. No big deal. The airbrush is quite appropriate for a sphere because a sphere is a round object. As a sphere's halftones progress down the ball, they will make very soft edges just by the nature of the form. So I'm kind of sampling my mixtures and softly painting them in. I can even jump over to my shadow side here and start playing with its color temperature. You know, having little micro ranges of warm to cool.</p>

<p>Let me explain what I mean by that. Going back to our color chart at the bottom, I don't just want my shadows to be there, and I don't just want my lights to be there. I want to play with little ranges. For example, my lights will be overall warmer, but I'm allowed to go here and here and here. And my shadows will be overall cooler, but I want to allow myself to go here and here and here and here. So long as you leave a bit of a gap between temperatures like this, playing with little micro ranges of warm to cool is a very appealing thing to do in a painting. So that's exactly what I'm doing here.</p>

<p>Now I'm working into my shadows, warming this tone up a little bit. But of course, still keeping the value correct. That is the key of everything. You got to keep your values correct, or else your form and light just won't look like form and light.</p>

<p>Now, in a moment here, I will add more values in shadow, namely the occlusion shadow and reflected light, which is the ambient light bouncing up from the ground or coming down from the sky. But I'm not quite ready for that yet. I'm still just building out my environment, extending this floor back a little bit so it appears that that sphere is really sitting on a surface. Remember, the name of the game is experimentation here. A monochromatic palette is great for that because you almost can't go wrong.</p>

<p>I've gone ahead and picked a more textured brush here, and I'm using it to just modify some of the background painting in a slightly cooler red back there. I figure this will help make the warm red ball kind of pop out more if I cool off this red by going less saturated as you can see in my color picker. I'm far less saturated than I was, but I'm painting it right over that saturated red. When you do that, your colors can gain a little bit of a buzz to them almost where the things are constantly feeling like they're shifting around and not just flatly color filled. In painting, that does tend to create a result that is a bit more close to nature. Nature, of course, not being based on color fills either. And I'll also make sure I've darkened that background sufficiently enough so that the ball pops out value-wise as well.</p>

<p>I can go back into the sphere now and continue to explore. This brush is a little too textured for me. So I've gone ahead and selected a slightly less textured brush here. Still has a bit of texture on it though. I'm here just working on my sphere, building up little shifts of halftone as the light moves away from that center light. At this point, I've turned off my lock transparency button on my sphere layer, which allows me to paint a little bit outside the lines. Which I find does help with a little bit of a painterly result here. Another thing that's closer to nature is things generally aren't perfectly hard-edged all the way around.</p>

<p>So our sphere is gaining form as I work these little tiny shifts. Our dark halftone here can maybe be a bit warmer, so I'll warm it up, paint it in. Notice I'm not undoing strokes, I'm just painting color temperatures over other color temperatures. If the sphere has a glossy material, say like a lacquered finish, it'll have a highlight. A highlight can be the lightest part of your painting. I'll pick something very close to white and put it in the area that directly reflects the light source. We knew the light was coming down this way, so that point is a direct reflection of the light source. Suddenly the ball feels shiny.</p>

<p>Let's go back into the shadow family now and start further building it up. The occlusion shadow value is kind of the opposite of a highlight. It's the darkest part of your shadow and much like a highlight, it gives you a lot of pop. I'm looking at our shadow, which is kind of grouped together right now, but I'm thinking about where exactly does that ball meet the ground? Well, I have my line drawing to tell me. What I can do is select the line drawing and reduce its opacity a little bit just so it's not so strong. Then go back to my sphere layer and paint in that occlusion shadow. Notice I've got a very dark kind of medium saturated color. On a personal note, I almost never make my occlusion shadows fully desaturated. They generally look better for some reason with a bit of color in them. So I'll go with this medium saturation, very dark red. And using a very soft brush, I'll start brushing in this occlusion shadow right where the sphere meets the table.</p>

<p>The line drawing actually makes this hard to see, so I'll turn that line drawing off now, and now we can really see the form start to happen in a painterly kind of way. Remember that occlusion shadow will actually come up into the ball a little bit too, because as that ball turns more aggressively under, there's less opportunity for that bounce light or ambient light or reflected light to get in there. So using my airbrush, which of course has very soft edges, I'm building up my occlusion shadow. What that leaves behind is the illusion of reflected light. These other shadow values I'm sampling now were part of my initial lay-in. But now that I've got my occlusion shadow in, they look like reflected light. And that's a good thing because that's exactly what the environment will be doing. Reflecting its light back up into the shadows of the ball.</p>

<p>Suddenly though, my shadows appear a little bit too out of context temperature-wise, and that's because the reflected light from this very red environment will warm up those shadows a little bit. For example, we've already determined my light is warm. So a warm light ray will come into the scene, bounce off the floor, and bounce back up into the ball. Another light ray might come in here, bounce off the floor here, and up into the ball over here. Those warm light rays will bounce into the cooler shadow and warm them up. Remember that the shadow started cooler because the shadow does not have the influence of that warm bully light. But when reflected light rays from a warm light enter the shadow, some of that bully comes back.</p>

<p>It's important to know, though, that reflected light is far weaker than a direct light. The bully loses a lot of strength when it bounces. So what I'll do is I'll pick the temperature I'm currently at with the shadows of my ball, lighten the value up a little bit for reflected light, make it a little bit warmer by going out this way. I'll turn on my lock transparent pixels</p>
