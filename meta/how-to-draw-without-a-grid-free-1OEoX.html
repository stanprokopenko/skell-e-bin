<h2>What's in Premium?</h2>

<p>Transitioning from grid-based to freehand drawing involves a shift in technique and mindset. In the premium lesson, you'll learn to work on a 16x12 inch board using a color photo viewed on a monitor. Key techniques include squinting to simplify shapes and using charcoal for its erasability. You'll develop visual judgment by focusing on negative space and landmarks to maintain proportions. The lesson covers measuring and placement without a grid, correcting mistakes early, and capturing likeness by focusing on specific features. These skills will enhance your ability to create accurate and lifelike drawings.</p>
