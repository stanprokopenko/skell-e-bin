<p>Choosing the right type of light source can have a huge impact on the mood of your piece. So how do these different types of light work? And how can you paint them correctly?</p>

<h2>Light Emission and Direction</h2>

<p>Let's say you have a light bulb. <strong>Light can be thought of as beams traveling outward from the light source</strong>. So your light bulb will be emitting light in all directions. Objects around the light bulb will be lit according to which plane is facing the light bulb.</p>

<h2>Light Falloff</h2>

<p>Additionally, there's a concept called <strong>light falloff</strong>, where objects further away from the light source become exponentially darker. If you double the distance of objects from the light bulb, they become dramatically darker. This gives you two important things to remember about light falloff:</p>

<ol>

<li><strong>Light falloff is dependent on the relative distance of the object to the light source</strong>.</li>

<li><strong>Light falloff is exponential</strong>.</li>

</ol>

<h2>Comparing the Light Bulb and the Sun</h2>

<p>You might be thinking, "In previous lessons, the light was always just coming from one angle, and you never mentioned light falloff." But don't worry, the rules haven't changed, they just have some nuance.</p>

<h3>The Sun as a Light Source</h3>

<p>If you look at the sun (not literally though, bad for your eyes), at a cosmic scale, the sun behaves exactly like our light bulb. It's a spherical light source, emitting light in all directions. What's different is that the sun is unfathomably bigger, brighter, and farther away from us compared to the light bulb.</p>

<p>Although the sun is emitting light in all directions, because of its size and distance, by the time you're looking at objects on Earth, the light is, for all intents and purposes, traveling in a single direction.</p>

<p><strong>Why doesn't light falloff happen with the sun?</strong> Well, it does, just not on a perceptible level here on Earth. Light falloff has to do with the brightness of the light source and the relative distance of the object to that light source. In order to get even 1% farther away from the sun than we are, you'd have to travel about 930,000 miles.</p>

<h2>Types of Light Sources</h2>

<p>With this understanding of the sun versus the light bulb, you can describe two of the most important light sources you can use in your paintings to create the right kind of mood.</p>

<h3>Strong, Distant Light Sources</h3>

<p>You can use a strong, distant light source like the sun, which is very even and consistent in its direction and brightness.</p>

<h3>Closer, Weaker Light Sources</h3>

<p>Or you can use weaker and closer light sources, which have more varied direction and are subject to falloff. Many paintings will use a combination of the two.</p>

<h2>Properties of Different Light Sources</h2>

<p>When you understand the properties of light, it becomes much easier to imagine how different light sources might work in your paintings.</p>

<ul>

<li>

<p><strong>Flashlight</strong>: A flashlight is a very bright light source, so it can travel quite a distance before being affected by falloff. Also, the light is blocked on all sides except the front-facing glass, so the beam expands outward as it travels.</p>

</li>

<li>

<p><strong>Candle</strong>: A candle is a weaker light source than a flashlight, so it'll fall off more quickly, but it travels in all directions and will light all nearby objects.</p>

</li>

</ul>

<p>No matter what kind of light source you're using, <strong>the rules of light always stay the same</strong>. The main things you always have to consider are:</p>

<ol>

<li><strong>How bright is the light source?</strong></li>

<li><strong>How close is the light source?</strong></li>

<li><strong>What direction is the light traveling in?</strong></li>

</ol>

<h2>Hard Light vs. Soft Light</h2>

<p>But there's one more parameter that you can throw into the mix: <strong>hard light versus soft light</strong>.</p>

<h3>Scattering and Translucent Surfaces</h3>

<p>Let's return to the sun as your light source. You know that it travels in one direction and creates hard-edged shadows, or <strong>hard light</strong>. But what about on a cloudy day? There's still plenty of light, but it doesn't seem to be coming from any one particular direction, and the shadows become very soft and subtle. This is <strong>soft light</strong>, and it's the result of <strong>scattering</strong>.</p>

<p>When light hits a partially transparent surface, which we call <strong>translucent</strong>, some of it bounces off, and some of it continues passing through, bouncing repeatedly and changing direction as it goes until it eventually re-emerges back into the open air. This means that by the time the sunlight reaches you on the ground, it's no longer coming from the direct angle of the sun, but rather from lots of different directions all at once.</p>

<p>In this scenario, you do still have a general lighting direction, the light is coming from above because the sun is still above you, but it's also coming from your right, left, in front of you, and behind you. The result of this scattered lighting is that all of your shadows become very soft edged. Hence the term <strong>soft lighting</strong>.</p>

<h3>Softening Shadows with Multiple Light Sources</h3>

<p>Remember how the softness of the form shadow on your planar sphere versus your smooth sphere was simply the number of transitional planes between them? This is basically the same principle that causes soft lighting, except in this case, it's not the number of planes, but rather the number of light sources that softens the edges.</p>

<p>If you create one light source coming directly from above, you get the same hard shadows that you've seen before. If you split this one light source into four light sources and spread them out, the form of the sphere is now being lit more evenly, and you have four cast shadows. If you split these light sources again to eight, the effect repeats. The form shadow of the sphere is even more evenly lit, and the multiple cast shadows begin to look like a soft edge. If you repeat this process enough, you eventually have soft lighting and soft shadows.</p>

<p>Compare the hard light of your single light source versus the soft light of your scattered light source, and you can clearly see the difference. With hard light, the form has a very clear light side and shadow side, and it casts a hard-edged shadow. With soft light, the form rolls almost imperceptibly towards shadows and may not have a true shadow side at all. The cast shadow is also completely soft-edged and fades seamlessly onto the form it's being cast upon.</p>

<p>This soft light, sometimes called <strong>ambient light</strong>, is what happens when light is scattered.</p>

<h2>Occlusion Shadows</h2>

<p>This kind of soft light also creates your final type of shadow: <strong>occlusion shadows</strong>. These are soft, dark shadows that appear where none of your scattered light sources can reach, and they often occur where two forms are touching each other.</p>

<h3>Where Light Can't Reach</h3>

<p>The general rule to keep in mind is that occlusion shadows appear where it's difficult for light to reach. Think of an open doorway on a cloudy day. There's no clear cast shadow, but the farther into the doorway you go, the harder it is for the light from the outside to reach the interior. Or think of grout lines between bricks. Since the bricks protrude outwards, it's difficult for the light to reach in between them to the recessed grout lines.</p>

<h3>Occlusion Shadows in Practice</h3>

<p>If you find objects in your paintings are looking floaty or not really grounded, they are probably lacking occlusion shadows. Occlusion shadows are not functionally different from cast shadows, they are just the result of soft light rather than hard light.</p>

<h2>Combining Hard and Soft Light</h2>

<p>Here's where things get a little bit tricky. There will be occlusion shadows in basically every painting that you do, even the ones primarily lit by hard light. Why is this? Because almost every realistic situation has both hard and soft lights involved.</p>

<h3>The Sky as a Secondary Light Source</h3>

<p>Let's take a person outside on a bright, sunny day. You know that the hard light of the sun will create hard-edged cast shadows, but there's also going to be soft light and occlusion shadows because there's a second, softer light source, <strong>the sky</strong>. This is the same kind of scattering that happened with your cloudy day, it's just a much more transparent surface. This scattering turns the sky into a gigantic, soft blue light source.</p>

<p>If you look at a portrait with just the sun's light, you can see the hard form and cast shadows you'd expect. If you look at the same portrait with just the sky's light, you see very soft shadows and occlusion shadows in the nostrils and lips. When you combine the two, you get a more realistic impression of outdoor lighting. It's also mostly visible in the shadow areas because the soft sky lighting is not nearly as bright as the direct light from the sun.</p>

<p>With the sun as a light source, scattering turns the sky into a secondary light source. And it also creates a third light source, which is one of the biggest keys to rich, vibrant lighting.</p>

<h3>Reflected Light from Surfaces</h3>

<p>Let's look at your figure with the sun and sky lights again. Now watch what happens when you put a floor underneath the figure. The shadow areas change completely, becoming much brighter and softer. <strong>The floor itself has become a secondary light source</strong> as the light from the sun hits the floor and bounces back upwards into your figure.</p>

<p>So with your daytime scene where the sun is the only thing actually emitting any light, you actually have three different light sources:</p>

<ol>

<li><strong>The direct light from the sun</strong></li>

<li><strong>The scattered light from the sky</strong></li>

<li><strong>The reflected light from the ground</strong></li>

</ol>

<p>This addition of reflected light is the key to making the lighting in your paintings look real and vibrant.</p>

<h2>Practical Application</h2>

<p>Let's take a closer look at what's going on with reflected light.</p>

<h3>Approximating Reflections in Your Paintings</h3>

<p>You know that when light hits a surface, it reflects off at the same angle. But that's not all. Some of the light's energy is absorbed by the surface, while the rest of it is reflected off. If you look at two parallel surfaces and shine a light, the light will reflect repeatedly between the two, losing energy or brightness with each reflection. This reflection accounts for a lot of the light in your world and in your paintings.</p>

<h3>Reflected Light in Interiors</h3>

<p>Here you have a room with no reflected light. You can see the direct light from the windows, but the rest of the room is black because the light isn't reflecting. You can improve this somewhat by adding the soft light from the sky, but the room still feels dark and unrealistic. If you have the light reflect just one time, immediately the scene feels more believable. The light hitting the floor illuminates the walls and ceilings, but there are still some unnaturally dark areas on the floor.</p>

<p>If you allow the light to reflect five times, the scene begins to feel realistic. The light shines in through the window and hits the floor, reflects off the floor and hits the ceiling, then reflects off the ceiling and hits the floor again. This repeats until the light has completely expended its energy.</p>

<h3>Painting Lighting from Scratch</h3>

<p>As always, this is complicated geometry, but you don't have to calculate it. If you understand how light works, you can make some very accurate guesses.</p>

<p>Let's see how you might solve this lighting in a painting. You start by defining your direct light. What is your light source hitting first? In this example, it's the window light on the floor. You then know that the light will reflect, but at what angle? The direct light is traveling downwards and slightly from your direction, so it will reflect upwards and slightly away from you. You can see it reflecting upwards as the light from the floor reflects onto the ceiling, and you can see it reflecting away from you as the light from the floor reflects onto the distant wall.</p>

<p>The first reflection is the most important and the most visible. Remember, <strong>light loses energy and brightness with each reflection</strong>, so although the second and third reflections do make a difference, they're going to be dramatically less impactful than the first one.</p>

<p>If you look at your interior one last time and imagine painting this from scratch, you can approximate that the direct light will most strongly reflect onto the wall and ceiling. After that, you can guess that some of the light from the ceiling will reflect back onto the floor. After those two primary reflections, you can assume there will be another dozen or so reflections at many different angles, which fill the space with soft light and create occlusion shadows.</p>

<p>Interiors are a very dramatic example of this effect, but it happens in all lighting situations. If you thoughtfully consider reflected light, your paintings will immediately become much more vibrant.</p>

<h2>Assignment</h2>

<p>With that, let's wrap up our overview of light and form. There's a lot more nuance than this, but these basics will keep you busy for a while.</p>
