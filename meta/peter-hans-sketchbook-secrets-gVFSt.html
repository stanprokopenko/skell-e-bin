<p>I'd like to share a journey through some of my sketchbooks, exploring how I approach sketching and drawing. Over the years, I've collected and filled many sketchbooks, each with its own purpose, character, and story. I'll start with some of my older sketchbooks and move towards my more recent ones, highlighting the experiences and processes behind them.</p>

<h2>The Strathmore Watercolor Sketchbook and the Dynamic Bible</h2>

<p>One of my older sketchbooks is the <strong>Strathmore Watercolor Sketchbook</strong>. This book holds special significance because it's where I began creating the <strong>Dynamic Bible</strong> back in 2016. The Dynamic Bible is a collection of my lecture notes and teaching methods from classes I taught at ArtCenter and other schools. For about six months, I collected all that data and compiled it into this sketchbook.</p>

<p>These pages are the originals, drawn directly with pen and watercolor. I scanned them and edited some of the text before printing them into the book. Initially, I hadn't intended to publish the Dynamic Bible. I created it for myself to see if people understood what I was teaching. But as I shared my work, people encouraged me to make it into a book. Eventually, I launched a Kickstarter and successfully published it.</p>

<p>In this sketchbook, you'll find studies on shape, form, observational sketching, and foundational concepts like line, movement, volume, texture, and surface. Many drawings were done on-site at places like the LA Natural History Museum or cafes. Even now, when I look back at these sketches, I still appreciate them. They remind me of where I was and how I felt at the time.</p>

<h2>The Midori Traveler's Journal</h2>

<p>Next, I want to share a smaller sketchbook with a specific application, the <strong>Midori Traveler's Journal</strong>. This leather-bound sketchbook is perfect for traveling. I collect all sorts of things in it, drawings, stickers, stamps, and notes. I take it with me everywhere, tucking it under my arm. It becomes a journal of my journeys.</p>

<p>In 2017, I traveled to places like Italy, Australia, and New Zealand. I filled the pages with observational drawings of fountains, pitcher plants at the Huntington Library, and insects at the LA Natural History Museum's Bug Fair. I even attended a taxidermy workshop where we prepared tarantulas, and I took detailed notes and drawings of the process.</p>

<p>I also collected materials like birch bark to draw on and included flora and fauna I found along the way. This sketchbook holds memories of dinners with friends, visits to Disneyland, and everyday observations. It even contains a mini sketchbook within it, complete with sketches and a little insect.</p>

<h2>Rice Paper Accordion Books</h2>

<p>I then experimented with <strong>rice paper accordion books</strong>. These sketchbooks open up like an accordion, and I had to adapt my approach to drawing in them. I wanted to make sure the imagery transitioned smoothly from one page to the next, creating a continuous flow.</p>

<p>In my first accordion book, I explored aquatic themes, studies of sculptures from my travels in Paris and Versailles, and observations of birds and ravens. I found myself transitioning from drawing birds to dinosaurs, then to cavemen, and even to historical figures from the Civil War. When I wasn't sure what to draw next, I turned to <strong>Godzilla</strong>, a recurring theme in my work.</p>

<p>These accordion books challenged me to think about how each image connected to the next. I didn't have a class on how to make sketchbooks or how to draw in them. I just had fun and learned through <strong>play</strong> and experimentation.</p>

<h2>The Etcher Accordion Book</h2>

<p>I moved on to another accordion book made by <strong>Etcher</strong>. I started with observations of airplanes, deconstructing them and playing with perspective and details. The imagery evolves across the pages, transitioning from mechanical to organic forms, from animals to mythical creatures.</p>

<p>One theme I explored was <strong>arm wrestling</strong>, which is surprisingly difficult to draw. It's challenging because you have to capture the dynamic tension and shifting dominance between opponents. I drew inspiration from manga like <strong>Battle Angel Alita</strong> and tried to capture the intensity of the matches.</p>

<p>I also dove into themes like monster characters, sports figures, and more <strong>Godzilla</strong> sketches. The accordion format allowed me to create a continuous narrative flow, pushing me to consider composition and transitions.</p>

<h2>Larger Format Sketchbooks</h2>

<p>I enjoy working with different sizes of sketchbooks. In Austria, I found a larger format sketchbook with excellent binding that allowed it to lay flat. The paper quality was fantastic, and I drew on the cover, which wraps around the spine to the back.</p>

<p>In this sketchbook, I studied <strong>Mongolian culture</strong>, did pen and marker studies, and explored various themes. I drew daily, filling hundreds of pages with figures, creatures, machines, and observational drawings. I often carry multiple sketchbooks and use them in rotation.</p>

<p>I prefer drawing on one side of the pages in case I want to use the drawings for printing later. Scanning becomes easier without images bleeding through from the other side. I invested a lot of time into this sketchbook, exploring interior and exterior perspectives to create immersion.</p>

<h3>Sketching with Fellow Artists</h3>

<p>I had the opportunity to meet and sketch with other artists like <strong>Kim Jung Gi</strong>, <strong>Carl Kopinski</strong>, and <strong>Katsuya Terada</strong>. They even drew in my sketchbook. Their energy and creativity inspired me to push myself further. Sketching alongside others can be incredibly motivating.</p>

<h2>My Approach to Sketching and Drawing</h2>

<p>My subject matter varies widely, figurative work, creatures, animals, machines, and more. For me, it's not the subject that matters most, but the <strong>very act of visualizing and drawing</strong>. I approach them all similarly using the dynamic sketching method.</p>

<p>I distinguish between <strong>sketching</strong> and <strong>drawing</strong>. Sketching is about understanding something, problem-solving through proportion, line, shape, and perspective. Drawing, or illustrating, is when I know what I want to create, and I focus on materials, themes, and visuals. In my larger format sketchbooks, I often create more polished illustrations.</p>

<p>I also experiment with different tools, like fountain pens and brush pens, and I rarely use pencils. Drawing directly with ink forces me to commit and be decisive.</p>

<h2>Finding Inspiration and Growth</h2>

<p>Observation plays a significant role in my work. I travel to places like Africa to observe animals like cheetahs and lions in the wild. These experiences inspire my drawings. For example, watching the famous <strong>five brother cheetahs</strong> in the Maasai Mara inspired me to draw runners stretching and preparing.</p>

<p>I also find inspiration in everyday objects. I drew characters based on familiar devices like the <strong>Game Boy</strong>, <strong>Nokia phone</strong>, <strong>Atari controller</strong>, and <strong>Tamagotchi</strong>, incorporating their shapes and elements into the designs.</p>

<p>When I feel something isn't working, I <strong>repeat and refine</strong> it until I'm satisfied. For instance, when drawing arm wrestling figures, I kept pushing the camera angle and foreshortening to capture the intensity. I believe in pushing myself and evolving.</p>

<p>Sometimes, inspiration won't leave me alone until I put it on the page. I have to express it, to <strong>expunge</strong> it onto the paper.</p>

<h2>Sketchbooks as Personal Journeys</h2>

<p>Each sketchbook is a personal journey, holding memories and experiences. They are like <strong>characters on my shelf</strong>, and I know each one intimately. Completing a sketchbook brings a sense of satisfaction and personal growth. I usually finish 10 to 12 sketchbooks a year.</p>

<p>I enjoy finding sketchbooks with character, often from small shops or independent creators. One of my favorites is a sketchbook from Italy made by <strong>Epica</strong>. It has hand-pressed paper with a unique texture. Although it was expensive, I believe in using the materials I buy. In this sketchbook, I focused on single imagery and illustrations.</p>

<h3>The Endless Sketchbook</h3>

<p>I also have a sketchbook I found in Utah, with no price tag or brand. It had a rough, handmade feel, and the paper was absorbent and textured. Drawing in it felt like building a relationship with the material. The sketchbook seems endless, and I love that it continues to challenge me.</p>

<h2>Observational Sketching and Travel Journals</h2>

<p>I keep travel sketchbooks, like the one from <strong>Midori</strong>, where I collect stickers, business cards, and other materials from my journeys. I make quick observational sketches of people on trains, in cafes, or at museums. These sketches are often done in five minutes or less.</p>

<p>When I travel to places like Japan, I collect stamps, tickets, and leaves. I draw inspiration from the environment, like scenes at the Imperial Palace gardens in Tokyo or the <strong>Ghibli Museum</strong>. One memorable sketch was inspired by two small insects I saw in a garden, which reminded me of Ghibli animations.</p>

<p>These sketchbooks show that my eyes are always observing and gathering. Even when I'm not drawing on the page, I'm <strong>drawing in my mind</strong>.</p>

<h2>Capturing Moments and Emotions</h2>

<p>Sometimes, my sketches are deeply personal. The day <strong>Kim Jung Gi</strong> passed away, I was preparing to leave for New York Comic Con. When I received the news, I stayed home and processed it. I drew an image imagining what he might have seen when he passed, incorporating elements from his experiences.</p>

<p>I believe it's important to have moments when you look back on your work and say, "<strong>I love it</strong>." One of my favorite drawings is of <strong>Ultraman</strong> battling a creature. I like it not just because of how it looks but because of how it felt when I created it, the movement, texture, and intensity.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p>My sketchbooks are a reflection of my experiences, observations, and growth as an artist. They hold memories of places I've been, people I've met, and things that have inspired me. Sketching and drawing are not just about creating art, they're about connecting with the world around me and continually evolving.</p>

<p>I encourage you to keep your own sketchbooks and to <strong>finish them</strong>. There's a unique satisfaction in completing a sketchbook and looking back at your journey. Each one becomes a part of you, a character on your shelf filled with stories and experiences.</p>

<p>Remember to <strong>observe</strong>, <strong>explore</strong>, and <strong>enjoy</strong> the process. Let your sketchbooks become a personal tour of your artistic journey.</p>
