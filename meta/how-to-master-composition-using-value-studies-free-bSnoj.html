<h2>What's in Premium?</h2>

<p>Learn how to simplify values in master paintings to study their compositions effectively. This lesson shows you how to reduce artworks to just two or three valuesâ€”light and dark, or light, mid, and dark. You'll explore techniques like squinting to identify big shapes, using gradient maps for digital analysis, and focusing on overall value composition instead of details. By examining examples from artists like Sorolla, Rockwell, and Sargent, you'll understand how to apply these methods to enhance your own art.</p>
