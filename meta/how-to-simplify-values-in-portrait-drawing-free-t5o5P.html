<h2>What's in Premium?</h2>

<p>In this lesson, you'll learn how to develop values in a portrait drawing by simplifying complex shapes into basic forms. Starting with big masses, the instructor guides you through unifying shadows and modeling the head using the "egg principle" to create the illusion of depth and form. You'll understand how to avoid visual traps caused by human perception limitations. The lesson demonstrates the effective use of tools like Pan Pastel, synthetic brushes, and erasers to create smooth transitions and add depth. This structured approach lays a solid foundation for realistic portrait drawing, preparing you for further lessons on edge work and finishing touches.</p>
