<h2>Materials and setup</h2>

<p>I’m using markers again for this last composition thumbnail demo. I’m going with the <strong>red gray set</strong> plus <strong>white</strong>. The set has three <strong>temperature grays</strong>:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Cool grays</strong>: slightly blue</li>

<li><strong>Warm grays</strong>: slightly yellow-brown</li>

<li><strong>Red grays</strong>: slightly reddish-brown</li>

</ul>

<p>They’re all muted grays from <strong>light to dark</strong>, with just a hint of color. I can mix any two with white, or use all three without white. I might also do the larger final with markers.</p>

<h2>Mindset for thumbnails</h2>

<p>I noticed in the previous one I tried to stay <strong>too clean</strong>. Using a ruler and keeping everything neat makes me hold back, avoid mistakes, and get uptight. That’s not good for exploration. I want to keep it <strong>loose but intentional</strong>. Not messy on purpose, just not distracted by cleanliness. If I mess up proportions, I’ll fix it in the next one.</p>

<h2>Initial value read</h2>

<p>It’s a <strong>bright shape in the middle</strong> and a <strong>very dark background</strong>. The bottom lights feel brighter because they’re warm against a cold background, but if I ignore temperature and look only at <strong>value</strong>, the <strong>top of the hat</strong> is actually very bright too. So both the top and bottom lights are bright. I’m going to <strong>crop right above the lower light source</strong>. I’m not adding story yet. No fireball or campfire. Just shapes and values.</p>

<h2>Thumbnail 1: Study the reference</h2>

<p>I mapped the figure fast: hat, head, hands out. No measuring. I’m just analyzing.</p>

<ul>

<li>There’s a <strong>cast shadow on the wall</strong> at the bottom left, likely from the cool top light. If he’s outside, that shadow wouldn’t be there, but for now I’m sticking to the reference.</li>

<li>I see a bit of a <strong>vignette</strong> with darker corners and a lighter middle in the background.</li>

<li>There are darks inside the figure too: under the jaw and chin.</li>

<li>He’s hunched. Shoulders are up by the ears. I’ll keep that in mind next time.</li>

<li>The drapery has a big <strong>diaper fold</strong> in the middle (draping between the two shoulders), and <strong>vertical folds</strong> along the sides. I’m keeping folds simple. The middle is blown out by the light, so no deep darks there.</li>

<li>The <strong>hands</strong> in the reference are darker than the top of the hat, but I’m going to <strong>cheat</strong> and keep them lighter so they don’t disappear against the background.</li>

</ul>

<p>This one uses three values: paper white, a mid, and a dark.</p>

<h2>Thumbnail 2: Full dark background, hands mid</h2>

<p>Now I’m trying a <strong>fully dark background</strong> to silhouette the figure.</p>

<ul>

<li>I mapped the figure broadly and dropped the background to black right away. It’s a <strong>strong, bold statement</strong> in two values already.</li>

<li>Then I filled the interior with a <strong>mid value</strong> for hat, face, drapery. I’ll add dark accents after.</li>

<li>I made the <strong>hands a mid value</strong> this time, so I added <strong>more dark around the hands and face</strong> to pop them.</li>

<li>Most of the drapery folds here are dark, getting lighter toward the bottom.</li>

</ul>

<p>I like this. Simple, clear silhouette with strong separation.</p>

<h2>Thumbnail 3: Dark only at the top</h2>

<p>I’m putting <strong>dark only at the top</strong> of the background to push contrast up there and see if it pulls the eye higher.</p>

<ul>

<li>Cropping still feels strong. I’m not falling in love with any one idea, but I like this.</li>

<li>If the <strong>hands are bright white</strong>, I can <strong>extend the mid</strong> in the background up past the hands, then keep the top dark to frame the head and shoulders.</li>

<li>I tested that. I’m not sure having no black at the bottom is ideal, but I like the clarity of the focal area at the top.</li>

</ul>

<p>Overall, all three are working, but if I had to drop one, I’d drop the first. These last two feel stronger.</p>

<h2>Thumbnail 4: Refine the split background, strengthen the silhouette</h2>

<p>I’m making the silhouette even clearer and being <strong>conservative with the darkest details</strong>. I’ll only place them where they really pop.</p>

<ul>

<li>I kept the background treatment from the last one.</li>

<li>I reduced midtones and darks inside the figure to <strong>strengthen the silhouette</strong>.</li>

<li>I kept the <strong>hands pure white</strong> for maximum contrast.</li>

<li>Only a few key mid and dark shapes at the top.</li>

</ul>

<p>Comparing the two similar versions:

- If the light shape <strong>travels up through the figure</strong> continuously, the <strong>whole body feels important</strong> and the silhouette stays powerful.

- If the light is <strong>split</strong> (bright bottom, halftone middle, bright top), that <strong>break</strong> weakens the silhouette and draws too much attention to the bottom.</p>

<p>I’m leaning toward the one where the light <strong>continues up</strong>, not split.</p>

<h2>Thumbnail 5: Top light as the main light</h2>

<p>What if the bottom warm light is <strong>not bright</strong>, just a deeper warm? Then the <strong>top light</strong> is the main light.</p>

<ul>

<li>I gave more <strong>air above the head</strong> and added a <strong>light shape at the top</strong> of the background with vertical strokes, like light coming down.</li>

<li>I needed some shape up there so the extra space feels intentional.</li>

</ul>

<p>I tried a version where that top light shape is a <strong>mid</strong> and <strong>continues down into the head</strong>. I didn’t like it. A smaller, separate light shape or ray felt better. Still, the earlier <strong>continuous light silhouette</strong> is the strongest.</p>

<h2>Choosing the winner</h2>

<p>The strongest is the version with:

- <strong>Dark framing</strong> at the top and sides

- <strong>Continuous bright light</strong> through the figure

- <strong>Hands pure white</strong>

- Minimal mid/dark inside the figure so the <strong>silhouette stays powerful</strong></p>

<p>I’m going to do a larger version of that one.</p>

<h2>Larger study: 4 values, simple and clear</h2>

<p>I put a scrap sheet underneath so I don’t bleed on other pages. I’m aiming for <strong>4 values</strong>: paper white, a light mid, a darker mid, and black. I have a <strong>3 and 5</strong> plus black. I could add a 7 as a fifth value, but I’ll hold off unless I really need it.</p>

<p>Note on numbering: in our lessons, zero is black. In these markers, <strong>zero is white</strong>. Everyone’s system is different. It’s made up anyway.</p>

<h3>Block-in and value control</h3>

<ul>

<li>I dropped in the <strong>black background</strong> first.</li>

<li>Since I have an extra light value to work with now, I might bring the <strong>hands down to a light mid</strong> instead of pure white.</li>

<li>I’m <strong>layering</strong> the darker mid (5) so it stays clearly darker than the lighter mid (3). A double layer of 3 and a single layer of 5 can look too close, so I’m stacking layers of 5 and keeping 3 to single passes.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Shapes and details</h3>

<ul>

<li>Inside the figure, I’m staying <strong>minimal</strong> to protect the silhouette.</li>

<li>The <strong>face</strong> is mostly in shadow. I like it <strong>mysterious</strong>, looking downward.</li>

<li>I added a few <strong>darkest accents</strong> for features on the face.</li>

<li>I introduced the <strong>fourth value</strong> to add subtle detail in the big light shape, especially around the shoulders and hat so they feel a touch darker than the blown-out light below.</li>

<li>I used <strong>second layers</strong> of black and the mid to create a <strong>pseudo fifth value</strong> in a few spots, like the corners near the hands, to make them pop more.</li>

</ul>

<p>I kept it asymmetrical and avoided overcomplicating. I’m happy with it.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p>It’s not wildly different from the photo, but I made a lot of <strong>intentional decisions</strong>:

- Background design

- Where the <strong>contrast</strong> lives

- How much <strong>mid</strong> and how much <strong>light</strong>

- How much to <strong>blow out</strong> vs add <strong>detail</strong>

- Where to <strong>strengthen the silhouette</strong></p>

<p>That kind of exploration and selection is what separates <strong>good composition</strong> from <strong>okay composition</strong>. You can get drawing and proportions right and still miss out if you don’t push the composition. Experiment, compare, and pick the strongest.</p>

<p>Critiques are coming up next. Then we’ll move on to <strong>lighting</strong> and using values to show <strong>3D form and volume</strong>.</p>
