<h2>What's in Premium?</h2>

<p>In this lesson, you'll learn to transform <strong>blobs into boxes</strong> by focusing on the three primary sets of lines: <strong>left to right</strong>, <strong>up and down</strong>, and <strong>front to back</strong>. This approach simplifies complex forms into manageable shapes.</p>

<p>We'll explore <strong>foreshortening</strong> and how to use <strong>overlaps</strong> to convey depth in your drawings. Understanding the concepts of <strong>squash</strong> and <strong>stretch</strong> in forms will enhance the sense of movement and space.</p>

<p>Don't worry about proportions or vanishing points just yet. The goal is to <strong>simplify forms</strong> and build a strong foundation. Drawing subjects you enjoy keeps you motivated and makes the learning process enjoyable.</p>

<p>Challenge yourself with <strong>extreme foreshortening</strong> to push your understanding of perspective. Learn from others by observing how fellow students approach assignments and share their work.</p>
