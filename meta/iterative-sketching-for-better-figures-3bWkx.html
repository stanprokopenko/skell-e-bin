<h2>Paper and Tools</h2>

<p>I like working on <strong>marker paper</strong> because it’s <strong>smooth</strong> and allows for <strong>clean line quality</strong> without a distracting surface texture. The one I’m using is <strong>acid-free</strong> and <strong>100% cotton</strong>, so it won’t yellow or degrade over time. This makes it a good option for developing finished drawings that might be framed or displayed.</p>

<p>I’m working with <strong>Conte sticks</strong> here. They’re a <strong>chalky</strong> medium that’s a bit waxier than charcoal. I can adjust my pressure or angle to create crisp lines, softer edges, or fill broader areas.</p>

<h2>Building Iterative Studies</h2>

<p>I take inspiration from <strong>Michelangelo’s preparatory sketches</strong>, where he didn’t always finish an entire figure on one sheet. Instead, I’ll <strong>draw parts of the body</strong>, sometimes in multiple versions. This helps me explore different gestures or refine the form. This way, I focus on individual sections, like the head, a bent arm, or a foot, without worrying about fitting the entire figure on one page.</p>

<p>It’s also helpful to <strong>size and position</strong> these studies in whatever arrangement feels most natural. Drawing partial figures allows me to <strong>push dynamic curves</strong> and really emphasize the <strong>flow</strong> from one part of the body to another.</p>

<h2>Finding Corners and Curves</h2>

<p>When I begin a sketch:

- I <strong>simplify</strong> shapes as boxes, cylinders, or spheres.<br />

- I <strong>look for corners</strong> to emphasize structure and <strong>long-axis curves</strong> to capture fluid movement.<br />

- If something is stiff, I’ll try to <strong>push</strong> the curve in a second pass.</p>

<p>I often <strong>iterate</strong> to refine. Even if the first attempt is good, trying again might reveal a better contour or a more dynamic angle. Sometimes the second or third attempt doesn’t look as nice, but <strong>repetition</strong> still helps me understand the form and confirm my creative choices.</p>

<h2>Applying Line and Tone</h2>

<p>I like to start with <strong>light lines</strong> and then add <strong>tone</strong> for shadow areas. I keep in mind:

- <strong>Light vs. shadow:</strong> If a surface turns away from the light, it gets darker, and if it faces the light, it stays lighter.

- <strong>Core shadows:</strong> I often create a <strong>darker core</strong>, then <strong>blend</strong> outward to build soft transitions and emphasize rounded forms.<br />

- <strong>Box logic in rendering:</strong> I imagine top, side, and front planes. By shading each plane distinctly, I suggest the solidity of the form.</p>

<p>I also pay attention to <strong>negative space</strong>, the gaps around the figure. Looking at these shapes helps with proportion, and it can inspire creative designs if I notice an interesting silhouette emerging between different sketches on the page.</p>

<h2>Emphasizing Gesture Through Strokes</h2>

<p>My <strong>strokes</strong> typically follow the <strong>long axis</strong> of the shape. On an arm, for example, I’ll blend and shade up or down its length. It helps me keep a sense of <strong>flow</strong> and <strong>volume</strong>. If I need crisp edges, I’ll position the Conte stick to create a sharper line or use a stump or finger to <strong>soften</strong> transitions.</p>

<p>As I go:

- I develop <strong>core shadows</strong> to anchor the form.<br />

- I use my <strong>finger</strong> or a blending tool to smooth transitions.<br />

- I introduce <strong>highlights</strong> by erasing or layering chalk.<br />

- I create <strong>subtle corners</strong> by tightening lines where planes intersect.</p>

<h2>Drawing Reference Sheets</h2>

<p>When I finish, I end up with a <strong>reference sheet</strong> of studies, heads, torsos, and limbs. This is my <strong>research</strong>, and I can use it later for a bigger painting, a more polished drawing, or a full composition. Repeating this practice lets me <strong>dial in specific areas</strong> like a foot or a bent knee, until I have something that looks both <strong>well-structured</strong> and <strong>lively</strong>.</p>

<p>Drawing iterative studies lets me <strong>practice form</strong> over and over, discovering new ways to <strong>refine shapes</strong> and <strong>push</strong> the gesture. This method is practical, too. I can lay out multiple poses or body parts, then develop final artwork with more confidence. It’s a <strong>fun and rewarding</strong> process that deepens my understanding of the figure and prepares me for larger pieces.</p>
