<p><strong>Blending Techniques</strong></p>

<p>Using your fingers can be an effective way to create <strong>soft edges</strong> in your artwork, especially in larger areas like a head. When blending, aim for <strong>clean edges</strong> with minimal swipes to avoid muddy colors. It's important to wipe your fingers on a rag frequently to maintain cleanliness while blending. Remember to blend before the paint dries completely, which may require working late into the night. </p>

<p>Experiment with different techniques, and if finger blending doesn't work, switch back to using a brush. Using your finger can mimic drawing with charcoal or pastel, adding life to the artwork.</p>

<p><strong>Maintaining Accuracy</strong></p>

<p>If finger blending doesn't achieve the desired effect, reapply paint with a brush to reestablish the drawing. Initial layers of paint, like half tones, set the foundation for further blending and detailing. Some areas, like beards, may blend into the background, requiring careful attention to edges. Reestablishing the drawing after blending is crucial for maintaining accuracy.</p>

<p><strong>Refining Details</strong></p>

<p>After softening edges, focus on defining planes and forms with your finger. The artwork may appear monochromatic initially, but adding color variations will enhance realism. Use a filbert brush for detailed work, especially around the eyes, to improve accuracy. Squinting helps assess where the drawing may have deviated and needs correction. Adjusting values and edges is part of refining the artwork for realism.</p>

<p><strong>Self-Assessment and Improvement</strong></p>

<p>Comparing your painting to a reference photo can help identify and correct mistakes. Using technology, like taking photos of your work, can provide a new perspective for assessment. Developing the skill to spot and fix mistakes independently is valuable for artistic growth. Teaching yourself to identify inaccuracies improves observation skills and self-reliance. The goal is to learn to critique and correct your work without relying on others.</p>

<p><strong>Efficient Painting Practices</strong></p>

<p>Pre-mixed colors on your palette save time and effort during the painting process. This allows you to focus more on the creative aspects of your work rather than the technicalities of mixing colors.</p>
