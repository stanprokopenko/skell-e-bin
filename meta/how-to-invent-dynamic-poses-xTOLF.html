<p>In this session, I'm going to push our invention-based practices by starting with a reference, and seeing if I can come up with three or four versions that are distinctly different from the original. It doesn't have to be that I draw the exact pose, I'm not trying to just give you different angles of the same thing. Part of the invention is <strong>imagining the story</strong>, what's happening, and how something might be different.</p>

<h2>Pushing the Original Pose</h2>

<p>I like the idea of the hammer swing, but maybe a more exaggerated approach would be interesting. What if that hammer is <strong>really heavy</strong>, and the character is <strong>burdened by raising it</strong>, causing his back to lean further to support the weight?</p>

<p>I'm not changing my formulaic use of line, I'm keeping that consistent. I'm just pushing and imagining different directions for it. Here's the lumbar curve, and maybe he's kind of lost his footing. I'll place the pelvis here.</p>

<p>I always like the idea of <strong>weight not being balanced</strong> in poses when I push or invent my own. Maybe this leg comes forward, and we haven't talked too much yet about foreshortening, but I'll make that original line of the leg a little bit shorter and push the wrapping. Maybe his knee has buckled under him, and he's up on the ball of his foot.</p>

<p>Because of the raise of the arm and the lift of the shoulder across, maybe he started to swing and then lost it, and that weight started to pull his whole body back. I'll indicate the scapula on this side, and the shoulder. I'm going to drop this arm, maybe it's down and grabbing the hammer that's fallen. Perhaps the hand up top lost its grip, so I'll show this hand open, and the hammer is careening towards the ground.</p>

<h2>Creating Imbalance in Poses</h2>

<p>Part of this is putting the figure <strong>off-balance</strong>. In terms of my thought process for the invention of this pose, I'm really trying to take what I see and do the opposite, just as an exercise. In the reference, he's balanced based on that center of gravity, everything is equally divided and organized across. Here, I wanted it to be lost. <strong>Imbalance</strong> could be the single phrase for this, loss of balance, failure, surprise.</p>

<p>As that started to pull, maybe this leg has come out. The reason I did this was that one of the best ways for me to show that <strong>dynamic imbalance</strong> is always building off of <strong>diagonals</strong>. I positioned the leg out because I'm thinking about those larger movements.</p>

<h2>Exploring Different Moments in Action</h2>

<p>If that's the backswing and he's kind of lost it, how would I invent him swinging forward? Maybe, in terms of a forward swing, what if he took a step forward and buried that hammer? Now I'm going to organize the body to be <strong>moving forward</strong>.</p>

<p>You can see my preference when playing with invention is taking the pose, at least to start, and then trying to show if this is a midpoint in an action, the <strong>beginning and the end</strong>. Which is also a really cool tip from <strong>How to Draw Comics the Marvel Way</strong> regarding posing and inventing figures. You don't want to always show the middle, maybe you show the beginning or the end.</p>

<p>Maybe this is the hip, and in terms of putting the striking with the hammer, maybe the shoulder is back and comes a little bit forward, and maybe it's down here. Maybe this arm has also let go, and on the other side, the shoulder moves forward, the arm crosses the body, and the hand is down here gripping the hammer that's struck down.</p>

<p>I'm going to put this leg here so that it feels like it gives that big diagonal movement up. Maybe this leg could be in front, but I'm not going to put weight on it. I want the weight to feel like it came up and in through the arm and then down. I want to put more of an emphasis where the weight was dropped, so let's position him as if he's kind of stepped into it.</p>

<h2>Storytelling Through Poses</h2>

<p>Maybe the next one we do is more narrative. Perhaps this is a cosplay guy pretending to be Thor in his backyard, and he accidentally sledgehammered his neighbor's cat or something. Now, maybe he feels sad and is apologizing to his neighbor who desperately loved her cat.</p>

<p>Maybe his head is low, feeling a little meek. I've turned his body away because he's just kind of embarrassed and ashamed. His shoulders are slumped, and his head is low for the same reason. His arms are down at his sides, and the hammer is just kind of kicking it behind him, trying not to draw attention to it. Maybe his hand is moving forward because he's saying, "I'll buy you a new cat or something. Everything's gonna be okay."</p>

<p>After that, who knows? Maybe he goes and finds a new cat, and perhaps we do one where he's seated, and he's made up with his neighbor now. They're both enjoying the new cat.</p>

<p>Maybe he feels good now because he got a new cat for the neighbor, so he's relaxed. His body is more open, his posture is a little bit looser, he's nonchalant, and he has his elbow up on a chair. Maybe he's toasting to his neighbor and the new cat, got a drink or something like that, and everything's all right again. Everybody's having a good time. Maybe this leg's just down because that feels easy, nice and relaxed.</p>

<h2>Using This Technique to Explore Quickly</h2>

<p>This is what happens when <strong>invention goes wrong</strong>, or just when you have fun and play around. Let this technique be a medium for you to just <strong>quickly explore figures</strong>. That's the point. Hopefully, your thought process isn't as disturbed as mine, but if it is, this technique can allow you to get those figures down really quickly, and <strong>have some fun with it</strong>.</p>
