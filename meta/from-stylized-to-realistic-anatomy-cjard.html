<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>I want to talk about the <strong>shoulder girdle</strong>, which focuses on the <strong>clavicle</strong>, <strong>deltoid</strong>, and <strong>pectoralis</strong> muscles. I also look at how these forms fit together and how to visualize them in <strong>three-dimensional space</strong>. Bridgman’s drawings give us a foundation for construction, but I like to add clarity by refining shapes and thinking of these forms sculpturally.</p>

<h2>The Clavicle as a “Handlebar”</h2>

<p>I think of the <strong>clavicle</strong> as if it were the handlebars of a bike. This gives me a clear design when I draw its arcs and helps me remember its rhythm. On a real skeleton, the clavicles may look more bowed or sag in certain positions, but in a drawing, I like to push that “handlebar” shape so it reads well.</p>

<p>It helps to locate a few <strong>bony landmarks</strong>:

- <strong>Manubrium</strong> (the pit of the neck, where the clavicles join the sternum).<br />

- <strong>Acromion process</strong> at the tip of the shoulder.<br />

- The subcutaneous portions of the clavicle itself.</p>

<p>These points are often visible or just under the skin, so they help me place the <strong>shoulder girdle</strong> accurately.</p>

<h2>Deltoid and Pectoralis Interactions</h2>

<p>The <strong>deltoid</strong> wraps over the top of the shoulder, meeting the <strong>pectoralis</strong> at the clavicle. The pec fans outward toward the sternum, but part of its upper bundle also attaches along the clavicle. In Bridgman’s drawings, he often makes these shapes very angular or exaggerated to drive the point home.</p>

<p>Within the deltoid, especially the middle head, there can be some subtle striations or overlapping muscle fibers. When drawing these, I try to arrange them in a clear, well-designed way so they don’t look like random smudges.</p>

<h2>Thinking Like a Sculptor</h2>

<p>I tend to visualize the figure as if I’m <strong>carving</strong> it. This is what I call a “beveling” approach, imagine the forms made up of angled planes. In painting, this knowledge of planes becomes important for turning form with color and temperature changes. Even with a pencil drawing, I find it helpful to keep those planes in mind for shading or <em>indicating</em> the break between light and shadow.</p>

<h2>Shading in Bridgman’s Style</h2>

<p>Bridgman’s shading can be abrupt. He often uses <strong>linear “scratchy” marks</strong> placed close together to indicate dark values, and spreads them out for lighter halftones. To interpret this in a more tonal way, I look for where he places the densest lines and imagine that as the <strong>core shadow</strong>. Then I build up transitions around it.</p>

<p>Sometimes Bridgman breaks up a shadow shape on purpose, so we can still see crucial forms like the clavicle. That can make his shadows look disjointed, but it’s usually done to emphasize an insertion or a bony landmark.</p>

<h2>The Neck and Trapezius</h2>

<p>In many of these drawings, the <strong>trapezius</strong> sweeps down from the neck and creates a subtle indentation at its edge. The large <strong>sternocleidomastoid muscle</strong> (running from behind the ear down to the clavicle and sternum) may be shown as a simple band. I sometimes clarify this muscle more than Bridgman does, adding a <strong>clavicular attachment</strong> if it improves the structure.</p>

<h2>Why Bridgman Drawings Can Seem Rough</h2>

<p>From what I’ve learned, Bridgman often drew these for large classes, standing a few feet from big paper and using a piece of charcoal taped to a stick. He wasn’t focused on polished rendering, he was focused on construction, overlaps, and the key insertion points of muscles. Many of these drawings were later compiled into books, which can make them confusing in places. I build on his foundations by refining shapes, shading core shadows, and subtly transitioning between forms.</p>

<h2>Vignetting and Finishing</h2>

<p>Since these are <strong>partial studies</strong>, I like to <strong>vignette</strong> them. That means I end the drawing in a clean, interesting way rather than a hard cutoff. If I continue rendering, I contain the halftones or shadow shapes in simple, clear forms so they look deliberate.</p>

<p>Bridgman’s method is direct and sometimes feels abrupt, but he’s <strong>teaching us how muscles fit together</strong> and where major <strong>landmarks</strong> lie. Once I understand that structure, I can dial the exaggeration back for a more natural look. My goal is to blend Bridgman’s strong structural lines with a bit of careful shading, so I get a solid roadmap for the shoulder girdle without losing a sculptural feeling.</p>
