<p>Hi, I'm Aliza. I'm excited to share my sketchbook with you. This one is about two years old, maybe less. It's a Canson sketchbook with really nice paper, it has a little tooth to it. For the most part, I try to fill up a sketchbook a year. I don't theme my sketchbooks unless there's a purpose for that. I like to just go ahead and draw, without really any plan.</p>

<h2>Always Carrying My Sketchbook</h2>

<p>I'm one of those people who always tries to bring a sketchbook wherever I go. I might forget sometimes, but I try to have it with me as often as I can.</p>

<h2>Drawing Without a Plan</h2>

<p>As I flip through the pages, there's a lot of studies, but a lot of times I just want to <strong>push pencil</strong>. Sometimes I abandon drawings that aren't working, I don't draw over them. If something's not working, I just move on.</p>

<h2>Using References</h2>

<p>Most of my sketches are from reference. I have a lot of references laying around. A lot of times I don't stick to them exactly, but that doesn't mean they're not inspirational. Some are more like mood boards. Some of these end up being <strong>ideas for illustrations</strong> later on that I would do either for clients. I might reference old work, thinking, "Oh, this kind of fits the theme," and then elaborate on it or use it as reference for something new.</p>

<h1>Drawing from Videos</h1>

<p>Lately, I've been using a lot of <strong>video references</strong>, especially for gesture drawing. It really helps to get a sense of motion, and you get a bunch of poses by default. You get to almost experience something in 3D even though it's not in front of you. It's closer to life drawing than photo reference.</p>

<h2>Overlapping Poses</h2>

<p>Sometimes I overlap a lot of stuff. I do a lot of this because it's an ensemble of poses. It's difficult to find life drawing substitutes on your own time, so using video is an attempt to create life drawing without having live drawing in front of you.</p>

<h1>Developing Daily Drawing Habits</h1>

<p>I try to get into the habit of drawing at the same time every day so that it becomes second nature. If that's not possible, I make it work, but usually, I'll draw in the morning or before getting to projects. I try to warm up with either freehanding it or trying new material.</p>

<h2>Testing Materials</h2>

<p>For example, I might test new pencils by trying to come up with a way to have something in focus that blends. The forehead might be very blended and softened, while the nose and mouth are super high contrast. This is an exercise in that.</p>

<h2>Understanding Surfaces</h2>

<p>I often test materials on sketchbooks because a lot of times, it really depends on the surface. Some surfaces are very forgiving, some are not. This paper was a little difficult to pull out some of the values, but the blends were beautiful, so trade-offs.</p>

<h1>Exploring Shapes and Minimalism</h1>

<p>I often do exercises where I'm trying to be very quick and efficient with some head angles. There's a lot of <strong>shape exploration</strong>, using minimal layout, and seeing how much information I can pack with very few lines. That's an ongoing thing I'm doing.</p>

<h2>Not Striving for Pretty Drawings</h2>

<p>When I sketch in my sketchbook, I don't strive for pretty drawings. I mean, it's great to have pretty drawings, but it's more about <strong>testing out ideas</strong>. A lot of times, it's like workshopping through ideas that I have. If it's not successful, that's fine.</p>

<h2>Preserving Each Drawing</h2>

<p>As you can see, I don't draw on the backs of pages. The reason is that, as much as I want to test stuff, I also want to treat each piece like its own. If I were to cut this, I could put it somewhere. I think it preserves the drawings better in the long term because if I was drawing on the back, this would be imprinted on the other side, and it can get very messy very quickly.</p>

<h2>Balancing Realism and Design</h2>

<p>I do a lot of shape exploration, getting super designed within that kind of realistic lighting and anatomy. I have references that I'm looking at closely, and then I try to simplify shapes, group shapes together, and create some visual interest without straying too far from the realistic look I'm going for. It's a <strong>dance between realism and design</strong>.</p>

<h1>Pushing Minimalism</h1>

<p>With minimalist designs, I'm trying to see how far I can take it before it starts looking mushy and unclear, which isn't hard to get to. Sometimes I like where a drawing is going, but maybe something isn't working, so I'll try another one where I adjust what's not working.</p>

<h2>Avoiding Overworking</h2>

<p>I'm trying not to overwork a drawing to the point where I don't like it anymore. If I were to push it further, I would make a new one where it would be more complicated, but I wouldn't touch this one more.</p>

<h1>Using Multiple Sketchbooks</h1>

<p>I have too many sketchbooks. I have like three in rotation at the moment. These are different surfaces. This one is more illustration paper, so it has a little bit of tooth, which is great for soft smudges, but it's not really great for alcohol-based markers, it does leak, which I don't like. Moleskine is my other go-to because it is a lot thicker. I wish these were a little bigger. This sketchbook is nice and spacious.</p>

<h2>Drawing Anywhere</h2>

<p>As long as I'm drawing, that's the main thing. Even a little bit, even one little sketch is enough for me to feel like I've done my daily dose of art.</p>

<h1>Conveying Action and Interaction</h1>

<p>I did a series of hands here. I was referencing a pottery maker, so it's a video again. I really liked the way the material was handled, and I was trying to see if I could convey <strong>action and interaction</strong> without actually showing the clay part.</p>

<h2>Showing Tension</h2>

<p>It's a lot about the tensions in the fingers, even the tensions in the wrists, really showing that it's not a resting hand. It's actually a <strong>working hand</strong>. You can see how I'm still trying to push that idea. This was one video, and you can tell you can do so much with just one video. You just pause, draw.</p>

<h1>Focusing on Creating, Not Materials</h1>

<p>If you have limited time per day, I recommend not getting stuck on your setup in terms of materials. A lot of times I hear friends say, "I wanted to do watercolor, but there's no time," and it's the setup. If you cannot do something because it's stopping you from creating, I would change the set of tools for the time being.</p>

<h2>Using Dry Media</h2>

<p>That's why I've stuck to dry media for the longest time. I'm only now, after however many years of churning out work in sketchbooks, doing more painting, something that involves a lot of prep. If you take that out and you're still producing work, to me that's more important than fixating on, "Oh, I'm not painting." As long as you're creating, that's more important.</p>

<h2>Trimming the Toolset</h2>

<p>Whatever's the quickest way to get you to create will save you so much time. You only need an hour. If you can sleep one hour less a day, that's a fair trade-off. I've trimmed my toolset so much where it's just the most essential basic set of tools that I can take anywhere, so I don't have an excuse to say, "Oh, I cannot draw today because I forgot my pencils." Everything's literally right there.</p>

<h2>Drawing Daily</h2>

<p>Drawing daily too, I feel like if you say every other day, then it could be every other two days, and it's easy to go a week. But if you're like, <strong>every day</strong>, there's that urgency that makes you commit to having a lot of practice.</p>

<h1>Composing Overlapping Images</h1>

<p>People often ask me how I compose overlapping images. It's more about filling in the blanks. I'll start with one, and then based on that, if there's another one to complement it, I'll add it. The only thing I pay attention to is making sure nothing that I like is getting overlapped too much where it's lost.</p>

<h2>Balancing Simplicity and Detail</h2>

<p>For example, I try to keep a balance of simple and heavy. I might have a simple drawing here and a more detailed one there. I try not to overthink beforehand because I feel like it stops me from creating. Usually, I'll just commit to one thing, and it'll springboard something else.</p>

<h1>Deciding What to Render or Imply</h1>

<p>When deciding which elements of a form are going to be implied versus rendered, it depends on the reference. Some things just <strong>pop out</strong> to you, so I would keep those, and whatever needs to be almost in the background, I would either draw it implied or not even draw it, just skip it.</p>

<h2>Starting with What Catches the Eye</h2>

<p>I prefer to start with whatever catches my eye, whatever interests me. It could be pose based. Usually, it's the face, but it can be an arm or even the silhouette. Whatever stands out, I'll start there, and then build the drawing around that.</p>

<h1>Finding References Everywhere</h1>

<p>If you're stuck and don't know what to draw or where to start, I would go on YouTube and find a video of a performance. It can be anything, people walking on the street. Freeze-frame either as you go or you can even almost like Russian roulette it, just pause and draw. Sometimes it's a hit, sometimes it's a miss, but you'll be surprised how much information you get from very random stuff.</p>

<h2>Using Unconventional References</h2>

<p>I've used billboards as references, those "if you have an injury" ads with just a person. I'm like, "Oh, actually, I don't have an injury, but I like the person," and I'll draw that. I've used ads. <strong>Anything could be a reference, really.</strong> **</p>

<h1>Solving Drawing Problems on Paper</h1>

<p>When I have an idea for a larger piece or I'm commissioned to do something, I'll do exploratory sketches in whatever sketchbook I have at the time. Any drawing problem needs to be <strong>solved on the paper</strong>. That's why these exercises are very important for working through that.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p>Drawing daily and keeping a sketchbook is essential for me. It's not about creating pretty drawings but about testing ideas and pushing myself. By keeping my materials simple and always being open to new references, I stay creative and continue to grow as an artist.</p>
