<h2>Understanding Research Drawing</h2>

<p>Research drawing is all about <strong>getting more familiar with your subject</strong>. By <strong>drawing your topic repeatedly</strong>, you build comfort and confidence in portraying it from any angle. The goal is to <strong>draw it a bunch until you feel comfortable</strong>.</p>

<h2>Starting with Simple Objects</h2>

<p>Begin with something simple, like a lantern that's essentially <strong>just a box</strong>. This simplicity makes it easy and potentially fun. <strong>Drawing it at multiple angles</strong> helps you understand its form. In some images, you might already see it from various perspectives, which can guide you.</p>

<p>Think of this process as a metaphor for your research phase: <strong>getting familiar with your subject</strong> until you can draw it from any angle without hesitation.</p>

<h2>Breaking Down Complex Objects</h2>

<p>Move on to more complex items, like a lantern with a <strong>round spherical shape</strong> and <strong>interesting patterns</strong>. Instead of just copying what you see, <strong>think about the shapes that comprise it</strong>. Ask yourself how you might draw it from a different angle, like from the side, even if you can't see that view in your reference.</p>

<p>Consider the parts you can't see clearly, like the top of the lantern. Use your understanding to make educated guesses, maybe it's connected by some sort of wire. This way, you're <strong>imagining and inventing based on your observations</strong>.</p>

<h2>Creating Visual Interest with Repetition</h2>

<p>Drawing multiple instances of your object in a scene can be visually pleasing. <strong>Place them in various angles and positions</strong>, imagining them next to each other. This practice not only helps you get familiar with the object but also <strong>starts to define a location</strong> that could be a good setting for an illustration.</p>

<p>By <strong>drawing the same object multiple times within a scene</strong>, you can create a background for an illustration. It becomes about something and adds personality to your piece. Plus, it's more fun than worrying about references or wishing you had researched more things.</p>

<h2>Drawing from Observation and Imagination</h2>

<p>As you practice, you'll start to <strong>rotate objects to new angles without looking at a reference</strong>. This skill comes from understanding the underlying shapes that define the object. It gives you the flexibility to <strong>manipulate it around within a scene</strong>.</p>

<p>For instance, after drawing lanterns repeatedly, you might feel comfortable enough to draw them from above or at eye level, placing them throughout a space. This ability to <strong>draw from imagination while grounded in observation</strong> is a key outcome of your research phase.</p>

<h2>Developing an Illustration Idea</h2>

<p>Sometimes, your research can inspire new illustration ideas. For example, you might have photos you've taken, like images of buildings in Singapore with <strong>a bunch of AC units everywhere</strong>. This subject can have a unique personality and tone, almost <strong>solar punk in its vibe</strong>, and it can feel very cozy.</p>

<p>An AC unit is essentially <strong>just a box with a circle on it</strong> and some additional details. By becoming familiar with drawing it, you can start to manipulate it, <strong>drawing it from different angles</strong> and incorporating it into your scenes.</p>

<h2>Analyzing and Drawing New Subjects</h2>

<p>Start by <strong>drawing from observation</strong>, copying what you see to familiarize yourself. Notice the basic shapes and details:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Front plane</strong>: flat with either a circle vent or a square vent.</li>

<li><strong>Side details</strong>: interesting shapes that may stick out.</li>

<li><strong>Cables</strong>: wires sticking out, which you can draw from memory as winding cylinders.</li>

</ul>

<p>As you draw more, focus on the <strong>underlying shapes</strong> so you can manipulate the object later. This understanding allows you to <strong>draw it from other angles</strong> and integrate it creatively into your work.</p>

<h2>Playing with Ideas and Creativity</h2>

<p>Research can <strong>trigger fun ideas</strong>. For instance, you might decide to create a <strong>giant mech made out of AC units</strong>. Using the shapes and details you've learned, you can design a character with an AC unit for a head, adding elements like:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Cyclops head</strong>: using the circle vent as an eye.</li>

<li><strong>Side plane details</strong>: as facial features or accessories.</li>

<li><strong>Cables</strong>: as arms, fingers, or other appendages.</li>

</ul>

<p>Even if the drawing doesn't go well, <strong>you're playing and experimenting</strong>, which is a valuable part of the creative process.</p>

<h2>Expanding Your Visual Library</h2>

<p>By adding new pieces to your <strong>visual library</strong>, you gain tools to use in future drawings. Understanding the shapes allows you to:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Manipulate them</strong> in your work.</li>

<li><strong>Draw from different angles</strong> confidently.</li>

<li><strong>Create settings and scenes</strong> with the elements you've mastered.</li>

</ul>

<p>For example, incorporating parts from a vehicle you photographed, like the <strong>wheel and bent metal above it</strong>, can enhance your mech design. Even if you don't have all the angles you want, <strong>you can make assumptions</strong> based on your understanding of the shapes.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p>Research drawing is more than just copying references. It's about <strong>understanding your subject deeply</strong> so you can manipulate it, play with it, and <strong>draw what you really want to draw</strong>. By practicing this way, you add to your visual library and open up new possibilities for creativity and expression.</p>
