<p>I like to keep things simple and not intimidating, especially when it comes to my palette. Often, I find myself with too many colors, so for this session, I'm using a <strong>limited palette</strong>. I humorously call it "ketchup and mustard," instead of the Zorn palette. The colors I use include Winsor Newton's yellow ocher pale (mustard), alizarin crimson (ketchup), ivory black, and titanium white. Winsor Newton is my preferred brand because of its consistency and potency, though it's not the most expensive option out there. I recommend buying smaller tubes of paint unless you paint frequently like I do. Using a limited palette can still yield lifelike flesh tones and various grays, saving money on materials.</p>

<h2>Brushes</h2>

<p>I purchase my brushes from Dick Blick, an online art supply store, despite their high prices. My preferred brushes are Dick Blick's Masterstroke Finest Red Sable, long-handled, long flat, ranging from number seven to number one. I mostly use numbers two, three, and four, and I have some old brushes, including a rare mongoose hair brush. Good brushes are expensive, but cheaper alternatives like white synthetic sables from Michaels or Hobby Lobby can work. I advise against using bristle brushes for this painting style, as softer brushes are more suitable. A number three filbert brush can also be useful for certain strokes.</p>

<h2>Painting Medium</h2>

<p>For my painting medium, I use a mixture of walnut oil and Gamsol. This combination dries faster and is less toxic. My typical mixture ratio is one-quarter walnut oil to three-quarters Gamsol, but the ratio can vary. I cover the medium to prevent inhaling fumes and to slow down drying, allowing it to last 2-4 days.</p>

<h2>Tools and Maintenance</h2>

<p>I do a lot of mixing with a palette knife, which I've had for 25 years, and I use it solely for mixing, not applying paint. For cleaning my glass palette, I use a paint scraper from Home Depot with a razor blade. My glass palette, painted with a neutral gray underneath, has been in use for 30-35 years, showing a buildup of paint from my painting career. Visitors to my studio often find the accumulated paint on my palette interesting, as it reflects my 45 years of painting experience.</p>
