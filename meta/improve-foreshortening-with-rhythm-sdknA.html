<h2>The Challenge of Foreshortening</h2>

<p>Foreshortening can be daunting. Often, students shy away from it and miss one of the most beautiful opportunities in drawing. This is the point where you don't have to measure meticulously, you measure with rhythm, which means you don't measure at all.</p>

<p>We have a foreshortened pose here, over-foreshortened by the camera's cyclopic lens. We'll find this shape using the <strong>mermaid's net</strong>.</p>

<h2>Using the Mermaid's Net</h2>

<p>The mermaid's net, sometimes called the <strong>envelope</strong>, sets the parameters where all the legs, arms, and hands fit into. I like to keep the realms of fantasy in mind, thinking of ideas and thoughts as I work.</p>

<p>I'm feeling an elbow over here, and another elbow over there, so I can fit everything within this big beanbag shape. I find the ribcage, no longer an egg in this view, and mark the center. We're seeing more on this side than that side, so I feel this shape.</p>

<p>If you draw a small head in foreshortening, it always looks wrong. So, get a big head in there. Look at that shape. Because it's foreshortened by the camera's lens, we want to really feel a bigger shape here. Feel those hips go right out, get that knee up high.</p>

<h2>Exaggerating for Effect</h2>

<p>This is a weird lens, it gives a great comic book effect. Nothing's wrong, everything can be used for a reason. You can see how small that foot is compared to the head, no way your human eye would ever see that. But a comic book artist can. Whatever medium you're working with, everything is valid.</p>

<p>I find the hip curl all the way around. This is where the idea of comic books really helps. Feel the bottom of the ribcage where the 9th and 10th ribs are. It looks almost so shallow as not to even appear at all.</p>

<p>Feel the breasts as one shape and consider the <strong>accordion effect</strong>, the pinch on one side and the stretch on the other. It's wider here, with the hips, ribcage, and breasts forming one shape. Look at how different that whole shape is.</p>

<h2>Placing Limbs in Foreshortening</h2>

<p>We can see the tilt going in this direction, finding weight coming this way. If you want to place the arm and hand, go to where the hand's going to be. Remember, the hand is <strong>half to the knuckles, half to the longest finger</strong>. It's a big hand because we're very close to it.</p>

<p>Throw the elbow out and come in for the shoulder. Feel that shoulder coming at us and the arm pulling right out there. We have this, and going straight over to the other shoulder, we don't see it. We pull the arm out from there and can pull that arm through.</p>

<h2>Adapting the Mermaid's Net</h2>

<p>It's going outside the mermaid's net. Whatever feels right, that feels right to me. The mermaid's net is just a parameter, you can go in and out of it. Don't try to stay within it if it does not feel right.</p>

<p>There's that point where the <strong>sartorius</strong> from the other side gives us that curve we saw in the other drawing, pushed onto the <strong>malleolus</strong> of that leg. You can see that I've completely changed that around. A big, beautiful calf right there.</p>

<h2>Understanding Anatomy in Foreshortening</h2>

<p>There's the <strong>biceps femoris tendon</strong>, pushing in, coming out for that <strong>greater trochanter</strong>, giving us this box shape here, coming in and high hip from underneath. We're seeing the high hip now from a different view altogether.</p>

<p>We haven't talked about this before, this is the <strong>tensor fasciae latae</strong>. No, it's not a coffee drink! Think of it as a pocket, put your hand in the pocket, it's exactly that place. So really feeling the push of this hip coming up high.</p>

<p>Look how the <strong>adductor magnus</strong> muscles compress with gravity. <strong>Gravity reshapes muscles</strong>, so the pressure of the compression there.</p>

<h2>Dealing with Foreshortened Features</h2>

<p>This breast is coming up. We've got a bit of a tangent here, so I'm going to push these hips back a little so we have room for that breast to move. That all feels better.</p>

<p>Here's proof positive that the nipples are below the center line because here they're almost on it from this view. I think the more rounded you make the breasts, the weirder they look. So try to vary those shapes.</p>

<p>With the foreshortened face, just keep it simple. There's the eyebrows, come in for the eye and the nose, and that's all you really need to do. A little muzzle for the mouth, push out for the chin, how the ear comes in.</p>

<h2>Building Confidence Through Practice</h2>

<p>After you've done a couple of drawings, even the most difficult ones go in quite easy. You want to do your better drawings in the last part of the day so it feels fresh. You're so fresh at the end of the day because you've been through it. You've used your <strong>internal art engine</strong>.</p>

<p>Your internal art engine is the engine you've built from all of your mileage, all the drawings you've done. And so you end up with an external art engine on show. It looks like magic. You're just building from that engine, which by the end of the day has been filled with the fuel of all these drawings that you've done. It's really amazing how that affects the rest of your drawings.</p>

<h2>Embracing Mistakes and Learning</h2>

<p>That alone is enough to say we've learned a lot about foreshortening. The idea of the head being much bigger is definitely something you should keep in consideration.</p>

<p>There's the <strong>epicondyle</strong>, make sure your bones are hard. And there's the <strong>brachioradialis</strong>, pushing out to give us that bow shape. And the more you draw those muscles, the more they show.</p>

<p>This is called an <strong>olecranon</strong>, it is the little cap on the elbow. Don't make it too round like I just did there, even though it is a cap. So you can just square that off a little bit.</p>

<h2>Drawing the Head and Hair</h2>

<p>You can see here again, there is the medial epicondyle. So you've got the lateral here, lateral means outside, medial means toward the middle, and there's our olecranon once again.</p>

<p>You can comic book that and make it so obvious that it's a bone, but I tend to knock that back because it's the <strong>nuts and bolts</strong>. Remember, the nuts and bolts we hide.</p>

<p>There's the eye going in. The hairline follows this, so you're thinking of this like a canister that's just doing this and everything fits around it, eyes, nose, mouth. The only thing that comes off a little bit is the eyebrow that comes up higher, but it's so little from this point, you'd hardly notice it.</p>

<p>Let's say she is a mermaid and her hair is spilling out like this along the beach, running through her fingers. You know, that's a beautiful image. And that's a really great start for an oil painting or a drawing. You've worked out all your foreshortening, all the beauty of it, and it's really dramatic.</p>

<h2>Adjusting and Simplifying</h2>

<p>Let's see that foot be that <strong>calcaneus</strong>. Don't be afraid to do a big calcaneus. Remember, it comes quite fast back, the malleolus, which is the ankle bone.</p>

<p>I'm not going to put that foot in. It looks too weird. This is enough. You can change things around as much as you like. You're in complete control, so allow yourself to be the boss.</p>

<p>Here, one last thing is the handlebar shape right there of the <strong>clavicles</strong> where your neck fits in. A little lower from that.</p>

<h2>The Beauty of Pentimento</h2>

<p>A little bit of <strong>pentimento</strong>. The idea of pentimento is that it's animation. It shows the artist's mind at work, shows what they thought and what they changed. So there's a nice little moment there.</p>

<p>We've seen how it all works, and then the navel fits in right here. And we have the abs, remember they have their own block-off system. So they come down like this, and from this angle they are heading in toward the pubic bone like that.</p>

<p>From this angle, the <strong>iliac crest</strong> looks like this, rather than going up the opposite way, the high-waisted swimsuit. We're seeing that shape because it is a very thick bone.</p>

<h2>Understanding Bone Structures</h2>

<p>From the side, let's say we have the gluteus doing this, the crest of the hip doing that, the leg doing this, <strong>biceps femoris</strong> doing that, the calf like this, and that's the foot.</p>

<p>Let's say we have all of that on show, and there's the knees. What's happening here is the hip crest does that around to the back, but it's actually a bone that's shaped like this. So we're seeing the top of it from around the other side. That's all that's happening there. It's as simple as that.</p>

<p>The <strong>tensor fasciae latae</strong> that looks like a pocket is that shape there. But it also bends. If you pull your leg out like this, it actually comes around with it and bends. If you ever see that shape, that's what that is. So it's a big player, rarely talked about.</p>

<p>I'm going to reshape this for the trochanter, and then we have a lovely little moment to foreshorten from. <strong>Foreshortens are my favorite way to draw</strong> because you get so much rhythm in it. It's really wonderful.</p>

<h2>Adding Shadows and Details</h2>

<p>I could come in here now and start to feel the flesh, especially on the breasts here. Add some shadows on the inside and in here.</p>

<p>I don't have all the time in the world to do this. I'm just going to put in enough and maybe finish a little bit of the drawing. I like how that shadow is falling across here.</p>

<p><strong>Drop shadows are terrific</strong> because they show you the shape of the form that dropped it and the shape of the form that it's fallen on. So it's falling across those lower abs and across that thigh.</p>

<p>Again, this is a wonderful shadow, this drop shadow coming up for the hips. And it gives me a chance to put these adductor magnus in. Look how they compress there. I'm overdoing it because I love them.</p>

<h2>Pushing the Limits</h2>

<p>I have a saying when I teach animation: <strong>push it till it breaks</strong>. And so the minute it breaks, then pull back, but at least you got the maximum out of it. Because you can always come back from it, so there's no loss.</p>

<p>Sure enough, because we've been working with gestural structure, things are a little wobbly. If you look at the works of Egon Schiele, nobody would ever say that was broken, they'd just say that's just beautiful. It's an artist's vision, how they saw it, how they felt it.</p>

<p>I know that sounds a little bit arty, but it is true. <strong>The best artists indulge themselves</strong>. So this is how I do it, take it or leave it. And that's how you find your audience. You please yourself, and your audience will find you. Never chase an audience, this is my advice. When you do it for yourself, they will find you.</p>

<h2>Refining the Drawing</h2>

<p>I'm finding this breast here. The utmost curve is on the outside, and then the most flattened side is on the inside. But here, because of compression and weight coming this way, it's a slightly different shape. So I'm just finding it.</p>

<p>This is the broad end of the pencil here, just finding that circular move. Use your fingers at that point. You don't want this to have a hard edge. Remember, bring back everything we've learned today. <strong>You want to learn to love the pencil, love the pencil</strong>.</p>

<p>Underneath, we can see the scapula coming up, that's why you have that hard edge. And then we have here the little muscle with the big name, the <strong>coracobrachialis</strong>, which separates the long head of the tricep from the bicep at the front. Basically, where the hair under the arm would be is where you see that little divide.</p>

<h2>Drawing the Face Upside Down</h2>

<p>Drawing the nose and the eyebrow thicker on the inside and just wrapping upwards a little bit, and just the curve of the eyeball from above. Eyelash there, not too much, don't make it cartoony. And just a little almond shape on the way out, on each side.</p>

<p>Just the corner of the nostrils here. You can just soften that for tone. One of the most complicated things is drawing from upside down. <strong>Don't be tempted to turn the page around</strong> so you can draw the head from another direction because you'll lose the idea of learning to see. Don't be tricking yourself is the bottom line there.</p>

<p>Don't try to fool your audience either. Remember, this is a conversation you are having. And if you wanted to do some armor, I always work it around the breasts as they are. Don't try to design it from the start, design it near the end to wrap around these shapes because the shapes are more familiar to you now, and then you'll be more fluid.</p>

<h2>Final Touches and Personal Expression</h2>

<p>You're always more fluid at the end of an artwork, that's the time to put your imaginary stuff on. There's all that complication of the kneeling point, and the patella from a different view. You want to be careful not to make it too knobbly, because then you draw attention to it.</p>

<p><strong>Great trochanter again</strong>, that flatness that we get coming up to the sit bones. This is where it becomes almost a trap for young players. If you don't put this <strong>carpal tension</strong>, then the hand just looks like a wooden extension of another wooden pole.</p>

<p>The finger breaks into two parts, draw the top part first and then the underneath. Notice I'm putting these little lines to go up, telling the audience that that's before the knuckle, the knuckle comes afterwards. That's the time to be the most gestural.</p>

<p>So on your index finger, the finger that points, that is the one I make the most gestural. Then you can come underneath to find the fingers after the effect. So there's practically drawing the impossible there, a hand and a face from upside down. <strong>Be fearless</strong>. It's only a drawing.</p>

<h2>Killing the Ego</h2>

<p>So <strong>kill the ego</strong> and do those things that seem to be impossible. The worst you can do is just waste a piece of newsprint. And you know my idea that <strong>there are no mistakes, it's just learning experiences</strong>.</p>

<p>Just feeling that bicep curve down to the shoulder. So much more out of it. So I'm going to pull that hair across the arm, for instance. Feel it spill and tumble. She could be a witch. She could be a mermaid. Let that hair pull out like tendrils.</p>

<p>Let the malleolus pop a little, the <strong>tarsal mass</strong> pushed on. So when you get a foreshortened foot like that, you've really got to make a little bit more of it. It just looks like a stump.</p>

<h2>Embracing Artistic Freedom</h2>

<p>I'm not too keen on coarse shadows. They look a little 3D, a little bit too much light on them. Almost like being shot in a studio, and that is the case here. So I want to take it a little bit more outdoorsy. You get less of that.</p>

<p>I don't want to get close into the photography. I'd rather be a little blind to it. That'll help me with the massing. See a little bit of the tendon here of the <strong>pectoralis</strong>, which is nice.</p>

<p>You can play with this art pencil, I call it an art pencil, it's just a general soft. You really manipulate it until you really feel like you're going to commit, really feel the curve of that <strong>frontalis</strong>, even underneath the hair.</p>

<h2>Allowing for Pentimento</h2>

<p>The <strong>pentimento</strong> makes everything beautiful. One, two, three goes at it. Let hair go through the fingers there. You can put some bracelets on there if you want. You put a bracelet on here, it's coming back, using that idea of the contour again.</p>

<p>A little bit of mess in here in the shadows, some mystery. <strong>You don't have to draw everything that you started with</strong>.</p>

<p>Once again, you know what that is. I'll write it there and let you say it.</p>

<h2>Using Anatomy for Style</h2>

<p>So seventh and eighth ribs we see here, we don't see the ninth and tenth. You can see the curve just here, where the ribs divide. So I'll just put them in because they make a big impact about here, like that.</p>

<p>You can see here that <strong>I draw like I paint</strong>. I put down strokes, move them around, blend them. So charcoal, for me, it's dry oils.</p>

<p>So there we go. We have a nice wibbly wobbly, timey wimey, the idea of <strong>gestural structure</strong>, meaning that everything is not going to be too solid, but there lies the beauty of that.</p>

<p>If you want to solidify it, then go to the curves. When they're too curved, put a straight on them. And the best place to put a straight is on the most curved part. I know that sounds counterintuitive, but it really does make a big difference.</p>

<p>If you look at the works of Jack Kirby, for instance, that's where you'll see why that is so powerful an idea. It's the opposite of what you'd expect, and then it shows the mark of a master.</p>

<h2>Ending Thoughts</h2>

<p>I just want to get that eyebrow in, it's so beautiful, and the eyelash. Now, I always say kill the ego. On this occasion, just allow yourself a little bit of ego in there. So art is not like anything else, it can be a contradiction.</p>

<p>But we did most of this without ego, so we can put a little bit of flesh in there. Basically, people want it to look like it was easy, and that's a little bit different from the nuts and bolts ego.</p>

<p>Usually, you see the first rib up here is quite straight, and that's where you see the rib on the upper rib cage. If you see lots of little puckers down here, I'm not too keen on them, but you might like them. It can show a little bit of rhythm that might be missing if you need it.</p>

<p>So that's the idea of style, you use the anatomy. That's why I wrote the book <strong>The Anatomy of Style</strong>. Use your knowledge of anatomy to be stylistic. You can choose what to leave off, what to put in, where to put a hard edge, and where there's a soft edge. Change it around. As long as everything reads true, then everyone is going to applaud your decisions.</p>

<p>Don't be afraid to go outside the lines either. Have you ever developed that idea? Keeping the lines? If you weren't really an artist, that's a weird idea.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p>Okay, so the clock is ticking for me, so I'm going to just call it. But I could render this now for another two hours and end up with a really lovely foreshortened figure.</p>

<p>Remember, this isn't just about nuts and bolts. <strong>This is about expressing yourself as an artist</strong>.</p>

<p>So I'll leave it at that. You guys can imagine what it'd be like to finish that. Or better still, draw this and finish it yourself.</p>
