<p>I've been exploring how light interacts with different materials. <strong>Light absorbs, reflects, and refracts</strong>, and these properties determine how we perceive objects. Let's dive into examples that illustrate these concepts.</p>

<h2>Specular vs. Diffuse Reflection</h2>

<p><strong>Specular reflections</strong> are mirror-like reflections of light sources, while <strong>diffuse reflections</strong> scatter light in many directions. To tell the difference, move your head around an object, if the lighting on its surface changes, those areas are specular highlights, if it doesn't, it's a diffuse reflection.</p>

<h2>Examples with Different Materials</h2>

<h3>Matte, Glossy, and Metallic Surfaces</h3>

<p>I experimented with teapots of different finishes. The <strong>matte white teapot</strong> had <strong>no specular highlights</strong>, only diffuse reflections, resulting in soft, uniform illumination. The <strong>glossy ceramic teapot</strong> displayed <strong>specular reflections</strong> atop diffuse reflection, and I could see reflections of myself, the room, and windows on its surface.</p>

<p>A <strong>metallic aluminum teapot</strong> reflected the room entirely, lacking local color, pure specular reflection. Scratches and tarnish slightly diffused the reflections, and in sunlight, dust and fingerprints became more visible. A <strong>copper and brass teapot</strong> showed <strong>colorized reflections</strong>, orange from copper and yellow from brass, adding to its unique material properties.</p>

<h3>Translucent Materials and Subsurface Scattering</h3>

<p>Materials like <strong>candles, grapes, acrylic skulls, and gummy bears</strong> exhibit <strong>subsurface scattering</strong> and <strong>refraction</strong>. Light penetrates these materials, scatters internally, and exits at different points, creating a glow or bending effect. For instance, candles show a warm glow shifting from yellow to red as light passes through the wax.</p>

<p>I photographed a skull made from acrylic. Lit from behind, it revealed subsurface scattering and gave a glow similar to real bone. Objects like a <strong>clear acrylic ball</strong> or <strong>glass bottles</strong> demonstrate <strong>refraction</strong>, bending light as it passes through them. A tinted glass bottle isn't just one flat color, it reveals deep reds, browns, blacks, and yellows, adding complexity to its appearance.</p>

<h3>Textured and Tarnished Surfaces</h3>

<p>Textures like <strong>corrosion</strong>, <strong>fingerprints</strong>, and <strong>dust</strong> alter how light interacts with surfaces. An older, tarnished coffee pot had unclear reflections due to scratches and corrosion. Even the <strong>dust and smudges</strong> on a metallic teapot affect its appearance by diffusing reflections and highlights.</p>

<h3>Anisotropic Reflections</h3>

<p>Materials like <strong>satin fabric</strong> show <strong>anisotropic reflections</strong>, where highlights stretch along the direction of fibers. This creates unique highlights different from typical specular reflections, adding to the material's distinct appearance.</p>

<h2>Observing Material Properties</h2>

<p>Understanding an object's <strong>material properties</strong> is crucial. I encourage you to hold objects, observe them in different lighting, and note whether they exhibit diffuse reflection, specular reflection, subsurface scattering, or refraction. Notice how textures and surface conditions impact reflections and highlights.</p>

<h2>Magical Effects with Light</h2>

<p>For a creative experiment, I added <strong>luster dust</strong> to colored liquid in a glass bottle, creating a <strong>sparkling, pearlescent potion</strong>. This demonstrated how light interacts with particles suspended in a medium, producing mesmerizing effects. Observing these interactions can inspire illustrations of fantastical substances.</p>
