<p>Creating the Iron Fist #4 cover was a dream come true. I had long envisioned illustrating the lineage of Iron Fist, showcasing that it's more than just Danny Rand but a heritage of heroes throughout history.</p>

<h2>Developing the Concept</h2>

<p>With the introduction of a new Iron Fist and Danny as his mentor, I saw the perfect opportunity to bring my idea to life. I designed a composition threading the various Iron Fists together, highlighting how each is shaped by those who came before.</p>

<p>I incorporated the Iron Fist logo, the dragon symbol, weaving through the figures. The <strong>Iron Fist chi</strong> connects from hand to hand, symbolizing the ties that bind them across generations.</p>

<h2>Pitching to Marvel</h2>

<p>As a comic fan, I follow industry news closely. Upon hearing about the new Iron Fist series, I reached out to my editors at Marvel, eager to contribute. They welcomed my idea and asked for sketches.</p>

<p>I shared several concepts, with this one being my favorite. Marvel loved it and gave me the green light. I was thrilled to begin.</p>

<h2>Creating the Illustration</h2>

<p>I used one of my students as the model for the new Iron Fist, he was great. I modeled some figures myself and used reference images for others, focusing on the costume details.</p>

<p>Exploring the different costume designs was fun. Each Iron Fist has unique elements, yet common threads unite them. From the militant style to traditional kung fu, I enjoyed the varied <strong>aesthetics</strong>.</p>

<h2>Artistic Choices</h2>

<p>I aimed for strong contrasts between warms and cools, the cooler greens against the warm yellows and oranges of the Iron Fist power. Even though green and orange aren't complementary colors, they create a harmony I love.</p>

<p>I wanted to evoke the feel of a Hong Kong Bruce Lee movie poster, incorporating <strong>montage elements</strong>. This allowed me to explore a more design-focused approach, moving beyond literal scenes.</p>

<h2>Reflecting on Legacy</h2>

<p>Creating this piece was the culmination of years of passion. I've spent decades mastering my craft, bringing such ideas to life. The legacy of Iron Fist, an ideal passed down, resonates deeply with me.</p>

<p>As an artist, I connect with that concept. I strive to honor illustrators before me and inspire future generations, contributing to a tradition that endures.</p>

<p>By presenting Iron Fist not just as a character, but as an ideal, I aimed to convey that each generation builds upon the last. This piece is my way of sharing that vision and excitement with others.</p>
