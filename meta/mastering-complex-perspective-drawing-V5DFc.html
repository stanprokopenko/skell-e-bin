<p>You're about to see a more complex projection demo. It's real-time and it can be challenging to follow. So, I want to propose two options. One is to go for it, some people thrive on this kind of challenge and it may be where your brain feels at home. Alternatively, you can watch to become aware that we have a scientific approach available, and that you share the planet with people who will do this. That may be enough for your studies, but I recommend giving it a try a few times before you decide.</p>

<h2>Setting Up the Point of View</h2>

<p>Okay, we're going to attempt the cottage from a point of view. I'm going to place the point of view, the center of vision will be right there. We'll put one of the vanishing points perhaps in the picture plane, and the other one's gonna be pretty far away.</p>

<p>We'd better be sure of these vanishing points right now. So, before I go any further, here is what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna find my vanishing points on the picture plane by running a line parallel to that line from the viewer. I'm going to label one of the vanishing points as <strong>RVP</strong> (Right Vanishing Point) right there. The other vanishing point will be off in that direction. Let's carry it through and find it, it's gonna be all the way over there, which will be out of our sight for most of this.</p>

<h2>Projecting Points onto the Picture Plane</h2>

<p>Now we've got to project down a whole bunch of points. We have to make sure my ruler lines up with the viewer's point and whatever point we're projecting.</p>

<p>Let's start with that far corner and run that line down, making a little tick mark for that corner. I'm going from the corners to begin, and making thick tick marks. There's another one, we'll make it a thick tick mark. Here's the corner of where the roof overhangs. I could do where the ground plan hits the ground, which will be these, but I think I'll stick with what we've got.</p>

<p>Make a thick tick mark for that one. Right there is an important one, because that's where the two parts of the building come together. We'll make that a pretty thick one. We can do the same thing over here, that's where the two buildings touch, so we'll make that a nice thick one.</p>

<p>The far corner looks like it's pretty much the same mark, just a little to the left of it. Run a line there, that's another thick tick mark. That corner could be useful. We're looking for important corners now, things like this.</p>

<p>I'm going to use an even thinner pencil, 0.3 mm, and we're gonna have those two that will land right there. Then, where that box intersects with the body of the building, we'll run a line from there and make a tick mark. That also gives us that front corner of that little box and where it touches the building here.</p>

<p>Some of these we could figure out by deduction. If we get one peak of this roof, one peak is all we need. But we can always do this peak over here, that way, we'll have two dots to tell us where the peak begins and ends. The reason I say one peak will do is that there's a process of connecting the dots, and this process will help us find that peak.</p>

<p>Let's finish up with this box that's connected to the front, this one right here and this one right here. For every one of these lines, I'm making sure I'm going from the viewer's point to whatever corner I seek, and then make the tick mark.</p>

<h2>Drawing the Ground Plan in Perspective</h2>

<p>It looks to me like I have pretty much all the tick marks I need. This is the roof overhang, and that's where body meets body. Over here, same thing, there's the roof overhang, and there's where body meets body, which will give us a point there.</p>

<p>Now, we're going to take every last one of these points and drop them down. Let me remind you what we did:</p>

<ul>

<li>We placed the viewer here, which means that a <strong>60-degree cone of vision</strong> should include all of that.</li>

<li>We found where the vanishing points would be, the right vanishing point (RVP) and the left vanishing point (LVP).</li>

<li>We're looking down on a picture plane like this.</li>

<li>We found where any one of these corners will intersect with that line from this viewer.</li>

<li>Then we project it down.</li>

</ul>

<p>We don't care about that viewer anymore, we have used the viewer for the viewer's purpose, which was to place where we were. I might just make a little dot, gonna poke a hole through there and make a little dot underneath that. That's where the viewer was.</p>

<h3>Projecting Down to the Ground Plane</h3>

<p>Our job is to project these down. Let's start with this front corner. If that front corner comes down onto this line system and our vanishing points are here and way out there, we don't want to put the corner down too low because it's going to make the vanishing points almost at right angles. Let's say that our front corner will be right about here, that is the front corner of this whole plan.</p>

<p>We can be sure that if these lines are going back to vanishing points, the front lines are going to go back in the same way. We're safe that way, we're sure of this thing.</p>

<h3>Determining Where Lines Stop</h3>

<p>Where does that line stop? If we go from here to there and then run a perfectly vertical line, it will show us that's where that footprint, which is a little wider than a footprint, stops. Where is the back corner going to be? It's going to be on a vertical line, somewhere around there. Where is this back corner going to be? Well, it's going to be on a vertical line somewhere around here.</p>

<p>Every one of them, I had to find where they touched here, I can't just go straight down from there.</p>

<p>Once we've found this line, we're covered. That footprint line, which hits right there, should give us, as we run from the vanishing point through that line, it should land right where this line, which is the back corner, comes down. And it does, that is the shadow that would be cast straight down from this.</p>

<h3>Drawing Vertical Lines</h3>

<p>At some point, we're gonna need to put in that overhang bit. In fact, why not do it right now? Let's see, when this comes down here, that's this part that shows us where the building is gonna touch the ground. It comes down to there. The other one is pretty much just straight down to there. We're only getting the line system.</p>

<p>I'm gonna eyeball this, as long as I hit that line and keep it fairly consistent, I think I'm covered well enough for that. That is this area, and we're looking down. If it were to cast a shadow straight down, it would look like this.</p>

<h2>Adding Elevation</h2>

<p>Now it's time to concern ourselves with elevation. Exactly how high do these lines go in perspective? And when they go further back, how do we know exactly where they go? Well, we're gonna need an elevation.</p>

<p>This ground plan shows depth and width, it does not show height. The elevation shows height and width, but it does not show depth. We need to know the heights.</p>

<h3>Finding Heights Using the Picture Plane</h3>

<p>We can say that wherever this point, which gives us the true height of where the base of that roof is, it's gotta fall on this line. It's actually this point here, or the same height. So, where do we stop on that?</p>

<p>If this is touching the picture plane, we know that it's not closer to us and therefore bigger, or further away from us and therefore smaller. So that means that if we line up the very base of this house, we line this up so the base lands there, then we know that the height will be a dot on that line.</p>

<p>I'm only making it a dot, I think that's important. The height of this, which will be back in the space, but we can't know how high until we've decided the height of it. Let's tape this down, or better yet, let's put this underneath here just like that.</p>

<p>Then we can say that is the base, the lowest part of the roof, that is the highest part of the roof. Now, what do we do? We know those lines are correct.</p>

<ul>

<li>Run back to that vanishing point and back to that vanishing point.</li>

<li>We'll stop right there, that's where this corner will be and this corner here.</li>

<li>Where does that corner land? It's gonna land right there, that's gonna be the back corner.</li>

<li>If we wanted to find the other ones, we don't need to. I'll go ahead and lightly scribe them in to see whether I'm accurate. It should meet right there if it's correct, and it does.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Establishing the Peak of the Roof</h3>

<p>Now we need to get the peak. The peak is gonna be this high, but it's gonna be back. How do I know where to place the peak? It's gotta be where that height line intersects with this depth line.</p>

<p>We've got what we need, it's a simple matter of <strong>connecting the dots</strong>.</p>

<p>If we run this one back, a width line back, where do we stop? We could go like this, then run that vertical line from where the peak intersects and see where it intersects with that width line. That takes care of the inclined plane. We've done it.</p>

<h2>Connecting the Dots</h2>

<p>Talking these in because we know that those are the final word. Now the back corner, and it's a little bit narrower, so it ends up being about there. Of course, a good deal of that's going to be hidden.</p>

<p>I'm going to eyeball this. I'm going to say that this looks convincing enough to me, foreshortening taken into account. When we run back to the vanishing point, the left vanishing point, it should intersect right there and give us the under plane as such.</p>

<h3>Drawing Additional Structures</h3>

<p>Now we've got this area to do. Let's take the point where this body, not the roof overhang, touches and run that line directly down and see where it touches. That gives us the point in perspective, where that would hit.</p>

<p>How about this one over here, which runs down to there? Let's run it down, that gives us the point where it would hit. Good. Then if this is the farthest most point, better do this one here because that's where the base on the ground is.</p>

<p>Let's see what happens when we run lines back to the vanishing points from some crucial points, like that one. It will hit right there, darken in this line now because that's the point where it hits the ground. That must then head back to the right vanishing point, which puts it here on the ground.</p>

<h3>Adding the Little Addendum</h3>

<p>This, which is the furthest back point of the little addendum, can run from there to that point on the ground. I might not want to make that so dark. We could find this point here, which will run straight down, that is the point where the roof overhang would hit the ground. I'm gonna put it there.</p>

<p>Looks like I might not have been as extremely accurate as I ought, the roof overhang as it would shadow on the ground is coming to about there. When it hits this point, that's the point I need it to hit to be sure that I'm placing that roof overhang properly over.</p>

<p>There's a little point back there, and we're gonna touch that just ever so lightly. Let's get the back corner over there, it's going to land. Put in some vertical lines we know we'll need, like where building touches building and where the true exterior corner is. Lines that are best done dark enough to bring them forward.</p>

<h3>Completing the Ground Plan</h3>

<p>Well, we don't know how high to take those lines yet, but we've got one more line to go. This one will land on this point. Where on this vertical point will it land? Well, if this one, we know where that point is on the ground, it's right there. We know that the back corner is going to land on the same line system, and at the same height. It's gonna go like that.</p>

<p>How far back do I go? We run that until it, do the straight edge, not rely on hand skills for this. I always think I'm making a straighter line than I actually am. Here we go, right there, where this line intersects that corner. We know that corner's there because it hit there. Then we run this back, and things should land in places that make sense, and they do. That will land right there, where we thought it would.</p>

<p>I now have the ground plan in perspective in toto.</p>

<h2>Adding Details</h2>

<h3>Drawing the Planters</h3>

<p>We've got these two little planters here and here. We know that those two little planters, that this back line there where it will intersect with the body of the house will be right there. So we can say that's where it's going to intersect with the body of the house. The other line that intersects with the body of the house is gonna be right there, that's where it intersects with the body of the house.</p>

<p>This point, and then that one will be from there. Good enough. How high do we make them? Well, let's bring one of them out. We only need to get the height of one, and then we can get the other. If we bring this base out to where it touches the plane, the picture plane, we're taking it out beyond the overhang of the roof.</p>

<p>How far out? Let's find out. Let's take this point right there, and run it straight down. There we go, from there to there tells us that's how far out. Well, that gives us a lot.</p>

<p>Now that we know that, once we run the depth lines from the other one and then run a width line back to the left vanishing point from this point, it's going to give us what we need for how far out to the front both of these project and the true height.</p>

<h3>Determining the True Height</h3>

<p>The true height will be right along this line, because it touches the picture plane there. So that means that if we put this under here and find the true height of that little thingamajig, it'll be there, that is all we need to take care now of every remaining line.</p>

<p><strong>Life is good</strong>, and there's no question that it's got challenges and difficulties, and that suffering is a part of it. But when the lines all line up and you get what you want, what you counted on, oh, I'll tell you, life is good. Don't let 'em tell you otherwise.</p>

<h3>Connecting the Remaining Lines</h3>

<p>Just connecting dots, all this is. It's just an elaborate dot-connection extravaganza. As long as you've got that thing lined up where it's supposed to be, all your hidden lines will be taken care of.</p>

<p>Let's throw back some of the lines we don't need, darken up the ones we have chosen to love. Darkening up these lines a little thicker than they need to be, but that part that I've darkened in there is this whole plane here, very foreshortened.</p>

<h2>Completing the Drawing</h2>

<h3>Drawing the Small Shelter</h3>

<p>Now we need the height of this little thing, and we know this point touches the picture plane, and it touches the picture plane on this line. So it's gonna be along that line, and we've gotta take the height of this line up to the base of that roof, and then again up to the peak of that roof. But we must take the height measurements on a line that is touching the picture plane.</p>

<p>Fortunately, this one does touch the picture plane right there. This one doesn't, which means we're gonna have to find where it would be at that level. Now you understand that theory, let's now place it.</p>

<p>Let's do the same thing we did before. Let's see if we can align this underneath so that the base of that small part of the shelter goes right, trying to align it through vellum, which is easier than aligning it through construction paper. I want to make sure we're on the correct line, that line right there, that's the height of that.</p>

<p>Now we've got that point, which is this point, and this point's height and place, its left to right are lined up. What about this peak? The peak of the roof, if it were up against the picture plane, would be this high. Ah, it isn't up against the picture plane, it's back. But at least we now know how high it would be.</p>

<h3>Projecting Back the Roof</h3>

<p>If we want to project back the base of the roof, we do it this way, we run it up to that vanishing point. We can see right about there, that is gonna be the end of it. Where will the peak be? Let's take the peak on the front line, run it back to that vanishing point, and then see where it lines up from here to here. Then, right along there, we have now got dots to connect. That's a really tight triangle, but we've got it.</p>

<p>Again, I'm going to eyeball this, eyeball that parallel. No, I think I can do it, it's good enough. We can go in and find whether that lands. We just don't want to take the time to do every single line when some of them, the amount of difference it's gonna make is practically nil.</p>

<p>Oh yeah, that back plane is very foreshortened, in fact, we're only seeing a little sliver of this over there. I know that's how high that back plane would be, because it goes like that. But this line is foreshortened to the point where that part that I've darkened in there is very minimal.</p>

<h3>Final Touches</h3>

<p>Where do we go for this? Well, we know that it goes back to the left vanishing point. So let's take it from that point, where do we stop? Well, we can figure out where to stop. We can see that it's going to hit the house, right? Get a vertical in there, right there. It's gonna hit the body of the house right there.</p>

<p>What about the peak? It should be right there on the same vertical line as the peak of this one. How high will it be? We've got the height over here, which we projected from back there, and let's run it back until it hits that vertical line. Then we can connect those two dots, this one and that one, and we're gonna have our small roof. Well, that's a reason to rejoice.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p>We've connected all the dots and drawn our cottage using complex projection techniques. This has been an elaborate exercise in perspective, and while it's challenging, it's also rewarding. You might find it tedious at first, but with practice, it becomes intuitive.</p>

<p>Remember, it's all about finding the points, projecting them accurately, and connecting the dots. Perspective drawing is a powerful tool, and mastering it opens up a world of possibilities in your artwork.</p>
