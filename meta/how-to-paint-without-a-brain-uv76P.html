<p>Welcome to the course, <strong>Painting Without a Brain</strong>. I'm Morgan Weiss Lane, and I'm excited to guide you through this journey. This course is inspired by my experience teaching my young daughter to draw. I wanted to give her the same artistic journey I had in art school, but in a way she could understand. So, I taught her to draw without using her brain, focusing on objective observation.</p>

<h2>Concept of Painting Without a Brain</h2>

<p>The core idea of this course is to teach you how to observe <strong>objectively</strong>, without relying on any preconceived knowledge. This means looking at shapes, both negative and positive, and learning to plumb, line, and measure like a robot. My daughter quickly grasped this concept, learning to draw what she saw rather than what she thought she saw. This approach helps avoid symbolic thinking, where we draw based on what we think an object looks like, rather than its actual appearance.</p>

<h2>Challenges of Unlearning</h2>

<p>In art school, I faced the challenge of unlearning many preconceived notions. I had to deconstruct the knowledge I had built up from reading books about drawing. This process of unlearning is crucial for objective observation. As a beginner, you have the advantage of learning this method without the baggage of prior knowledge, making it easier to grasp.</p>

<h2>Simplifying the Learning Process</h2>

<p>This course is designed to keep things simple and avoid overcomplicating with advanced techniques. Watching an advanced artist paint can be like watching a magic show, impressive but not educational. My goal is to help you understand the process, not just to impress you. I'll take it slow and make it easy for you to follow along.</p>

<h2>Methodical Learning Approach</h2>

<p>We'll break down the learning process into <strong>stages</strong>. You'll master each stage before moving on to the next. This methodical approach ensures that you understand how each part fits together. By following this structured method, you'll find that becoming a good artist is more achievable than you might think. It's about linking each stage together, not juggling everything at once.</p>

<p>The key to this course is <strong>simplicity</strong> and not overthinking. We'll start with the basics and gradually build up your skills. In the next stage, we'll focus on materials. I hope you enjoy this learning journey and find it as rewarding as my daughter did. Let's dive in and start painting without a brain!</p>
