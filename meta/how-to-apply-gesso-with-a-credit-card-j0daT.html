<p><strong>Selecting Canvas Boards</strong></p>

<p>When choosing canvas boards, you can purchase them from various stores like Hobby Lobby, Michaels, Joann's Fabrics, or Dick Blick. It's important to ensure that the canvas boards are <strong>acrylic primed</strong> for better results. You can identify if a canvas is oil primed by its distinct smell, which differs from acrylic.</p>

<p><strong>Preparing the Canvas Surface</strong></p>

<p>Acrylic primed canvas boards are not only affordable but often come in packs, making them a convenient choice. Even if the canvas is already primed, <strong>gessoing the board</strong> enhances the painting surface. For a smoother texture, especially when painting portraits, use black professional white gesso.</p>

<p><strong>Applying Gesso</strong></p>

<p>Instead of using brushes, which may conform too much to the canvas texture, use credit cards or similar flexible tools to apply gesso. This method helps smooth out the surface. As gesso ages, it thickens, which can improve application consistency. For larger strokes, consider using wider scrapers available at stores like Home Depot. Start applying gesso from the outside edge to avoid lines and aim for an irregular pattern of strokes to prevent visible ridges. It's crucial to let the gesso dry overnight to prevent reactivation when applying washes.</p>

<p><strong>Toning the Canvas</strong></p>

<p>Once the gesso has dried, apply acrylic washes to tone the canvas gray. Using acrylic paint for toning is faster and avoids the drying time associated with oil paint. A medium gray acrylic paint helps in judging colors during mixing. Keep the process simple by using a consistent gray tone, though variations are possible. To help spread the paint evenly on the canvas, use a spray bottle.</p>
