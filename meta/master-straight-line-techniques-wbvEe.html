<h2>The Importance of Straight Line Practice</h2>

<p>Let's start with your straight line practice. Some of you have proven yourselves better at this than I am! I may have been a bad influence by working fairly small, and I think we do better to <strong>work larger</strong>. Larger is harder, and I'm convinced that if you can make a straight long line, it'll be easier for you to make a straight short line than the other way around.</p>

<p>Good work, everyone. In the comments on these, the word <strong>meditative</strong> came up, and also observations that <strong>pulling a line</strong> is different than <strong>pushing a line</strong>. I find pulling a line much easier to keep straight than pushing it.</p>

<h2>Thoughts on Mastery</h2>

<p>I offered some thoughts worth repeating here, including referring to George Leonard's book <strong>Mastery</strong>. There are three types of people who run into trouble on their journey to mastery:</p>

<ol>

<li><strong>The Dabbler</strong>: The person who doesn't care that much.</li>

<li><strong>The Hacker</strong>: The person who cares enough to get to a level and doesn't grow.</li>

<li><strong>The Obsessive</strong>: The one who cares so much that they undercut the process.</li>

</ol>

<p>I can give you the secret: the <strong>love of doing it</strong> gets you past those three things. But I do recommend the book, and make sure it's the George Leonard version of <strong>Mastery</strong>.</p>

<p>Even 17 videos into the course, it still feels like the beginning, training my impatience to grow more patient. And yes, it does feel like the beginning because it is. I'm not a "no person left behind" teacher because some people don't follow. But we're not going to speed this up or rush it. We're going slowly, partly for your benefit to dig in deep. I hope that you'll look back on this time as when you dug so deeply into perspective.</p>

<h2>Tips for Straight Line Practice</h2>

<p>Now, if you take the time to look at people's straight line studies, it's typically not the kind of thing that students get excited about, but it may. Because when you look at what others are doing and say, "I can do that," that's why we're posting these exercises.</p>

<p>I've got a list of things we can do with straight lines:</p>

<h3>Pulling Lines vs. Pushing Lines</h3>

<p>We can divide them into <strong>pulling lines</strong> and <strong>pushing lines</strong>. You've already mentioned that, and so have I. There's a method of training children to draw straight lines where the emphasis is to <strong>pull the line</strong> because the word "drawing" itself implies to draw something out, to extract it, or to pull a cart along behind you. But I recommend, if you're ambitious, to try it both ways.</p>

<h3>Ghosting the Line First</h3>

<p>Another tip is to <strong>ghost the line</strong> first. One of you mentioned that in the demo I did, I didn't ghost the line, I went direct. Going direct is more risky. <strong>Ghosting</strong> is a way to practice without touching, and then say, "I've got the move, now let's get it." I suggest doing it both ways and seeing which one you do better with.</p>

<h3>Non-Dominant Hand Practice</h3>

<p>There's the discovery that if you're right-handed, the 135-degree line is easier than the 45-degree line, and the opposite if you're left-handed. I recommend that you try this with your <strong>non-dominant hand</strong>. Because when you choose your non-dominant hand, you make it harder.</p>

<h3>Creating Challenges</h3>

<p>There's a way to make it harder by working with a graphite pencil on <strong>wax paper</strong> if you really want to put a handicap on yourself. Then you'll find that with gritty paper and a charcoal pencil, it tends to be a little easier because there's so much grip and so little slip that you can have more control over it.</p>

<h3>The "Grandpa Line"</h3>

<p>Vera mentioned the <strong>"grandpa line"</strong>, she explained that her grandpa would deliberately make little jaggedness to the line so that you would forget about trying to keep the line smooth and put the emphasis on making the line straight. That may or may not be a good idea, but you could try it. The opposite is to do the <strong>slick line</strong>, where my emphasis is to make it one beautiful line. A good deal of what you studied in the basics course had to do with making good-looking lines, not shaky lines.</p>

<h3>Fast and Slow Lines</h3>

<p>Consider drawing <strong>fast and slow lines</strong>. The fast line can help you keep it straight, but sometimes the slow line can too. That relates to another way to look at it, the <strong>journey or the destination</strong>. If you draw a line with the feeling that "I am going on a line in a direction and I am not changing direction," that might help your imagination. But another person, and I think most people do better, to concentrate on "that point is the one I'm aiming at, I'm here, I will go there without stopping to think."</p>

<h3>Becoming a Robot</h3>

<p>Scott Robertson talked about turning your arm into a <strong>robot</strong>. If you just imagine <strong>no fear</strong> in a robot, <strong>no emotion</strong> in a robot, sometimes a metaphor helps. Trying to give a haircut to a five-year-old boy who could not hold still was impossible. But we found that if we said, "Be a statue," he could hold still for 10 to 20 seconds because he had in mind a game of pretend. Sometimes, inventing your own game of pretend can help you do better with this.</p>

<h3>Scaling Up Your Practice</h3>

<p>If I were to say anything, challenge yourself by working from <strong>smaller to larger</strong>. I think John even has a slide where he went from small to large, and we hope that you went from small to large, rather than from large to small. One of the things we'll find out about this is that there are many ways to do it.</p>
