<h2>Starting with Ambient Light</h2>

<p>I began with a simple geometric composition of a mountain landscape divided into four layers, the sky, distant mountains, mid-ground castle, and foreground hill with a character walking along a path. My initial focus was on <strong>ambient light</strong>, considering a bluish, cloudy daylight that illuminates everything softly.</p>

<p>I started very rough, refining slightly without relying on line art, because in reality, there are no outlines. I split the composition into distinct layers, locking them for easier painting and allowing me to work on each element individually.</p>

<h2>Creating an Ambient Occlusion Pass</h2>

<p>Next, I added an <strong>ambient occlusion pass</strong> to each layer, painting soft shadows to represent a gray day. This step emphasizes the shape and form without considering the local color of objects. It's all about the <strong>soft lighting</strong> and how it interacts with the various elements in the scene.</p>

<h2>Adding Local Color</h2>

<p>With the soft lighting in place, I introduced <strong>local colors</strong> to represent grass, stone, and snow under the same generic bluish-gray light. This serves as a foundation to explore various lighting scenarios without fully refining the artwork. The goal is to keep the sketches loose while focusing on how light affects the scene.</p>

<h2>Exploring Different Lighting Scenarios</h2>

<h3>Misty Morning</h3>

<p>I transformed the scene into a <strong>misty morning</strong> by adjusting the sky to a grayer tone and adding soft clouds. Layers of fog were added between the elements to create depth and separation. Reducing saturation made the colors more muted, enhancing the misty atmosphere. Tiny lights in the castle drew attention as the focal point, providing color contrast against the subdued background.</p>

<h3>Thick Fog</h3>

<p>For a scene with <strong>dense fog</strong>, I lightened the distant mountains and blurred them slightly to simulate atmospheric diffusion. Adding heavy layers of fog created patchiness, giving the impression of fog rolling in. The character became the focal point due to the highest contrast against the foreground, emphasizing their presence in the scene.</p>

<h3>High-Key Morning Light</h3>

<p>I wanted a <strong>high-key, bright morning</strong> scene. Using a reference of a sunrise, I painted the sky with blues, oranges, and yellows. Soft light came from the left, with gentle shadows and pastel colors. A <strong>glow layer</strong> added to the soft, beautiful morning atmosphere, making the scene feel inviting and tranquil.</p>

<h3>Pool of Light Effect</h3>

<p>In this version, I introduced a <strong>pool of light</strong> effect. With some clouds in the sky, I directed sunlight only onto the castle, leaving the background mountains and foreground character in shadow. This strong <strong>focal point</strong> draws the eye to the castle. Fog layers enhanced separation and added to the overall mood.</p>

<h3>Midday Sun</h3>

<p>Using a reference with sunlight from the right, I adjusted shadows and added <strong>bounce light</strong> reflecting off the character's red cloak and the surrounding rocks. A cyan highlight from the left added specular contrast, emphasizing form. Adding glow to the sky suggested the sun shining down, softening the image and creating a different type of warmth.</p>

<h3>Sunset</h3>

<p>For a <strong>sunset scene</strong>, I shifted colors towards purples and added a sun low in the sky with glow effects. Specular highlights on rocks and the character enhanced the setting sun's impact. Window lights in the castle added contrast, creating a high-contrast sunset mood with a distinct feeling compared to the sunrise version.</p>

<h3>Nighttime Scene</h3>

<p>Lastly, I created a <strong>nighttime scene</strong>. Darkening the image, I painted in dark clouds and added fog layers for separation. <strong>Window lights with glow effects</strong> suggested activity in the castle. I introduced a moon with warm glow and rim lighting on clouds and structures. Adding stars and a magical glow from the character's staff made the character and castle entrance the focal points, enhancing the mystical atmosphere.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p>This process demonstrates how varying lighting and color transforms a simple line drawing into multiple compelling scenes. By thoughtfully applying ambient light, shadows, local color, and atmospheric effects, we can explore different moods and focal points, enhancing the storytelling in concept design. It's all about how <strong>light</strong> and <strong>color</strong> can dramatically change a scene's appearance and emotional impact.</p>
