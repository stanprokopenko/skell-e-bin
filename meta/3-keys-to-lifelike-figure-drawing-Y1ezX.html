<h2>Discovering the Body’s Beauty</h2>

<p>Hi, I’m Steve Houston. Being an artist means I get to spend time seeking out what is most beautiful in the world. And there’s nothing more beautiful, or more challenging, than the human body. My goal is to keep drawing skills simple and intuitive, so we can capture that beauty on paper.</p>

<h2>Mastering Three Key Skills</h2>

<p>I believe you can become an excellent figurative artist by focusing on three basic craft skills:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Structure</strong>: Build the constructed architecture of the figure with clear forms.  </li>

<li><strong>Gesture</strong>: Capture the fluid energy and movement of the body.  </li>

<li><strong>Light and Shadow</strong>: Use two basic values, light and shadow, to create a lifelike illusion of form.</li>

</ul>

<p>Whether I’m describing a pose with lines or rendering it with values, these three skills let me unite each part of the human figure into a solid, graceful composition.</p>

<h2>A Holistic Approach</h2>

<p>Beyond technique, I use a holistic approach that connects craft with creativity. Great art is born from both the head and the heart, so I train both my skill set and my mindset. I’ve worked with many artists over the years, and I’ve seen firsthand how tapping into personal creativity can make each drawing more meaningful and unique.</p>

<p>I also borrow techniques from world-class performers to avoid the frustrations that might hold me back. By managing doubts and staying focused, I can keep moving toward my creative goals with confidence.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p>Craft and creativity, head and heart, skill set and mindset, these ideas form the bedrock of my art journey. I strive to be better next month than I am today. And why not? The world becomes a better place when we spend our lives seeking out what’s beautiful. Wherever your artistic path leads, I hope you’re having the time of your life.</p>
