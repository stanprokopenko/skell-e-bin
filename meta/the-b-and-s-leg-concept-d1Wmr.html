<h2>Main Functions</h2>

<p>I see the legs as <strong>two major pillars</strong> that support my torso, neck, and head. They also <strong>propel movement</strong>, helping us run to the store or away from a cave bear. Because of these functions, the legs are designed to be <strong>straight and stable</strong> like architecture, so imagine <strong>Stonehenge</strong> and its pillars. But they also need flexibility and mobility, to move us around.</p>

<h2>Basic Shapes</h2>

<p>I like to simplify the legs into <strong>tubular forms</strong> with <strong>long-axis curves</strong>. I focus on:

- Keeping a balance between straightness (for support) and subtle curves (for visual rhythm).<br />

- Avoiding overly curvy, “spaghetti” legs that don’t look like they can hold weight.</p>

<h2>Front and Three-Quarter Views</h2>

<p>When I’m viewing the legs from the <strong>front</strong> or a <strong>three-quarter angle</strong>, I tend to see:

- <strong>Outside Contour</strong>: Often more active with one or two curves (thigh curve and calf curve).<br />

- <strong>Inside Contour</strong>: Quieter, sometimes straighter or with simpler curves and small bumps.  </p>

<p>This pattern fits a design similar to <strong>Greek vases</strong> that widen, then narrow, then widen again. The hips are wider, the knees narrower, then the calves widen, and they narrow again into the ankles.</p>

<h2>Profile Views</h2>

<p>From a <strong>side view</strong>, I usually notice:

- A shift so the <strong>“active” side</strong> might become the back of the leg.

- An <strong>S curve</strong> effect in the overall silhouette of the thigh and lower leg.<br />

- Sometimes it appears like a <strong>B shape</strong> if we shift more toward a front or back angle.</p>

<p>I keep an eye on wide hips moving to narrower knees, then out again, and down to narrower ankles. The rotation at the hip, knee, and ankle can also change the look of these curves.</p>

<h2>The “B” and “S” Concept</h2>

<p>A simple way to remember these leg curves is <strong>“B” for front or back views</strong> and <strong>“S” for side views</strong>. I learned this from Bern Hogarth, who was one of my early mentors. I try to recall “B.S.” whenever I break down the rhythm of the legs.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p>My approach is to keep it <strong>simple yet characteristic</strong>: tubes with thoughtful curves that suggest weight-bearing support and dynamic movement. I look for big shapes, watch for the inside/outside flow, and rely on the <strong>B</strong> and <strong>S</strong> ideas for guidance. That way, I can quickly block in the legs and adjust them to look strong, stable, and ready for action.</p>
