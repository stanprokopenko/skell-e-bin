<h2>What Are Value Keys?</h2>

<p>Value keys describe the overall value relationships in a piece. I like to think of them as the <strong>major areas of light and dark</strong> that define a painting’s structure. In general, there are three broad types:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>High Key Paintings</strong>: Majority of values are in lighter tones.  </li>

<li><strong>Mid Key Paintings</strong>: Majority of values are around the mid-gray range.  </li>

<li><strong>Low Key Paintings</strong>: Majority of values are in darker tones.</li>

</ul>

<p>You can add contrasting accents in each type, some lighter or darker spots, even if the rest of the painting leans in one direction. But it’s all about how <strong>the majority of your values</strong> group together.</p>

<h2>High Key Paintings</h2>

<p>High key paintings center on the <strong>lighter range</strong> of the value scale. This doesn’t mean you can’t include mid to dark accents, but <strong>most values</strong> should stay in the lighter half.<br />

When your painting is mostly very light, even a slight drop into the medium range will look very dark and can feel out of place. Shots of a darker value will pop dramatically if they’re not carefully controlled.</p>

<h3>Example: Emile Carlsen’s High Key</h3>

<p>In an Emile Carlsen painting with a high key approach, there are almost no dark accents. Turning it black and white makes it clear that most values sit well above mid-gray. Small hints of mid values appear in the foreground, but they’re delicate. If I added darker shapes, they’d stand out “like a sore thumb” and break the painting’s harmony.</p>

<p>Because the <strong>value separation</strong> is so subtle, lost edges become common: shapes flow together where values are nearly the same. A slight highlight on a tree trunk or a rock can make it stand out against a background of very similar values, yet the overall look remains soft and ethereal.</p>

<h2>Mid Key Paintings</h2>

<p>A mid key painting uses <strong>values closer to a middle gray</strong>. You’ll still find some lights and some darks, but they are minor accents. Many paintings naturally fall into mid key because it’s how we tend to see the world in normal daylight, dilated, but not overly bright or dark.</p>

<h3>Example: Emile Carlsen’s Mid Key</h3>

<p>Carlsen has a piece where the rocks are mid-value, and the foamy water creates the lightest accents. The water’s darker sections create contrast, but broadly, the painting stays around the middle of the value range. This gives it <strong>moderate drama</strong>, not too bright, not too dark.</p>

<h2>Low Key Paintings</h2>

<p>Low key paintings push the <strong>majority of values into darker territory</strong>. They often evoke a moody or dramatic atmosphere. Think of Caravaggio or Rembrandt, where intense contrasts (chiaroscuro) produce strong highlights against nearly black backgrounds.</p>

<h3>Example: A Dark, Moody Scene</h3>

<p>In some of Carlsen’s work, there’s a night-like mood with deep shadows. One bright accent in a house window stands out as the lightest note in an otherwise dark composition. That single highlight commands attention because it sharply contrasts with the painting’s overall <strong>low key</strong> setting.</p>

<h2>How I Adjust Value Structure</h2>

<p>I often decide on my value key before I start painting. That choice guides every subsequent color and contrast decision. Sometimes I convert a reference photo to black and white and then tweak the values to match the key I want (high, mid, or low). This frees me to <strong>invent colors</strong> without feeling locked into the photo’s color data.</p>

<p>By focusing on <strong>value first</strong>, I keep the painting’s structure consistent. Then I can choose a more creative color palette on top of that strong value framework. Even if I’m painting from a real-life scene, exploring a black-and-white reference can open new possibilities. With the foundational values set, color choices become more flexible and expressive.</p>

<p>When you take full command of your value keys, whether high, mid, or low, you’ll find endless creativity waiting just beneath the surface of your designs.</p>
