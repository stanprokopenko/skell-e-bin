<h2>My Nightly Sketchbook Ritual</h2>

<p>After a day of working for clients as a freelance concept artist and industrial designer, I love to unwind by sketching in my nightly sketchbook. Sitting on my couch, I draw whatever inspires me at the moment. This practice lets me explore ideas, experiment, and just have fun without any pressure.</p>

<h2>Drawing What I Love</h2>

<p>I often sketch characters and themes that I enjoy, like <strong>Zelda</strong>, <strong>robots</strong>, and <strong>animals</strong>. One of my favorite creations is the <strong>Berserker Otter</strong>, which is best described as an otter with ADD and a big sword. I also enjoy drawing <strong>ridiculous animals</strong> armed to the gills, because just because they're cute and cuddly doesn't mean they can't have recourse.</p>

<h2>Embracing Fun in Art</h2>

<p>At the end of the day, <strong>art is about fun and relationships</strong>. My sketchbook is a space to experiment with absurd ideas, like a duck driving a tank over a field of skulls or a tortoise that's also a grenade. I like taking things that are perhaps defenseless and giving them a twist.</p>

<h2>The Importance of Line Weight</h2>

<p>I've <strong>sold out to line</strong>, I'm addicted to line weight. Line weight is crucial in drawing, especially for robots and mechanical designs. I use a three-weight line system - </p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Contour lines</strong> for silhouettes (darkest lines)</li>

<li><strong>Parting lines</strong> where assemblies come together (second thickest)</li>

<li><strong>Detail lines</strong> for internal features (thinnest)</li>

</ul>

<p>Having this hierarchy helps create depth and clarity. I'm passionate about teaching this, as there's not a lot of instruction available on how to effectively use line weight.</p>

<h2>Daily Habits and Health</h2>

<p>I start my day with a walk, and some journaling to prepare my mind for creativity. <strong>Being healthy as an artist</strong> is important, our brains need rest and care. Every night, I make time to sketch, even if I'm tired. <strong>Maintaining a good sketch habit is crucial</strong>.</p>

<h2>Learning from Failure</h2>

<p>I believe in the importance of failure. <strong>If you're not failing at least once a week, you're not pushing yourself</strong>. Every week, I try drawing something where I might totally wipe out. It's through failure that we grow and improve.</p>

<h2>Combining Technology and Nature</h2>

<p>I love the idea of overusing technology and how it might relate to nature going forward. In my sketches, I often combine the two, like <strong>robots with television faces</strong>, <strong>trees that move</strong>, or <strong>animals using advanced tech</strong>. This juxtaposition allows me to ask questions and explore concepts that fascinate me.</p>

<h2>Interacting with the Art Community</h2>

<p>Art is relational. Sharing my work on platforms like Instagram allows me to connect with others. Sometimes, I incorporate suggestions or popular themes, like drawing <strong>mushrooms</strong> or creating <strong>fan art</strong>. It's fun to engage with the community and have that interaction inform my work.</p>

<h2>Advice for Fellow Artists</h2>

<ul>

<li><strong>Carry a sketchbook</strong>: Be ready to draw whenever inspiration strikes.</li>

<li><strong>Establish daily routines</strong>: Consistency is key to growth.</li>

<li><strong>Focus on big shapes first</strong>: Start with a strong, simple statement before adding details.</li>

<li><strong>Have fun</strong>: Draw what you love and let your passion shine.</li>

<li><strong>Embrace failure</strong>: Don't be afraid to try new things and make mistakes.</li>
