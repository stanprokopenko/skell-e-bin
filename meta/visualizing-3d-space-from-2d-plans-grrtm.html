<h2>The Final Project: A Series of Puzzles</h2>

<p>Your final project for this lesson is a <strong>series of puzzles</strong>. You'll start with a single plan that tells you <strong>how wide</strong> and <strong>how deep</strong> an object is, but it tells you <strong>nothing about height</strong>. This means you can <strong>make up heights any way you want</strong>.</p>

<h3>Manipulating Heights</h3>

<p>You can:</p>

<ul>

<li>Make <strong>positive parts into negative parts</strong> and vice versa.</li>

<li><strong>Squash and stretch</strong> the height of any portion of the block.</li>

<li>Create heights in an <strong>obvious</strong> or a <strong>less obvious</strong> way.</li>

</ul>

<p>This exercise is <strong>good for your brain</strong>, and it's not hard if you use a template.</p>

<h3>Using Templates</h3>

<p>I've made a few templates you can use, and I'll get to that in a moment. These templates fix the position as it spins left to right, but you're free to create flexible heights. If you prefer, you can even use <strong>isometric graph paper</strong> to make it simpler.</p>

<h3>Floating Elements and Wires</h3>

<p>You can make one portion <strong>float above or below</strong> another. Just be sure to <strong>connect them with little wires</strong> or <strong>height lines</strong> to clarify any confusion about where it really is.</p>

<h2>Tracking Heights with Height Lines</h2>

<p>You'll have to do this slowly. <strong>Every corner counts</strong>, and it takes some thinking about which lines are on the other side. When you know which lines are on the other side, you can <strong>fade them back</strong> to enhance the illusion.</p>

<h2>Drawing Orthographic and Oblique Views</h2>

<h3>Drawing Side and Front Elevations</h3>

<p><strong>One plan, various elevations</strong>. If you want to be sure you're getting this, <strong>draw the side and front elevations</strong>. You can do this <strong>before or after</strong> you draw the oblique views.</p>

<ul>

<li>If you draw the orthographics first, you have to conform your oblique view to them.</li>

<li>If you draw the oblique view first, you have to conform your orthographics to it.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Stretching Spatial Awareness</h3>

<p>Drawing the other views <strong>stretches your awareness</strong> to the other views. It helps you <strong>know the true proportions</strong>. If you want to exercise the part of your brain that solves <strong>spatial puzzles</strong>, pause and look over the images until they make perfect sense to you.</p>

<h2>Exploring Alternative Approaches</h2>

<p>We could do this puzzle another way:</p>

<ul>

<li>If this were a <strong>side view</strong>, we could <strong>play with the width</strong>.</li>

<li>If this were a <strong>front view</strong>, we could <strong>play with the depth</strong> since front orthographics don't show depth.</li>

</ul>

<p>Just remember that a draft view is one flat view that needs more to complete it.</p>

<h2>Embracing Pure Three-Dimensional Thinking</h2>

<p>This is pure <strong>three-dimensional thinking</strong>. If you find it difficult, <strong>try copying these examples</strong>. Eventually, you'll get it.</p>

<h3>Creating New Elevations and Forms</h3>

<p>If you already get it, <strong>try some new elevations</strong> based on this plan. If you want to master it, <strong>create your own forms</strong> from these plans. See how many variations you can do on these.</p>

<ul>

<li>Or go fully independent and <strong>make up your own plans</strong>, but keep them all <strong>right-angled</strong> for now.</li>

<li>Start simply. Some genius may do some complicated first attempt and keep track of everything and put bevels in there, but we normal folks do better, I think, to start simply.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Simplifying with Graph Paper</h2>

<p>You can even make it simpler by using <strong>isometric graph paper</strong>, which has angled lines that take away the problem of vanishing points.</p>

<h3>Using Isometric Graph Paper</h3>

<p><strong>Isometric graph paper</strong> features:</p>

<ul>

<li>Every line is exactly <strong>60 degrees</strong>, <strong>90 degrees</strong>, or <strong>120 degrees</strong>.</li>

<li>There's <strong>no convergence</strong>.</li>

<li>You have nice light blue traces of every line.</li>

<li>You always know how to put a plan into perspective because <strong>foreshortening is predictable</strong>.</li>

<li>You can <strong>count the units</strong>. If it's six units one way and nine the other, you just count them out.</li>

</ul>

<p>If it's a square plan, as we've been using, you count out the same number on each axis. You don't have to land exactly on the blue lines if you choose to work somewhere between them.</p>

<h3>Using Square Graph Paper</h3>

<p>You can even use <strong>square graph paper</strong> by drawing to and through corners. The <strong>45-degree isometric position</strong> looks a bit awkward, but by choosing which corners to intersect, you can create other angles.</p>

<h3>Limitations of Isometric Perspective</h3>

<p>But graph paper has its limits:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Isometric perspective</strong> doesn't give us the <strong>realism</strong> that we get when we bring in <strong>vanishing points</strong>.</li>

<li>It has one other limitation that's a big deal in this course: isometrics only create forms in a few fixed positions.</li>

</ul>

<p>But so do these examples I've drawn using vanishing points. That's okay. Until you learn how to place a plan in perspective on your own, you can use these templates.</p>

<h2>Next Steps</h2>

<p>We'll use this thinking in our next lesson.</p>

<h2>Returning to Orthographic Views</h2>

<p><strong>Back to orthographics</strong>. The <strong>three basic views</strong> on the three basic axes are the three basic one-side-at-a-time truths of how a thing takes up space.</p>

<h2>Final Encouragement</h2>

<p>Draw from these plans, or if you're ambitious, <strong>create an orthographic of anything you want to learn to draw from imagination</strong>.</p>
