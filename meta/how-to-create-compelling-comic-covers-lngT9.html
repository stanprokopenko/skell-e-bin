<p>My name is Eric Gist, though you'll often see me credited as <strong>EMGIST</strong>. I've worked on various comic book covers over the years. Some of my favorites include covers for <strong>Fantastic Four</strong>, <strong>Iron Fist</strong>, <strong>Wolverine</strong>, and <strong>Hulk</strong>. Mostly, I've done variant covers—the secondary covers—for different issues.</p>

<h2>My Favorite Covers</h2>

<p>Picking a favorite cover is tough because I like them for different reasons. It's probably between my <strong>Fantastic Four</strong> cover and my <strong>Hulk</strong> cover.</p>

<p>The <strong>Hulk</strong> cover was really cool because it was an action scene, which I don't often do. It featured a classic fight between Wolverine and Hulk—a scene almost every comic artist wants to tackle at some point. Plus, it was a <strong>zombie Wolverine</strong>, which was pretty cool since I'm known for doing zombies.</p>

<p>The <strong>Fantastic Four</strong> cover was a lot of fun because there was more storytelling involved. With more characters, each having their own characteristics and the whole family dynamic, trying to capture that in a single image was a good challenge and something I really enjoyed.</p>

<h2>Starting in Comics</h2>

<p>My first cover was in 2007, so I've been doing this for about <strong>15 years</strong>. I started working for Marvel around <strong>2016</strong>, with a series of covers for the <strong>Haunted Mansion</strong> series. My first real Marvel character cover was for their anniversary issue of <strong>Crazy</strong> in <strong>2019</strong>. So, I've been working specifically on Marvel on-brand covers for about four or five years.</p>

<h3>Early Interest in Comics</h3>

<p>The first thing I wanted to do in art was draw comic books. I was into comics from the time I was a little kid—around <strong>eight years old</strong>. I wanted to do interiors at first, and during the 90s boom, everyone was excited about comics as they started becoming more mainstream. I worked on doing interiors, but I was terrible. I did submissions every month to all the companies and got tons of rejection letters—some of which I still have.</p>

<h2>Transition to Cover Art</h2>

<p>I started training with <strong>Jeff Watts</strong> and found out I had more of a knack for <strong>single-image storytelling</strong>. I still loved the genre of comics but wanted to get more into painting and cover art. I started pursuing covers, and it took me about <strong>ten years to get good enough</strong>, and then about another <strong>five years to catch on</strong> doing them.</p>

<p>I got into covers by taking my work to Comic-Con, starting off showing interior samples, but realizing I had more talent for cover art. It's also tough to do painted interiors—not many artists do it, and those who do are amazing. I've only done covers for comics. I've been asked to do interiors a couple of times, but it wasn't anything that grabbed my interest. If I'm going to do interiors, it has to be something I'm really excited about.</p>

<h2>My Artistic Style</h2>

<p>Broadly speaking, my style is often dictated by how I feel about the characters—not whether I like or dislike them, but how I interpret them. If there's something I'm known for, it's definitely <strong>deep shadows</strong>, <strong>high contrast</strong>, and <strong>moodier</strong>, <strong>noir-like</strong> images with a bit of a <strong>horror feel</strong>. Something a little darker is what I'm known for.</p>

<p>In the last year or two, I've been branching out into some brighter colored stuff, especially when I've been asked to do brighter characters. The <strong>Fantastic Four</strong>, for example, aren't known for being dark and moody, so that was fun. I went in a sort of <strong>Norman Rockwell</strong> direction with that, as he's one of my favorite artists. With my <strong>Iron Fist</strong> cover, I chose a brighter palette to show the history of the character and the passing of the torch.</p>

<h2>Being Versatile</h2>

<p>I don't want to get stuck doing the same thing over and over. I want to be one of those artists who gets asked to do just about everything. I aim to create images that <strong>stand out in people's minds</strong>—something <strong>iconic</strong> that they'll never forget. I admire artists who balance an iconic image with storytelling.</p>

<h2>Should You Specialize or Be Well-Rounded?</h2>

<p>That's a tough question. It depends on what you want to do, but I would definitely <strong>specialize</strong>—at least at first. As far as specializing in what, that depends on where your passion lies and where your natural abilities are. Get <strong>really good at one thing first</strong>, rather than being mediocre at several things. Once you've got a good handle on your specialty, you can start to branch out.</p>

<p>Comics definitely seem to be heading in the direction of the <strong>well-rounded artist</strong>. When I was a kid, there were pencilers, inkers, and colorists—each area was its own specialty. Now, those lines are getting blurrier. Art directors and editors like to see someone who can do it all. But I still recommend specializing at first.</p>

<h2>Advice for Aspiring Artists</h2>

<h3>Improving Cover Art Skills</h3>

<p>To get better at making covers, <strong>study the people who are good at it</strong>. Don't limit yourself to contemporary artists—go back through the long history of illustration. Study cover artists from the past, not just comic covers, but also narrative painters like <strong>Bouguereau</strong>, <strong>Caravaggio</strong>, and <strong>Rembrandt</strong>.</p>

<p>Work on your <strong>fundamentals</strong> and <strong>make covers</strong>. If you want to get better at golf, you play golf. If you want to do covers, make covers. <strong>Make some bad covers—get them out of your system</strong>. Do a lot of them—that's how you're going to get better.</p>

<h3>Importance of Fundamentals</h3>

<p>Fundamentals in my mind include <strong>figure drawing</strong>, which can be broken down into basic drawing, fundamental forms, fundamental lighting, and anatomy. Beyond that, you want a good understanding of <strong>color theory</strong>, <strong>perspective</strong>, and <strong>composition</strong>.</p>

<p>When it comes to being good, they're all important. You can't really prioritize one over the other, except that figure drawing is more important because comics are about figures—<strong>people first and foremost</strong>. If you can draw a cool, dynamic figure, you can get away with a lot of sins in other areas.</p>

<p>I always tell people: <strong>Be a jack of all trades, master of one.</strong> It's good to at least be familiar with everything so that when you're communicating with your inker, colorist, or writer, you come from a place of knowledge.</p>

<h3>Mistakes to Avoid</h3>

<p>I wouldn't necessarily avoid studying or looking at anything because there's no such thing as <strong>bad knowledge</strong> or <strong>bad influences</strong>—it's all how you're going to use them. Sometimes, what people would call a bad influence can actually add uniqueness to your work.</p>

<p>Maybe avoid getting too caught up in <strong>forcing style</strong>. Don't try too much to be someone else. Have your influences, but let them find their way into your work <strong>organically</strong>. <strong>Be yourself.</strong></p>

<h2>Challenges and Limitations</h2>

<p>Of course, it's limiting to try and fit as much of a story as you can into one image or represent an entire plot line with one image—but <strong>limiting in a good way</strong>. Limitations make you be <strong>clever</strong>. They make you think through a problem and come up with an interesting solution.</p>

<p>The more creative a solution you have to come up with, the more likely you are to be <strong>original</strong>. Anything that makes you <strong>dig deeper</strong> is great for creativity, which is why <strong>thumbnails</strong> are such an important part of the process.</p>

<p>A friend once said that <strong>the first five thumbnails you do are always someone else's idea</strong>. So, you have to get to that point of doing 10, 15, 20 sketches. As you get more experienced, you start skipping over the obvious ideas.</p>

<h2>Reflecting on My Career</h2>

<p>I started doing comic covers when I already had quite a bit of knowledge and experience under my belt. I wish I knew how <strong>good you had to be</strong>. Each level you go up, especially in comics, there's this <strong>tier system</strong>.</p>

<p>I was 17 or 18 when I was doing pages and submitting them to Marvel, DC, and Image—which was just ridiculous, but I didn't know any better. Maybe I benefited from my own ignorance because it kept me motivated and producing work.</p>

<p>Now, I'm doing covers and sometimes I still look at my work and wish it was better. Because it's on the rack next to people like <strong>Alex Ross</strong> and others. You don't want to make it all about the sales, but it's part of the job. <strong>Your job is to sell comics.</strong></p>
