<h2>Understanding Illusions</h2>

<p>Creating depth involves techniques like <strong>overlap</strong> and <strong>atmosphere</strong> (things fading into the background), which are straightforward. However, <strong>foreshortening</strong>, <strong>diminution</strong>, and <strong>convergence to vanishing points</strong> require practice.</p>

<h2>The Key Skill: Simplifying Forms</h2>

<p>To master advanced techniques, focus on <strong>reducing complex forms into simple ones</strong> you can draw in any position. This skill is essential for drawing from imagination rather than copying.</p>

<h3>Copying vs. Understanding</h3>

<p>Copying details helps you notice specifics but doesn't enable you to redraw in a new position from memory. Simplify the object and practice repositioning it without direct observation.</p>

<h2>Drawing Objects in Any Position</h2>

<p><strong>Draw the object as a simplified form</strong>, like a box, then draw it again in a different position. This exercise helps you grasp the structure and master the <strong>line systems</strong> that determine perspective.</p>

<h3>The Importance of Line Systems</h3>

<p>Understanding a box's three line systems is crucial. Once you position a box, these lines solve all other lines. This concept applies to both objects and settings.</p>

<h2>Start with Simple Forms</h2>

<p>Before tackling complex forms, practice with simple, blocky ones. Objects with many parts can overwhelm beginners. Begin with shapes like <strong>blocks, wedges, cylinders, toruses, and spheres</strong>.</p>

<h3>Notes on Spheres</h3>

<p>While spheres are simple, placing precise ellipses on them is advanced. Accurate ellipses stem from understanding boxes. So, mastering boxes first aids in drawing spheres.</p>

<h2>Introducing the Blob Approach</h2>

<p>Try the <strong>Blob Approach</strong>, a method of starting with a shape and adding cross-contour lines to define it. This helps you sculpt a simplified version of your object.</p>

<h2>Your Project Challenge</h2>

<p>Challenge yourself:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Choose a subject</strong>, preferably boxy.</li>

<li><strong>Place it in a three-quarter view</strong> and draw it as if boxed.</li>

<li><strong>Avoid detail</strong> , focus on form.</li>

<li><strong>Draw it again in different positions</strong> without looking at the object.</li>

<li>Repeat at least three times with varied positions.</li>

</ul>

<p>This prepares you to draw anything, enhancing your skill in visualizing forms from different angles.</p>

<h2>Upcoming Lessons</h2>

<p>We'll dive into the science of form: <strong>orthos</strong>, <strong>axes</strong>, <strong>eye levels</strong>, <strong>picture planes</strong>, and more. Experimenting now primes you for these concepts.</p>
