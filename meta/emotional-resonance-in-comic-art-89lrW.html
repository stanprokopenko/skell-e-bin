<h2>Discovering Comics and Early Career</h2>

<p>As a kid, I <strong>loved film</strong>. I was one of those kids who would unplug our little black and white TV, sneak it under the covers, and watch movies like <em>2001: A Space Odyssey</em> at midnight. My aspiration was to get into <strong>film school</strong>, but like many, I couldn't afford it at the time.</p>

<p>My cousin came in and said, "Hey, there's this convention downtown, San Diego Comic-Con." He dragged me over there with my portfolio. I was <strong>very lucky</strong>, it was my first San Diego Comic-Con, and that year, <strong>every single editor</strong> from Marvel was there on a talent search. They were looking for talent.</p>

<h2>Mentorship from Karl Potts</h2>

<p>At Comic-Con, I met senior editor <strong>Karl Potts</strong>, who saw potential in me. I'm very grateful to Karl because at the time, and still today, the business is too busy to pick up somebody who's 80-90% of the way there. Usually, they'd say, "You're pretty good, but you're almost there. You need a few more things to learn. Come back next year."</p>

<p>But Karl was different. He got my number, and every month he would bug me for new samples. After a short time, I guess he saw that I really had the potential, and really wanted it. All of a sudden, I got a FedEx package from Marvel, it was <strong>The Five C's of Cinematography</strong>, one of the best books to learn how to tell a story visually. He said Once you figure it all out, I'll give you a job.</p>

<p>I took the challenge and learned <strong>storytelling</strong>.</p>

<h2>From Inking to Penciling</h2>

<p>I always wanted to be the <strong>penciler</strong>, everybody wants to be the top dog. When I came to Marvel, I learned that you had to actually tell a story, you couldn't just get by drawing pretty pictures. While studying cinematography and storytelling, I started <strong>inking</strong> to make some money and help artists meet their deadlines by getting their work into a printable form.</p>

<p>As I learned storytelling, I got into being a <strong>penciler</strong>, drawing the actual drawings and telling the story. Because comics is a small art core, if you showed inklings for anything else, opportunities opened up for you.</p>

<h2>Creating Bishop and Founding Image Comics</h2>

<p>On the X-books, I was asked to create a character named <strong>Bishop</strong>. I started <strong>writing</strong>, and as we went into Image Comics, we were now on the production side and the retail side too. We had to prepare our books, we couldn't just produce and do the work. So we learned <strong>retail</strong>, <strong>distribution</strong>, <strong>promotion</strong>, and that's a big part today, learning everything.</p>

<p>Now, I am, you could say, an <strong>all-around artist</strong>. I have done everything. When we were at Image, I was the computer geek there. Along with Brian Hamblyn, we figured out how to use <strong>Photoshop for comics</strong>. I'm really proud of how far that's gone because when we started, there was no such thing as a digital colorist.</p>

<p>That's how I started in the industry, first inking, just to make some money while I was learning storytelling. I learned storytelling, got on <em>The Punisher</em>, <em>X-Men</em>, and onward. My whole run on <em>Uncanny X-Men</em> was my first shot on the X-books, and it was the number one book at the time, so I had to <strong>impress</strong>.</p>

<p>One day, Bob Harris, the editor, calls up and says, "Hey, Wils, your team needs a new X-Man." Just make him big and strong and cool like Wolverine. So I did that. I'd never done it before, never even thought about it because I wanted to be a movie director, I wasn't going to be on the writing side. But if I could <strong>impress</strong> the editors, they would give me more jobs. So I just did it.</p>

<h2>Art as a Universal Field</h2>

<p><strong>Art is a very big field</strong>. It encompasses singing, dancing, production design, drawing, film, animation, everything. To have talent in any one of those fields is to have <strong>art talent</strong>. Once you have any kind of talent, like me getting into comics as an inker, and if you have the <strong>drive</strong>, you can easily get into other areas like penciling or character creation. <strong>Everything in art is the same</strong>.</p>

<p>I think that's one of the most important things for young aspiring artists, to first be <strong>recognized</strong>. Not that you're a pro yet, that's going to take time. But finding out that you've got the <strong>talent</strong>, that you're <strong>creative</strong>. As I've learned through my 40 years, it is always that first big step.</p>

<p>An aspiring artist could be drawing and struggling for five years in their little bat cave rooms. They could be kind of good, but they don't know, they only have themselves. When a professional artist sees your work and says, "Hey, you're pretty good," that aspiring artist, <strong>boom</strong>! Just that confidence, just that kick.</p>

<h2>My Approach to Art: Focus Over Theory</h2>

<p>My answer is not your typical art answer. A lot of people will go into theories like the rule of thirds, or the golden ratio. <strong>We don't have the time to do that</strong>. I draw an issue of <em>Uncanny X-Men</em>, and I'm bringing in our new X-Man, Bishop. I've got to design his character, his costume, figure out his power, and as a writer, I need to determine how he fits into the story. I have to set up all the production locations like the X-Men office, then do all the key art with the cover, and I have to do it in <strong>four weeks</strong>.</p>

<p>You give that same load to the best film crew and director, they get four years.</p>

<p>So what I've focused on is <strong>direction</strong> and <strong>focus</strong>. Let's say you have a team of characters, and they're all fighting the enemy. Cyclops is the leader, and he's barking orders. So he's the <strong>focal point</strong>. You have to choose.</p>

<p>When I draw an enemy over here, I'm going to have his arms pointing at Scott (Cyclops). If I have smoke billowing, I'm going to make sure the smoke starts pointing back to Scott. If I have pillars or boards hanging down, I will angle them so they point to Scott. I'll have the rest of the X-Men, no matter what they do, their poses and gazes will point the reader to the focal point, Scott. It's all <strong>direction</strong>, it's all <strong>focus</strong>.</p>

<h2>Embracing Digital Tools for Efficiency and Freedom</h2>

<p>I'm proud to say I'm one of the <strong>geekiest of the geeks</strong>. Back in 1989, I bought my first desktop computer just to do <strong>ray tracing</strong>, just so I could build models because I knew when I got into directing movies, I wanted to do special effects. When <strong>ZBrush</strong> and <strong>Blender</strong> came in, I got into all that.</p>

<p>You might think I do everything digitally, and I've done a lot of professional work digitally. But <strong>efficiency is the name of the game</strong> in any professional world. I do all my <strong>layouts</strong> digitally. I work out the anatomy until the outline is exactly what I want. Once that outline is set, I print that blue line onto actual 11x17 art boards and then, in "real life," ink it.</p>

<p>All the underlying work is already done digitally, so I can concentrate on shading and spot blacks. If I make a mistake, I print out another one. I don't have to redo the buildup work.</p>

<p>For artists, that gives you a lot of <strong>freedom</strong>. No matter how good I was at the time, there's always that fear, "Am I going to mess up?" But if you've got that backup of And the best thing is, because you've got that backup, you can <strong>experiment</strong>.</p>

<p>I think that's one of the reasons we're seeing so many different styles, forms, and experiments with different things and mediums. The reliability and efficiency of digital tools help build out the foundational blocks of anything you can work on.</p>

<h2>My Cover Process and Storytelling</h2>

<p>My cover process has changed over the years. Back in the day, you didn't get covers, you were the artist on the book, you did the interiors, so you got the cover. Nowadays, the cover has become such prime real estate, so they bring in <strong>"top guns"</strong> to do that.</p>

<p>Back then, because you were the interior artist, you read the plot. You might have already drawn that character, so you know the intricacies of it, and more importantly, you know there was this one shot you really wanted to do but the plot didn't allow it. So now, you've got this cover that really connects to that book and that story.</p>

<p>Nowadays, especially with multiple variants, you're called in to do your best shot as you. A lot of times, they don't even give you a brief on what the story is. They just tell you, "Daredevil's fighting the Hulk, have fun," which is cool to a point.</p>

<p>But because I came from film and wanted to tell <strong>visual stories</strong>, for me, the story that I'm drawing, even if it's just one cover image, is important. I've drawn Wolverine five million times, and after a while, you want to try something else.</p>

<p>So that something else is, for example, Wolverine is mad and going at it with both guns blazing, but he doesn't want to kill this person. He has a long history with him, he knew him before he was a bad guy. He doesn't want to do it, but for the sake of society and the greater good, he's got to take this guy down. So now, I'm going to try to show <strong>pain in his face</strong>, pain that he's going to take someone out that he knows and doesn't want to, but he knows he has to.</p>

<p>Even if it doesn't come across to the viewer, for me drawing it, that's now a different drawing than the last time I did this. That's how I approach it. A lot of people will call it the <strong>acting</strong>, the <strong>pose</strong>. It's not just that, it's <strong>what's that story</strong>. That's what excites me more, and keeps the energy up when I'm doing work.</p>

<p>I prefer to send in <strong>one image</strong>, the one I want to do, and then ask, "So what do you think of this?" I'm hoping for the editor to come back with a back and forth. Between an artist and the editor, I push for that kind of interaction.</p>

<h2>The Impact of Art</h2>

<p>One of the images I'm most proud of is a cover of <strong>Storm</strong> crying in the rain. My editor at the time, Suzanne Gaffney, said Storm was getting a reputation as being the Ice Queen, a competent, strong leader, but she never shows emotions. People don't warm up to her. She asked, "Can you do something about that?"</p>

<p>We ended up with the half-shot of Storm crying in the rain. Up front, it just looks like the X-Men leader is in the rain, but if you look closely, you see a couple of crooked streaks. When I did that, I was just following Suzanne's lead, showing another side of Storm, an <strong>emotional side</strong>.</p>

<p>To this day, I'm proud that I can go to conventions, and people from all walks of life, people who felt like they were outsiders, who were nerds, people who were ignored or bullied, the LGBTQ community, people from different ethnicities, look at that cover and see themselves. They say, "That's me too." I cry, and people don't know I'm crying. **"</p>

<p>That wasn't my original intent for societal effect. My intent was just for Storm. But <strong>art is such that it can be interpreted beyond</strong> by whoever's looking at it and whatever is true in their life. That has to be the number one cover that I am really proud to have done because it has now morphed into something else. And I really think that's what <strong>real art</strong> is about.</p>
