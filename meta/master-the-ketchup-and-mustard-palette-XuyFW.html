<p>I like to keep things simple and not intimidating, especially when it comes to my palette. Often, I find myself with too many colors, so for this session, I'm using a <strong>limited palette</strong>. I humorously call it "ketchup and mustard," instead of the Zorn palette. This palette includes Winsor Newton's yellow ocher pale (mustard), alizarin crimson (ketchup), ivory black, and titanium white. Winsor Newton is my preferred brand due to its consistency and potency, though it's not the most expensive option. I recommend using cheaper colors if needed, as some like cadmium can be very costly. Using a limited palette can still yield lifelike flesh tones and various grays, saving money in the process.</p>

<h2>Brushes and Tools</h2>

<p>I purchase my art supplies from Dick Blick, despite their high prices, and use their Master Stroke finest red sable brushes. My brush collection ranges from number seven to number one, with twos, threes, and fours being the most used. I have some old brushes, including a rare mongoose hair brush, which are now expensive and hard to find. For those on a budget, I suggest using white synthetic sables from stores like Michaels or Hobby Lobby. Avoid bristle brushes for this technique, softer brushes are more suitable. A number three filbert brush can also be useful for certain strokes.</p>

<h2>Painting Medium</h2>

<p>I use a mixture of walnut oil and Gamsol as my painting medium. This mixture dries faster and is less toxic. My typical mixture is three parts Gamsol to one part walnut oil, but I adjust it to my preference. I cover the medium to prevent drying and reduce inhalation of fumes, which allows it to last 2-4 days before needing a new mix.</p>

<h2>Palette and Mixing Tools</h2>

<p>For mixing, I use a palette knife that I've had for 25 years. It's great for mixing on the palette. I have a few palette knives of different sizes for applying paint, but the main one is just for mixing. To keep my glass palette clean, I use a paint scraper from Home Depot. My glass palette is painted underneath with a neutral gray and is on a board with duct tape edges. I've been using it for 30-35 years, and it shows a buildup of paint over time.</p>

<h2>Personal Insights</h2>

<p>Visitors to my studio often find the accumulated paint on my palette interesting. It reflects my 45 years of painting experience.</p>
