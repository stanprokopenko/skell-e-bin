<p><strong>Background Preparation</strong></p>

<p>When working with a dark background, start with <strong>black as a base color</strong>. This simplifies the process by avoiding overanalysis of other hues. Ensure the background complements the foreground, making it interesting but not overly distracting. As you move away from the focal point, allow for some <strong>color variation</strong> to add depth and interest.</p>

<p><strong>Brush Techniques</strong></p>

<p>For broader strokes, use a <strong>larger brush</strong>. This helps in covering more area efficiently and allows for some color variation. When working near detailed elements, like a cat, switch to a <strong>more precise brush</strong>. Control the paint spread to mimic watercolor effects, especially towards the bottom of the painting. A <strong>maul stick</strong> can provide stability when working on delicate areas, particularly in smaller paintings.</p>

<p><strong>Color Mixing and Application</strong></p>

<p>Introduce <strong>white and gray</strong> to your palette to maintain a dark tone while adding interest. Use <strong>clean pieces of color</strong> to avoid muddiness and maintain clarity in your mixes. Pre-mix your original colors to easily adjust light and dark values without losing control. This approach helps in maintaining consistency and vibrancy in your painting.</p>

<p><strong>Creating Depth and Realism</strong></p>

<p>Apply the <strong>Rembrandt egg principle</strong> to create a sense of roundness and depth in the subject's face. This involves focusing on refining halftones and drawing, using a range of values from light to dark. Add <strong>alizarin crimson</strong> to halftones for a richer color mix and smoother transitions. Consider using <strong>pools of light</strong> rather than planes to create a glowing effect on the face, enhancing the painting's realism.</p>

<p><strong>Observing and Adjusting</strong></p>

<p>Continuously observe your reference photo for varying halftones and adjust accordingly. Adjust the lightness of halftones to match the lighting conditions, such as side lighting. Reflect <strong>warm light</strong> in areas like the iris, considering the subject's eye color and surrounding reflections. This attention to detail helps in achieving a natural and lifelike appearance.</p>

<p><strong>Subtle Details and Finishing Touches</strong></p>

<p>Introduce <strong>subtle color variations</strong>, like pinks, to add a human flesh feel and avoid a plastic appearance. Add <strong>darker cores to shadows</strong> for depth, using colors like alizarin crimson. Observe and replicate subtle value changes and contrasts in the subject's features. These finishing touches can significantly enhance the overall effect of your painting, making it more engaging and realistic.</p>
