<h2>The Importance of Simplicity</h2>

<p>When working on notan thumbnails, simplicity and clarity are essential. By limiting ourselves to just <strong>two or three values</strong>, we can focus on the fundamental value structure of a composition without getting bogged down by unnecessary details.</p>

<h2>Prioritizing Values</h2>

<h3>Choosing What to Emphasize</h3>

<p>In a two-value notan, we need to decide whether to emphasize <strong>lighting</strong> or <strong>objects</strong>. If we add a third value, we can communicate more information, but it's crucial to choose whatâ€™s most important.</p>

<p>For example, if the <strong>lighting</strong> is the key element, we might group all the <strong>shadows</strong> together and highlight the areas hit by <strong>light</strong>. If the objects themselves are important, we might use the mid-tone to distinguish them from the background.</p>

<h3>Grouping Lights and Shadows</h3>

<p>It's often helpful to group <strong>shadows into one value</strong> and <strong>lights into another</strong>. Within the lights, we can use an additional value to show highlights or subtle variations. This approach helps to keep the composition clear and directs the viewer's eye to the <strong>focal points</strong>.</p>

<h2>Common Mistakes to Avoid</h2>

<h3>Adding Too Much Detail</h3>

<p>One of the biggest pitfalls is spending too much time on <strong>details</strong> in a thumbnail. Remember, <strong>thumbnails</strong> are meant to be <strong>quick</strong> and <strong>simple</strong>. Adding intricate details can detract from the overall composition and consume unnecessary time.</p>

<h3>Overusing Gradations</h3>

<p>Another mistake is using too many gradations or trying to render soft edges in a thumbnail. At this stage, it's better to focus on the <strong>big shapes</strong> and <strong>hard edges</strong>. We can refine edges and add gradations in the final rendering.</p>

<h3>Not Clearly Separating Values</h3>

<p>Failing to clearly separate <strong>lights</strong>, <strong>mid-tones</strong>, and <strong>shadows</strong> can make a thumbnail <strong>confusing</strong>. It's important to have <strong>clean value separations</strong> to enhance readability and ensure the composition communicates effectively.</p>

<h2>Tips for Effective Notan Thumbnails</h2>

<h3>Work Small and Efficiently</h3>

<p>Keep your thumbnails <strong>small</strong> and spend no more than <strong>five to ten minutes</strong> on each. This forces you to focus on the essential elements without getting lost in details.</p>

<h3>Simplify Shapes</h3>

<p>Focus on simplifying <strong>shapes</strong> to their basic forms. Avoid drawing every leaf or texture. Instead, capture the overall silhouette and major forms.</p>

<h3>Make Deliberate Choices</h3>

<p>Be <strong>intentional</strong> with your value decisions. Decide what's <strong>most important</strong> in your composition and use your limited values to emphasize those elements.</p>

<h3>Limit the Number of Values</h3>

<p>When you only have two or three values, you must prioritize what's most important. Each additional value should communicate the next most significant element in your composition.</p>

<h3>Use Bold and Clean Lines</h3>

<p>In your thumbnails, use bold and clean lines to define edges and shapes. Avoid sketchy or scratchy lines that can make your thumbnail look messy and obscure the composition.</p>

<h2>Understanding Value Hierarchy</h2>

<p>Recognize that each additional value allows you to communicate more information. The first value separation highlights the most important aspect, such as the overall <strong>lighting</strong>. The second value can introduce form or separate important elements. Be mindful of how you use each value to build a hierarchy of importance in your composition.</p>

<h2>Experiment and Explore</h2>

<p>Don't be afraid to create <strong>multiple thumbnails</strong> exploring different value arrangements. Each version can help you understand what works best for your composition.</p>

<p>By focusing on simplicity, clarity, and deliberate value choices, you can create effective notan thumbnails that serve as a strong foundation for your final artwork. Remember, the goal is to explore and plan your composition efficiently, not to create a finished rendering at this stage.</p>
