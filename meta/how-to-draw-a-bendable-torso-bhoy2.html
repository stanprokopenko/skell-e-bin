<h2>Why the Torso Matters</h2>

<p>You deal with the <strong>largest area</strong> of the figure when you draw the torso. It supports and connects the legs and arms, so it’s vital to consider how the legs fit into the hips and how the shoulders support the arms. You want your figure to feel <strong>balanced</strong> and able to move freely.</p>

<h2>Breaking It Down: Hips, Waist, and Rib Cage</h2>

<p>Think of the torso as a combination of <strong>three main structures</strong>:

- <strong>Hips</strong> (connecting into the legs and acting like a fulcrum)<br />

- <strong>Waist</strong> (the narrower middle area)<br />

- <strong>Rib Cage</strong> (the broader upper section)  </p>

<p>You can treat the torso as one <strong>tubular shape</strong> or break it into simpler shapes. Even when it looks like just one tube, plan where the hips will separate so you can show <strong>articulation</strong> and a sense of movement.</p>

<h2>Hips as a Fulcrum</h2>

<p>The hips are the <strong>pivot point</strong> of the body. They let the upper torso bend in different directions and help the legs support and propel the figure. If you don’t separate the hips structure from the upper torso, the figure can look stiff and unable to bend. Always show how the legs connect directly into the <strong>hip area</strong>.</p>

<h2>Shoulders as Corners</h2>

<p>Even though shoulders might flow with gentle S-curves, see them as <strong>corners</strong> where the body changes direction. This helps your drawing look more structured, and gives the arms a natural place to attach. Don’t get distracted by wide shoulders, start with a <strong>waist-wide</strong> block, then adjust shoulder width later.</p>

<h2>Simple Shapes First</h2>

<p>When in doubt, <strong>simplify</strong>. Begin with <strong>two-dimensional shapes</strong> like a rectangle or basic tube for the waist-wide torso. Then shape it into something more specific:

1. Block in a simple rectangle or tube.<br />

2. Mark the <strong>center line</strong> (“spine” line) down the middle.<br />

3. Add slight outward bulges to separate the <strong>rib cage</strong> from the <strong>hips</strong>.<br />

4. Indicate curves where you want an hourglass shape or wider shoulders.  </p>

<p>This approach gives you structure without locking the pose in place.</p>

<h2>Front and Near-Front Views</h2>

<p>A straight-on or near-front view of the torso can look very <strong>tube-like</strong>. Even so, be aware that the rib cage often sits a bit <strong>forward</strong>, and the abdomen can arch forward or back. Observe the soft <strong>accordion</strong> effect:<br />

- Rib cage may angle forward.<br />

- Waist can curve.<br />

- Hips can tilt back slightly.</p>

<h2>A Note on Symmetry</h2>

<p>The torso is <strong>bilaterally symmetrical</strong> from left to right. If you’re looking at a straight front or back view, the center line is vertical and straight. If the torso twists, the symmetry changes, but keep the general concept of <strong>mirroring</strong> in mind. The limbs, on the other hand, are never mirror images. Arms and legs can swing in different directions.</p>

<h2>Managing Perspective</h2>

<p>For now, avoid deep perspective if you’re a beginner. Work with poses that tilt a bit side to side or forward/backward, but not so much that the torso is in heavy foreshortening. Once you feel confident, you can explore more complicated angles.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p>Focus on making the <strong>hips articulate</strong> separately from the rib cage and waist. Start simple, add bulges or corners, and position the center line. Plan where the arms attach at the <strong>shoulder corners</strong>, and allow the legs to feel solid at the <strong>hip fulcrum</strong>. This approach helps your figure look natural, balanced, and free to move.</p>
