<h2>What's in Premium?</h2>

<p>Learn how to blend solid fundamentals (anatomy, perspective, and light) with creative intuition to shape your art. We focus on composition, exploring how to see like an artist and balance technical accuracy with personal expression. You’ll practice “filters” (like line quality, value, and emotional intent) one at a time, building mastery through repeated “iterations.” Our aim is to help you develop a clear, structured process for creating compelling visuals that communicate meaning and emotion.</p>
