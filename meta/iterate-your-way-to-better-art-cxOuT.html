<h2>Start Simple</h2>

<p>I begin by <strong>making my drawings as simple as possible</strong>. I focus on one or two things at a time, such as basic shapes or simple connections between forms. I allow proportions and details to be off, if it helps me keep the process manageable. By focusing on simple shapes, like tubes, boxes, or even flattened two-dimensional versions of those forms, I reduce the complexity and build a strong foundation.</p>

<h2>Permission to Be Bad</h2>

<p>I give myself <strong>permission to be imperfect</strong>. In the beginning, or whenever I tackle challenging poses, I know things will look off. I can’t let that stop me. Just like learning to walk, I give myself room to fail, stumble, and try again. Each drawing is a stepping stone that pushes me to improve over time.</p>

<h2>Iterate and Chunk</h2>

<p><strong>Iteration</strong> is key. If I don’t like how something looks, I draw it again, maybe several times. Sometimes I’ll work on the entire figure repeatedly, and other times I’ll just focus on <em>one part</em>, like an arm or leg, until I see improvement. By narrowing my focus and <strong>chunking</strong> the problem down, I get faster feedback. That helps me adjust my shapes or angles without feeling overwhelmed by the entire figure every time.</p>

<h2>Adjusting Shapes</h2>

<p>To build forms, I start with <strong>corners and curves</strong>. I imagine simple connections where one shape ends and another begins. I might curve a line, put in a corner, or add a small overlap. Each little “hook” or “bump” tells me one form has ended and a new one has started. If I want more character, I experiment by adding slight tilts and angles, testing out how tapered or curved a limb should be. It's all about small decisions that add up.</p>

<h2>Flatten or Simplify</h2>

<p>If a pose is too complicated, with wild angles or overlapping limbs, I look for ways to <strong>simplify</strong> the three-dimensional complexity. I might treat the figure like it’s a flattened cut-out, focusing on two-dimensional shapes. I can always come back to add perspective and form later. At this stage, I just need to keep it <strong>clean and clear</strong>.</p>

<h2>Let Your Skills Evolve</h2>

<p>I accept that <strong>today’s drawing</strong> is not going to be as good as the one I’ll create in a few months. As my eye becomes more sophisticated, things I once liked might start to look awkward to me. That’s natural growth. By sticking to simple fundamentals and harnessing iteration, I gradually find <em>my</em> way of seeing and expressing the figure.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p>I remind myself that these methods, <strong>permission to fail</strong>, simple shapes, chunking, and iteration, are the path to steady progress. I'm less overwhelmed, I build confidence and I discover my personal vision. Above all, I have fun exploring and finding beauty in each pose. Let’s celebrate every small win, and I’ll see you in the next lesson!</p>
