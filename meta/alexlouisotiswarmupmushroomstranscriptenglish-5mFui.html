<p>Hey guys, before we dive into the line category of the course, I want to share a little exercise with you. It's a great way to warm up your hand and get used to drawing nice, fluid lines.</p>

<h2>The Traditional Ellipse Practice</h2>

<p>Most artists, including myself, have spent years practicing ellipses by simply drawing them randomly on a page. You know, filling up a whole page with ellipses of various sizes and placements. This does have value, you're moving your hand, getting blood flowing, and warming up physically. But as I was doodling with my son the other day, I stumbled upon a much better exercise.</p>

<h2>The Mario Mushroom Exercise</h2>

<p>My son asked me to draw a Mario mushroom, and as I was drawing it, I realized it's the perfect exercise to practice <strong>ellipses</strong>. It's not only a fun way to warm up your hand, but it also challenges you to draw the <strong>correct ellipse</strong>, not just a random one. This way, you have something to judge your ellipses against.</p>

<h3>The Eight Ellipses in the Mushroom</h3>

<p>The Mario mushroom consists of eight different ellipses:</p>

<ol>

<li><strong>The Connector</strong>: A long ellipse where the head connects to the body.</li>

<li><strong>The Cap</strong>: The top part of the mushroom.</li>

<li><strong>The Body</strong>: The main body ellipse.</li>

<li><strong>The Eyes</strong>: Two ellipses for the eyes.</li>

<li><strong>The Center Dot</strong>: A small circle in the middle of the cap.</li>

<li><strong>The Side Dots</strong>: Two ellipses on the sides of the cap.</li>

</ol>

<p>While it might not be an exact replica of the Mario mushroom, it gives us a fun structure to practice drawing precise ellipses.</p>

<h2>Practicing Pressure and Placement</h2>

<p>This exercise focuses on two main things: <strong>pressure</strong> and <strong>placement</strong>.</p>

<ul>

<li>

<p><strong>Pressure</strong>: Adjusting the pressure to make the line darker where the ellipse is visible and lighter where it wraps around. For instance, on the first ellipse (the connector), I make the top part of the line darker and lighten up as I go around the back.</p>

</li>

<li>

<p><strong>Placement</strong>: Aligning the ellipses correctly on the page. You need to ensure that the points of intersection between the ellipses are accurate.</p>

</li>

</ul>

<p>I like to <strong>ghost</strong> the lines before putting them down, moving my hand slightly above the paper to get a feel for the motion before drawing the line.</p>

<h2>Varying Proportions and Angles</h2>

<p>To keep it fun and to get better at drawing different ellipses, play with the proportions:</p>

<ul>

<li>Draw mushrooms that are taller or wider.</li>

<li>Change the size of the cap or the body.</li>

<li>Tilt the mushroom in different directions.</li>

<li>Vary the size, draw big ones and small ones.</li>

<li>Adjust the placement and size of the eyes and dots.</li>

</ul>

<p>By changing things up, you're not just practicing the same ellipses over and over. You're challenging yourself to draw different ellipses <strong>intentionally</strong>.</p>

<h2>Tips for Effective Practice</h2>

<ul>

<li>

<p><strong>Imagine Before Drawing</strong>: Before putting down a line, imagine the ellipse you want to draw. Ghost it a few times, then execute the stroke.</p>

</li>

<li>

<p><strong>Relax Your Hand</strong>: If your hand starts to hurt, you're probably gripping the pencil too hard. Stretch your hand, take a break if needed, and try to relax your grip.</p>

</li>

<li>

<p><strong>Don't Rush</strong>: Make sure you're not drawing faster than you're thinking. Take your time to plan each ellipse.</p>

</li>

<li>

<p><strong>Avoid Cleaning Up Lines</strong>: Don't go back over your drawings to clean up lines or fix mistakes. The goal is to practice drawing the ellipse correctly the first time.</p>

</li>

<li>

<p><strong>Use Your Whole Arm</strong>: Even for small shapes like the eyes, practice using your whole arm instead of just your fingers. This helps improve control and fluidity.</p>

</li>

</ul>

<p>Do these Mario mushroom exercises until you're comfortable with them. If you find them extremely challenging, try doing them every day to build up your muscle memory. If you start getting bored, think of other simple doodles with lots of round shapes that can help you practice ellipses.</p>

<p>Remember, the key is to have fun while improving your skills. So go ahead, fill up a page with Mario mushrooms, post your pages below, and let's get ready to start the line category!</p>
