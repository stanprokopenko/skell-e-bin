<h2>Materials and Tools</h2>

<p>I primarily work with <strong>oils on hardboard</strong>, which I purchase in large sheets and cut down to my preferred size of 16 by 24 inches. The preparation process involves <strong>sanding the hardboard</strong> and applying three coats of diluted gesso, followed by a light sanding before painting.</p>

<p>My palette consists of <strong>Winsor Newton professional-grade paints</strong>, including colors like Titanium White, Cadmium Lemon, and Ultramarine Blue. I often use a limited color range. I'm transitioning to <strong>synthetic brushes</strong> to avoid natural hair brushes, with a preference for Vilbertson flats and synthetic sable brushes. The main brush brands I use are Rosemary, Robert Simmons, and Princeton. I recommend experimenting to find personal preferences.</p>

<p>I use <strong>Gamsol as a thinner</strong> due to its low evaporation rate, which reduces fumes, though it also slows drying time on the board. My painting medium is a mix of <strong>Galkin Lite and Gamsol</strong>, stored in a glass mason jar, to keep it thin and workable. Additional tools include <strong>shop towels for cleaning</strong>, an <strong>aluminum mall stick</strong> to rest my hand while painting, and <strong>carbon transfer paper</strong> for transferring compositions.</p>

<h2>Preparation Process</h2>

<p>To transfer my composition onto the board, I print it out, tape the sheets together, and use carbon transfer paper to trace the image onto the board. I then <strong>seal the transferred drawing</strong> with a workable spray fixative to prevent it from smudging during painting.</p>

<p>I begin painting by applying a <strong>light blue stain</strong> to kill the white of the board, creating a gradient from dark to light. I mix a <strong>base tone</strong> using yellow ochre, transparent maroon, and a bit of orange, starting with thin layers and building up thickness. I prefer a slightly textured surface for painting, achieved by lightly sanding with 300 grit sandpaper.</p>

<h2>Painting Techniques</h2>

<p>I use <strong>Gamsol to thin paints</strong>, similar to water for acrylics, despite some discouragement due to chemical concerns. Mediums can alter drying time, viscosity, and texture, and I use them mainly to speed up drying. I believe the best way to learn painting is through <strong>practice</strong>, rather than relying solely on theoretical knowledge.</p>

<p>Basic <strong>color theory</strong> involves understanding the primary colors and their combinations, with practical experience being crucial. My painting process is <strong>intuitive</strong>, focusing on shape, value, edge, and temperature, similar to drawing techniques. I use a smaller brush for detail work, especially for creating rocky textures, and rely on intuition developed through experience.</p>

<h2>Artistic Approach</h2>

<p>My approach to painting is not to directly copy sketches but to use them as a <strong>guide</strong>, allowing for changes and adjustments. I like to use rocks to create <strong>cross contours</strong>, wrapping them around forms to give the illusion of depth, such as a bent knee. I use slightly darker colors for shadows to create less contrast and a more subtle effect.</p>

<p>I work faster than usual for demonstrations, but a finished piece can take 50 to 60 hours. Building <strong>stamina in art</strong> is like training for a marathon, consistency is key. Start with short drawing sessions, and gradually increase the time to build endurance. Working long hours on art becomes manageable with practice and consistency. Taking breaks and working on multiple projects can prevent burnout. I often work on sketches and thumbnails alongside final paintings, to break up the day. <strong>Consistency and keeping momentum</strong> are crucial skills for professional artists.</p>

<h2>Final Stages and Refinement</h2>

<p>I let paint dry before moving to another area, allowing for better layering and detail. Avoid <strong>over-blending in oil painting</strong> to prevent a mushy appearance, maintain distinct brushstrokes. I use a soft blending technique to subtly merge brushstrokes, without losing their definition. Adding <strong>cool reflected light in shadows</strong> can enhance depth and atmospheric perspective. Re-establishing lost details during painting can add subtlety and depth.</p>

<p>Certain details require the paint to set up before they can be effectively added. <strong>Clean edges and highlights</strong> are challenging to achieve in wet paint and may need a second pass. I often take breaks to let paint set before adding final details. The main challenge is achieving a cohesive big picture before refining details. My painting process involves working wet into wet, then adding crisp details once the paint is tacky.</p>

<h2>Philosophy and Advice</h2>

<p>Initiative and extra effort outside of class can accelerate skill development. Schools may not fully prepare students for the time commitment required to master skills. <strong>Rendering is time-consuming</strong> but straightforward, it's about putting in the effort. Drawing skills are fundamental, and they translate across various mediums and techniques. Painting requires managing the medium, which is more complex than drawing. Understanding shape, value, edge, and temperature is crucial for both drawing and painting. Oil painting involves learning the timing of paint setup and behavior. The final stages of a painting require improvisation and adaptation, as conditions change. The last 20% of a painting takes the most time and effort to refine.</p>
