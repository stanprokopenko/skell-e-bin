<p>I'm Eric Gist. You've probably seen a couple of my lessons so far. We started off with thumbnails and moved on to the finished comp. Now, we're moving on to the final painting.</p>

<h2>Materials</h2>

<p>I usually work in oils on hardboard as my surface. I buy hardboard in big four by eight-foot sheets from the hardware store and cut them down to the size I like, which in this case is 16 by 24 inches. I sand it lightly, clean it off, and apply three coats of diluted gesso to get nice, smooth, even coverage. After a light sanding, it's ready to be painted on within 24 hours.</p>

<h3>Paints</h3>

<p>I've got my paints laid out here, mostly Winsor &amp; Newton professional-grade oils. My palette includes:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Titanium White</strong></li>

<li><strong>Cadmium Lemon</strong></li>

<li><strong>Cadmium Yellow</strong></li>

<li><strong>Yellow Ochre</strong></li>

<li><strong>Cadmium Orange</strong></li>

<li><strong>Burnt Umber</strong></li>

<li><strong>Cadmium Red</strong></li>

<li><strong>Magenta</strong></li>

<li><strong>Transparent Maroon</strong></li>

<li><strong>Dioxazine Violet (Winsor Violet)</strong></li>

<li><strong>Ultramarine Blue</strong></li>

<li><strong>Manganese Blue Hue</strong></li>

<li><strong>Sap Green</strong></li>

<li><strong>Ivory Black</strong></li>

</ul>

<p>I won't be using all these colors for this painting since it's within a limited color range, but I laid out the whole palette so you can see what I typically use.</p>

<h3>Brushes</h3>

<p>My brushes are a mixed bag. I'm switching over to more synthetics because they're kinder to animals. I prefer filberts and flats, and I don't usually use rounds until I get into smaller brushes. For those, I use synthetic sables, which are nylon brushes. The three main brands I use are <strong>Rosemary</strong>, <strong>Robert Simmons</strong>, and <strong>Princeton</strong>. I recommend buying a few, trying them out, figuring out what you like, and then buying more of what you like.</p>

<h3>Thinner and Medium</h3>

<p>For thinner, I use <strong>Gamsol</strong>, a synthetic thinner with a low evaporation rate, so there are fewer fumes in the air while painting. Always try to paint in a ventilated area. The low evaporation rate means it evaporates off your board slower, which isn't always ideal, but everything's a trade-off.</p>

<p>My painting medium is <strong>Galkyd Lite</strong>, which I mix with a little Gamsol to thin it further. I prefer it thin rather than thick and goopy.</p>

<h3>Other Tools</h3>

<p>I use shop towels, which you can get pretty much anywhere these days. I buy them in bulk. I also have an aluminum <strong>mahl stick</strong> to rest my hand on.</p>

<h2>Preparing the Surface</h2>

<p>Once I have my tight comp done, I print it out. If you have a large-format printer, you can print it out on a big sheet. I don't, so I print it on four 8.5 x 11-inch sheets and tape them together to the scale I want.</p>

<p>I enlarge my file to the size of my board, in this case, 16 by 24 inches. Then I print it out, tape it together, and tape it on top of my board. I use <strong>transfer paper</strong> (carbon paper) to transfer the drawing onto the board. I place the carbon side down on the board, put my comp on top, and draw over it to transfer the image.</p>

<p>I usually spray the transferred drawing with a little <strong>workable spray fixative</strong>, sealing it into the surface. Now, I can paint right over the top. I might lose the drawing a little bit, but it usually comes back enough to pick out the major landmarks. My transfer isn't very detailed anyway, I want the big placement as a guideline, not a paint-by-numbers outline.</p>

<h2>Starting the Painting</h2>

<p>One of the first things I like to do is <strong>kill the white</strong> of the board. I don't want the white to throw off my ability to judge value. Since my comp has a fairly pale background, I won't do a heavy stain. Instead, I'll wash in a light blue stain that's darker at the bottom and washes out toward the top, creating the gradient from my comp.</p>

<h3>Laying In the Wash</h3>

<p>I flip the board upside down and use a big brush to apply the wash from top to bottom. I mix some blue paint with Gamsol and a bit of medium, keeping it very thin. This gives me a nice gradient and kills the white of the board.</p>

<h3>Mixing Base Tones</h3>

<p>Next, I mix a base tone using <strong>Yellow Ochre</strong>, <strong>Transparent Maroon</strong>, and a tiny bit of <strong>Cadmium Orange</strong>. I thin it down with medium. I encourage starting thin with your paints and building toward thicker applications. Using the side of my brush, I lay in the stain, getting the surface covered. As I do this, I can still see the drawing through it.</p>

<h3>Continuing the Stain</h3>

<p>I continue staining other areas, using colors like <strong>Magenta</strong> and <strong>Burnt Umber</strong> where appropriate. I'm getting even coverage on the surface. I keep the paint thin, using Gamsol to thin it down as needed. Some people discourage using thinners with oil paints for chemical reasons, but I've never had a problem with it. You will have to varnish your painting later, but most people varnish their oils anyway.</p>

<h3>Understanding Mediums</h3>

<p>Mediums can extend or speed up drying time and can add viscosity, making the paint slicker or thicker, depending on what you use. I mainly use a medium because I want to speed up my drying time more than anything.</p>

<h2>Painting Techniques</h2>

<h3>Starting Thin and Building Up</h3>

<p>I'm starting with a general stain, getting the surface covered. It's always one of the more boring parts to watch, but it's essential. Once the surface is covered, I can start adding thicker paint.</p>

<h3>Using the Right Brushes</h3>

<p>I switch to a smaller brush, as I start adding more opaque paint. I often say that I'm not really a painter, I draw in paint. I don't do anything fancy with it. It's just nice, clean, academic application. I spend my time designing little shapes, brushstrokes, and tiles.</p>

<h3>Breaking Down Shapes</h3>

<p>I go in and break down little rock shapes, trying to follow the anatomy and keep it somewhat randomized. I'm not going too literally off my sketch, I'm continually changing things. I don't directly copy my sketches. I like having them there in case I can't figure something out, or something goes wrong.</p>

<h3>Wrapping Forms</h3>

<p>I take the rocks and wrap them around the form. For example, if a knee is bent and the foot is going away from us, I wrap around the calf to give the illusion that it's passing away from us. Essentially, I'm turning those rocks into little <strong>cross-contours</strong>.</p>

<h3>Controlling the Paint</h3>

<p>Painting is pretty intuitive at this point. Once you've done anything long enough, it starts to happen naturally. I don't really think about every single step, my hand just kind of does it.</p>

<h2>On Color Mixing and Practice</h2>

<h3>Learning by Doing</h3>

<p>I think the best way to learn how to paint is to <strong>paint</strong>. That's always my best recommendation. Some people like doing color charts, but I can't say I learned anything from that that I wouldn't have learned just painting.</p>

<p>The best way to learn to draw is to <strong>draw</strong>. You can read all the books you want, and it's not a bad thing, I've read them all, but you're not going to get good at drawing by just reading. You'll gather information, which will help, but in the end you have to draw to get good at it.</p>

<h3>Understanding Color Theory</h3>

<p>I learned most of what I know about color theory from <strong>Ziploc bags</strong>. When I was a kid, they came out with the yellow and blue make green feature so you could see that it's sealed. That's color theory. You mix yellow and blue, you get green. You mix yellow and red, you get orange. You mix blue and red, you get purple. Beyond that, you can gray it down.</p>

<p>At the core, there are really only <strong>three colors</strong>. Everything else is just a combination of those three. If you're mixing more than three or four paints together, you're <strong>over-mixing</strong>.</p>

<h3>Pigments and Mixing</h3>

<p>Different pigments interact differently together. A transparent pigment will mix differently than an opaque pigment. A warm red will mix differently than a cool red. But trying to describe that is like trying to describe what cold feels like, you just have to experience it. You'll learn the more you do it.</p>

<h2>Building Stamina and Consistency</h2>

<h3>Putting in the Hours</h3>

<p>Usually, to finish a painting like this, we're talking about <strong>50 to 60 hours</strong>. Getting it done or even a semblance of done in just a couple of hours means working at a pretty fast pace.</p>

<h3>Developing Consistency</h3>

<p>It's like training for a marathon. You start off running one mile, then two, then three. Eventually, you're running six miles, and it's not even that tiring. If you stay consistent and work diligently every day, the same thing will happen with art.</p>

<h3>Breaking Up Your Work</h3>

<p>You don't have to be working on one thing. Usually, when I'm working on the final painting of a piece like this, I've got thumbnails going on for a job that's due in a month, and a rough sketch for a painting that's due next week. I break up my day, I'll work on sketches in the morning and thumbnails at night.</p>

<h2>Finalizing the Painting</h2>

<h3>Adding Details and Highlights</h3>

<p>Now, I'm starting to get some thicker paint on there. I'm going in and adding little tiles and brushstrokes, trying not to over-blend. If you've ever worked in oil paint and found everything just turned to mush, it's probably because you're <strong>over-blending</strong>. I prefer to leave the brushstrokes in there as much as possible.</p>

<h3>Adding Reflective Light</h3>

<p>Since the background is a cool blue, I want to add some of that blue reflected light into the shadows. It can help create the illusion that more is going on in those shadows than there actually is.</p>

<h3>Working Wet into Wet</h3>

<p>Most of my painting is wet into wet like this, and then I come in once it's set up, not dry, but tacky, and add really crisp last little details that don't work well wet into wet.</p>

<h3>Knowing When to Stop</h3>

<p>The <strong>big effect</strong> is definitely there. It's got a good feel. It could use probably another three, four, or five hours of refinement, but the effect is there, and that's really the most important thing. Rendering is a lot of sweat equity. If you're willing to put in the time, the finishing touches will come.</p>

<p>I hope you enjoyed that and got something out of it. Learned something about my process and a little about me. I'd like to see what some of you come up with on your own. Post online or on social media, tag me, and I'll take a look. Good luck, everybody, and I look forward to seeing your work.</p>
