<h2>What's in Premium?</h2>

<p>In the premium lesson, you'll learn how to understand and draw space using straight lines. You'll explore how lines correspond to the <strong>X</strong>, <strong>Y</strong>, and <strong>Z</strong> axes—representing width, height, and depth—and how to label and name these lines to reinforce your spatial understanding. The lesson covers how to handle diagonal lines that combine two or three axes, helping you accurately represent depth and orientation in your drawings.</p>

<p>You'll also get practical tips for drawing complex forms by starting with simple shapes and using right angles as references. The lesson explains how to use a <strong>floor plan</strong> or a <strong>wall elevation</strong> as a starting point to establish accurate proportions and perspectives. By combining these foundational elements, you'll learn to build intricate forms and enhance the realism of your sketches, even when drawing freely and loosely.</p>
