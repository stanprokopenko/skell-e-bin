<h2>Embrace Confidence and Agency</h2>

<p>Welcome back! Let's get some magic mileage into your drawing. Continue to fill another page and step into taking the agency you deserve, you are the boss. You know more than you think. You've been drawing all your life, so let's get some confidence into your hand.</p>

<p>When I first entered a studio, my skills skyrocketed just by watching and listening to other artists who knew more than I did. But I also brought something unique to the table. Sometimes, not knowing anything or having no method can be a refreshing take on art. <strong>Whatever you bring, keep it</strong>. If it doesn't work anymore, throw it away and see what you gain from this course.</p>

<p>It's a lot of mileage, a condensed journey of years I've spent learning this stuff. The gift for me is seeing great artists emerge from this workshop. So let's grow together and have fun with it. Draw your head off! Let's go, and good luck!</p>

<h2>Drawing Without Landmarks</h2>

<p>Start thinking about taking agency here. I've included many arrows and indications of landmarks in previous lessons. Now, I want to start removing them and let you place them yourself. I'll indicate the muscles and bones, but <strong>you find them with your eyes and pencil</strong> as you draw along. Get acquainted with the terminology rather than relying on arrows. Think about the <strong>acromion process</strong>, <strong>sternum</strong>, and all the other landmarks we've been learning. I'm sure you already have them in your mind.</p>

<p>You might be thinking, "We don't need all this spoon-fed stuff. We can work it out ourselves." So let's do that.</p>

<h2>Understanding the Iliac Crest</h2>

<p>Think about the egg coming out of the tube, the <strong>iliac crest</strong>. Notice that the body is going away from us at the lower part of the torso, so the iliac crest is a big curved round. Imagine the top of a tub tilted towards you, and you'll start to see why the iliac crest is so important. From the front, it may look like it's high at the back and low at the front, but from the side, it looks like an arc. So when you're drawing the iliac crest, think about that tub lid spinning around to the back.</p>

<p>We're going to get more sophisticated with our drawings.</p>

<h2>Tackling Challenging Facial Angles</h2>

<p>I'm taking the nose off the side of the face here, almost profile but not quite. It's one of the hardest things to do, but it's easier if you're always thinking about halves and working in a system where <strong>everything is aligned</strong>. The eyes align to the bottom of the nose, and the lower lip aligns to all those points. It's only the upper lip and the eyebrows that change their angle.</p>

<p>Think of it as a <strong>fence post</strong> idea every time you draw the eyes, nose, and lower mouth. You can get this pretty good.</p>

<p>I've left out the outside of the face there because it's a big tangent nightmare. That side of the face is tricky because it's not exactly profile. You'll tend to see some of the cheekbone, for instance.</p>

<p>Note that I put in the voice box there, coming in as a V-shape to meet the <strong>sternocleidomastoid</strong>. The sternocleidomastoid isn't visible here, but it's still in our subconscious.</p>

<h2>Understanding Gravity's Effect on the Body</h2>

<p>As the body comes towards us, the proportions are more relaxed. With the body coming forward, <strong>the breasts will start to hang more and become their own shape</strong>. They no longer have such hard edges because they are no longer pressed against the rib cage.</p>

<p><strong>Breasts are the most misunderstood part of the female figure</strong>. They're soft, malleable, subject to gravity, and they're not the same size as each other, even on the same woman. There's always a little difference. <strong>Asymmetry is a dream come true</strong> for artists. Look at the difference in each of these breasts, huge, massive differences. Part of that is because the breast on the outside is going around the corner more.</p>

<h2>Mastering Hands: Common Challenges and Solutions</h2>

<p>Sometimes, you might encounter what I call a <strong>nasty little hand</strong>, like a catcher's mitt where all the fingers are equal. It's a mess of a hand, and you might think, "Why did I use that pose?" See if you can change that little finger to get out of trouble. Try to bend all those fingers in one big swathe of value to show that they are bending, rather than just being long.</p>

<p>It's still adhering to the <strong>1-2-3</strong>, with the longest finger in the middle. There might be some foreshortening to complicate things. That's the hand I avoid like crazy, but I wanted to show you just how problematic that idea is. See if you can vary things as you go.</p>

<h3>Utilizing Tools and References</h3>

<p>I just bought an articulated hand, and I couldn't believe how great the technology has become. I wish I'd had that articulated hand when I was drawing those other two hands. <strong>Stop for a moment, look at it, twist it, and bend it</strong>.</p>

<p>You often hear people say, <strong>never blame your tools</strong>, but you do need to keep your tools well-honed. If I get a pencil straight out of the box, it is practically impossible to draw with. <strong>It has to be sharpened to some point, it has to have a taper</strong>.</p>

<h2>Overcoming Frustration and Taking Breaks</h2>

<p>Every artist is going to have a bad day, and it shouldn't disturb your confidence. <strong>Celebrate your successes and don't fixate on your non-successes</strong>. Learn from everything. Sometimes, you may be fixated on something that's bugging you. Remember, at the end of the day, throw the reference away because the drawing is what matters most.</p>

<p>If something's not working out, <strong>step away</strong>. Take a break. When you come back, you'll often see exactly what's wrong with it because you're not influenced by the reference anymore.</p>

<h2>Embracing Mistakes and Learning Opportunities</h2>

<p>Fear not. This is just part of the process. Constantly draw, and one drawing might work out very well, while the next one might not. But eventually, the mileage will make every drawing easier. There may not even be such a thing as luck, it is born of passion and preparation.</p>

<h2>The Role of Community in Artistic Growth</h2>

<p>I never grew so fast as when I went into a studio and met other artists. That was incredible. I was learning everything at home alone, and then, like a torpedo, my skills grew practically on the first day of meeting other artists and seeing how they work. We all go down the same line of thought and come out with slightly different solutions. The solution they came to might work better than the one you came to, and vice versa.</p>

<p><strong>Surround yourself with like minds. Find your tribe, and grow together</strong>. Even if you're not a professional artist, go to your life-drawing class, and you'll get the same idea. Lots of professional artists go to life-drawing class. It's not something you graduate from and never go back to.</p>

<h2>Emphasizing Asymmetry in Your Work</h2>

<p>I like to think of <strong>asymmetry in everything</strong> - thin lines next to thick lines, even within the shadows. You can see the shadows under the breast are quite light compared to the pinch on the other side of the body, where it's quite heavy. I'm always looking for asymmetry in value, line, and everything. And of course, shapes.</p>

<h2>Incorporating Design and Style into Your Drawings</h2>

<p>When you get foreshortened drawings, <strong>tone really helps to show the distance</strong>. If it's just line, it can look confusing. Thick and thin lines can give us a lot of perspective, but when it comes to a foreshortened pose, tone will do most of the work.</p>

<p>Practice <strong>lost edges</strong>, they're invaluable. Think about stylistic choices. If everything connects, it starts to look like there's no style to it, and everything is like a licorice shape. Sometimes, breaking up lines at junctions can make all the difference.</p>

<h3>Learning from Masters</h3>

<p>Some movie stars are great templates. I often think of <strong>Sophia Loren</strong> as my template for characters, princesses, and queens. Frank Frazetta based his <strong>Conan</strong> on <strong>Jack Palance</strong> and on himself. He liked Italian movie stars, the Italian movie star women were incredible in his time. That's where Sophia Loren came from too.</p>

<p>See what movie stars you like. They're easy to reference, and you might just find a character because they're characteristic to directors that'll suit your needs.</p>

<p>From the olden days, we had <strong>Bravo for Adventure</strong> - Alex Toth's character - who is based mostly on <strong>Errol Flynn</strong>. Errol Flynn is an incredible hero, perfect for that role.</p>

<h3>Observing John Singer Sargent's Techniques</h3>

<p>One of my favorite hands to this very day is <strong>Madame X</strong> by John Singer Sargent. Her hand leaning on a table is just the most beautiful thing. Go see it. You might think, "Wait, that's just simple," and that's actually the whole idea of it. <strong>It was so simple, elegant, and beautiful</strong>.</p>

<h2>Using Pentimento Effectively</h2>

<p>Look at how many rules I'm breaking here, but I'm able to come back into the method again with <strong>pentimento</strong>. I'm laying down light broad lines and shifting them around with my pencil. There's been no erasing here. We're able to keep on drawing without that subconscious nagging that things are wrong because that's what happens when you get an eraser involved.</p>

<p>There's no wrong here, everything is right, even if it needs a little bit of shifting about. The <strong>pentimento</strong> means you can lay down these light broad lines, and adjust them. Even if they get a bit heavy, it still has an energy to it.</p>

<h2>Cultivating the Right Mindset for Artistic Success</h2>

<p>Don't be afraid to let your style evolve. It could be the making of a new style, or a more mature style. <strong>Your style is evolving</strong>. Notice I've filled the page here, what I call a <strong>sketch jam</strong>. So I'm jamming around on this page.</p>

<p>When you get a still pose, see if there's some motion in it that you can bring to a static thing because there always is. Even if the arms are quite wooden, we can put motion into the bones and the muscles.</p>

<p>At the end of the day, throw the reference away because <strong>the drawing is what matters most</strong>. Reference is not your boss.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p>Remember Be fearless with it. Keep drawing, keep learning, and most importantly, <strong>enjoy the process</strong>. You've done all your drawings, this one's just a little bonus. And there is a space for it, so put it in and see what comes of it.</p>
