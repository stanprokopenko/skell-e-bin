<h2>Reflecting on Your Master Analyses</h2>

<p>We're going to spend some time discussing your analyses of master artworks. Seeing such a tremendous response makes me want to say words like <strong>amazing</strong> and <strong>incredible</strong>, and honestly, <strong>I've never seen anything like it</strong>. I thought about recording a loop of me saying those words for every critique, but I prefer responding with live emotional excitement. This is the closest we get to a live hangout with your assignments.</p>

<p>I responded to some of your posts, and I could see that you had fun with the acronym exercises. Vera Robson had a great one, and there was a clever one on YouTube as well. But I think the one that got the greatest response was "What Defaq am I doing?" You win the mnemonic device game! I'm stealing it, and we'll give a great full shot of it. Thank you for playing along.</p>

<p>By the way, Gannon Beck posted worthy observations. Don't miss Gannon's contributions, they are worth your time. We'll take a little time with his Norman Rockwell analysis later.</p>

<h2>Variety in Your Artwork Selections</h2>

<p>Look at what we have here. Guitar mentioned, "It feels weird giving ratings to artists I admire, especially when I'm still very much a beginner. The assignment has definitely helped me develop a critical eye." </p>

<p>These three choices are excellent examples of different perspectives:</p>

<ul>

<li>A normal view of the world with the camera outside of the action. <strong>Convergence</strong> is obvious, <strong>overlap</strong> is obvious, not much <strong>atmosphere</strong>.</li>

<li>A non-normal view, or arguably a more normal view of the world, certainly very different from what Franklin Booth did.</li>

<li>Convergence, diminution, foreshortening, and atmosphere galore, everything is firing at full stops on this one.</li>

</ul>

<p>Even though you only posted three images, you selected three good ones to make the point. You can do 30 or 300 as you go through this. In fact, we've got hundreds here to look at.</p>

<h2>Exploring Peers' Contributions</h2>

<p>Let me scroll through these slowly enough so that, as we're talking, you can see what a smorgasbord of images there are from your peers. Gannon's analysis, for example, covers both forms and values and colors for overlap, we'll dive into that soon.</p>

<p>If you have the time, going through these and learning from what your peers have posted is a good investment of time.</p>

<h2>Individual Feedback and Insights</h2>

<h3>Andres</h3>

<p>A bit off-topic, but Andres shared a picture he's working on for his comic, which has taken about four hours so far. He asked for tips, tricks, or critiques. Andres, you're ahead of the game. If you want to get in sync with what we're doing here, draw it again a few times, freehand.</p>

<h3>Pamela D</h3>

<p>Pamela shared her collection of perspective techniques and rated them all with a five out of five, quite an accomplishment. It's like a playlist of all hits, all the time.</p>

<p>However, one piece might have less convergence than you think. <strong>Convergence</strong> only applies if there are straight lines and if they are parallel to each other. I know there's a little implied convergence because that character could fit into an old-fashioned telephone booth, and we would be looking up at it. But I wouldn't give it a five on convergence.</p>

<h3>Carlos</h3>

<p>Carlos mentioned, "I wanted to do more, but here are some master analyses for the moment. My English is not very good, so sorry if I offended you with my poor prose." You didn't offend at all.</p>

<p>He noticed while searching through his collection that he tends to favor images that are more character-focused, not a lot of environment stuff, and feels that needs to be corrected. Not necessarily. That's up to you. Limiting your focus is okay when it's a choice and you're aware of it, it can actually be good.</p>

<p>Carlos asked, "How would you go about applying the analysis you are making while you are studying? Just doing roughs? Nothing elaborate? Or doing rough sketches with some finished illustration?" </p>

<p>I have a few thoughts about that:</p>

<ol>

<li>If you're advanced enough to create your own finished pictures, just create them and consult the list as you make decisions.</li>

<li>When you look at these masters you admire and say, "I love that thing," try using it in your image. It's a conscious decision to listen to that musician and say, "We can do riffs like that, we can do ideas like that."</li>

<li>Try leaving one out. Escher left out <strong>diminution</strong> in another post by another Carlos, huge diminution, mild diminution, no diminution.</li>

</ol>

<p>Go read what I said to Ethan. Thank you, Carlos.</p>

<h3>Daniela</h3>

<p>Daniela observed, "It is a pleasant experience to notice how much more there is to these pieces than what we just see normally." Yes, you are turning your normal thinking into advanced thinking.</p>

<h3>Sophie P and Amu</h3>

<p>Sophie P, thanks for putting the observations on the slide. It makes it easy when we can read and see at the same time.</p>

<p>Amu wrote, "I'm not sure that I correctly identified all the depth techniques when analyzing the image, but it was cool to notice how much perspective affects even very organic forms indeed."</p>

<p>She had a question about <strong>diminution</strong> and how <strong>convergence</strong> and <strong>foreshortening</strong> seem to stem from it: "It seems to me that diminution causes the space between lines to become smaller, which brings the lines closer together until they meet at a point, convergence."] And then, as a plane tilts away from the camera, it moves away more, which makes the far end smaller, which makes the edges converge more dramatically, which makes the plane appear shorter, foreshortening. Is this understanding correct, or have I got it backward?</p>

<p>I responded that you've got it right, and it makes no difference whether you got it backward or forward. The thing is, you are analyzing this to understand it and bring the different techniques together to see how they affect each other. That's good.</p>

<h3>Ashley's Response</h3>

<p>Ashley writes, "After looking at my library of saved artworks from my favorite artists, I found the most commonly used techniques tend to be <strong>overlap</strong> and <strong>atmosphere</strong>. There doesn't seem to be as much usage of convergent lines in the art I've been looking at, and I think it might be because I generally prefer to look at more organic stuff, which doesn't usually have as many parallel lines as the more technical-looking stuff. <strong>Foreshortening</strong> isn't used as much either, and I think that it's because it's more difficult to get right, but when it is done correctly, it's super good at making your art look more realistic since, in reality, most things won't appear to you in the simple front or side view."</p>

<p>You were drawn to the kind that emphasizes <strong>overlap</strong> and <strong>atmosphere</strong>. There's a reason why some artists avoid foreshortening. The more you foreshorten, the more you run the risk that the audience will not be able to read it quickly. In a lot of storytelling imagery, you want the figure or object to read quickly.</p>

<p>There's another thing, in children's books, <strong>overlap</strong> is obviously the main way that space is created, sometimes <strong>atmosphere</strong>. But as soon as an artist starts using <strong>convergence</strong> and <strong>diminution</strong> and uses it expertly, it makes the picture appear more sophisticated. Sophistication is not the first priority if you're creating pictures for simple minds, like children. As soon as it becomes sophisticated, it starts to say a grown-up did this, an expert did this, which may be what you want.</p>

<p>When you said, "I generally prefer to look at more organic stuff," that work you tend to like has these qualities. That is one of the reasons why we do this, to say, "These elements I will use, these ingredients I will cook with, the other ones, less so." This exercise contributes to your style.</p>

<p>You have wonderful variety in your selections. None of them feels like a run-of-the-mill style, they all feel like the artist has their unique voice. This is a way of reverse-engineering how perspective affects their styles.</p>

<h2>Understanding Through Analysis</h2>

<p>About all this analysis: This past year, Bob Mankoff, who was for many years the editor of the New Yorker cartoons, did a TED talk on whether AI can create a New Yorker cartoon. He brought up the point that in order for AI to create a New Yorker cartoon, the first thing it must do is understand the jokes. Until it can understand the jokes, it's unlikely that it's going to come up with a good cartoon unless it was by accident.</p>

<p>That's what we're doing here. You are looking at these pieces to understand them. It is still theory, but it is extracting theory to try to make it practical for your work.</p>

<h2>Espy's In-Depth Analysis</h2>

<p>Espy, you were one of the three or four who posted an entire course for us, and it comes out of what the secret of mastery is, that you love doing this and that you notice that some techniques are emphasized more than others.</p>

<p>You've given an analysis for each one of these factors, and this separating into colors to simplify shapes, this separating into colors to accentuate <strong>overlap</strong>, also gives you a secret way to study composition. It's as if you've discovered your own Kirlian photography to see the picture's aura.</p>

<p>These are great ways to understand your picture. Thank you for all these posts, Espy, a little mini-course of this lesson.</p>

<h2>Additional Observations</h2>

<h3>Johannes</h3>

<p>Johannes shared a fun fact about the sun and the moon: they only cover half a degree or 30 arc minutes of our vision. So if you take a punched piece of paper and hold it at an arm's length, the full moon is going to fit right inside that little hole. Don't look directly into the sun, please.</p>

<h3>Gannon Beck's Norman Rockwell Analysis</h3>

<p>Let's look at Gannon Beck's analysis. There's so many good slides here. If you are involved in your own little in-person community where you spend an hour or three going through these on your own with your friends, Gannon posted a Norman Rockwell piece with comments.</p>

<p><strong>Shuffleton's Barbershop</strong> by Norman Rockwell is a painting that is many people's favorite, approaching perfection in both concept and execution. While I could go on all day about what I think this painting is saying about the importance of art, and in this case, music, and the human experience, I'm going to get on with the analysis.</p>

<h4>Form Analysis</h4>

<p><strong>Convergence: 5 out of 5</strong></p>

<p>This painting is set up on a one-point perspective grid. Rockwell placed objects throughout the painting to reinforce the grid, from the magazine rack on the left, the rugs on the floor, and the boards on both the ceiling and the floor. Interestingly, he didn't place the vanishing point at the center of interest, he placed it inside the part of the room we don't see. It creates a bit of mystery. Are there other musicians in the room? Are they playing for somebody? We're left to wonder.</p>

<p>The forms within the shapes all overlap in accordance with the perspective established, and the same goes for the foreshortening.</p>

<h4>Value Analysis</h4>

<p>The value design of this is <strong>brilliant</strong>. The light and the shadow are distinctly organized. Look at Rockwell's book <em>Rockwell on Rockwell: How I Make a Picture</em>, and he talks about how much work he puts into planning his value arrangements. It goes beyond perspective, but yes, good observation.</p>

<p>The focal point of the musicians is far from the viewer, and Rockwell avoided the darkest values in this area to help push the figures to the back, that's <strong>atmosphere</strong>. He's making it so that there's some thickness to that space with the particles in the air, even though it's rendered small.</p>

<p>Compared to the size of the painting, we are drawn to the figures in the light. They are like jewels against a whole bunch of stuff that is not as valuable.</p>

<h4>Shape Analysis</h4>

<p><strong>Overlapping: 5 out of 5</strong></p>

<p>Rockwell gives us lots of things to look at, the barber's tools, the chairs, the benches, the stove heater, the bucket, the rifle and fishing gear on the shelves, the comic books on the magazine rack, the poster on the wall. Just as there are layers to the painting, Rockwell is making the point that there are layers to this barber. He's an outdoorsman, he is considerate to children, he is patriotic, and he is a musician that likes to make music with his friends after hours.</p>

<p>The framing of the musicians within the doorframe is an inspired choice. He could have filled up the canvas with the figures, as he has in other paintings, but he didn't do that here. Just as the room is the inner sanctum of this shop, we get the sense that music is the inner sanctum of these musicians.</p>

<p>Moreover, Rockwell made the additional choice to show the windowpane. He could have chosen not to do this. This makes the viewer seem a bit voyeuristic. Perhaps the viewer was running an errand on a cold night, we know it's cold because the heater is glowing. Whatever the reason, the viewer was walking by the barbershop, came across a mini concert, and took it in, enjoying music that perhaps wasn't being made for him or her but was found all the same. And though this may be the inner sanctum of this barber, he left the door open.</p>

<p>A lot more can be said about this, but I digress.</p>

<h4>Additional Thoughts on Values</h4>

<p>There have been a number of things here, but I want to mention another thing about the values. <strong>Dark values</strong> mean something in a <strong>light</strong> environment. <strong>Light values</strong> mean something in a <strong>dark</strong> environment. You can say that the dark background brings out the light foreground. In this case, he worked the opposite of that. He has mainly darker foreground, and then it is the background that becomes light.</p>

<p>It's as if when you're shining a spotlight on a stage, don't shine it on the stage during the day. N.C. Wyeth did a similar thing like this in one of his <em>Treasure Island</em> illustrations, where the treasure is seen because there is a figure in the foreground who is in such shadow that it accentuates the light and the treasure.</p>

<p>We are moving into compositional studies, that is where we're headed in the next year or three. As you master perspective, you are mastering a technical discipline, and where you go with any technical discipline is to use it creatively. Rockwell is using this creatively.</p>

<h4>Diminution</h4>

<p>The figures are about the same size as the comics on the magazine rack. Although the figures are the focal point of the painting, they are painted quite small. Rockwell gives us lots of things we are familiar with for size comparisons and to just look at.</p>

<p>No more to say until now, good observations, Gannon.</p>

<p>Another one of you pointed out how having a large object in the foreground gets us into the action. And yes, he could have left out the pane, but that tells us we could reach out and touch it, and we can go all the way through that space.</p>

<p>Excellent observations, Gannon. For the rest of you, look at everything else he posted. I think you'll get a lot out of it.</p>

<h3>Danny's Question on Atmosphere</h3>

<p>Danny asked for help: "I underperformed on the original gathering assignment, so I gathered some more for this one. I'm not sure I understand <strong>atmosphere</strong>. Is it when air and space is represented and implied with the horizon?"</p>

<p>Let me tell you this: It is not dependent on the horizon. It can happen in a steam room or in a walk-in freezer within just a few steps.</p>

<p>At its simplest, <strong>atmosphere</strong> is the amount of fog, or at least the practical effect of it. Let me elaborate. <strong>Atmospheric perspective</strong> has three specific components, and they all start with the letter <strong>C</strong>.</p>

<ol>

<li>

<p><strong>Contrast</strong>: If you've got a light background and you have a dark thing, and you move back far enough, that darker thing will fade into the background. The same thing happens in the opposite. If the background and the thing in the foreground are different enough in contrast, it will create that illusion of thickness.</p>

</li>

<li>

<p><strong>Color Changes</strong>: When you have green mountains with green trees on them, and you get far enough back from them, they don't look green anymore, they look lavender. The same thing will happen with a mountain of yellow dirt. It's not about the thing changing color, it's about what happens in the air between.</p>

</li>

<li>

<p><strong>Clarity of Detail</strong>: You can see the blades of grass that are right there near your feet, but you cannot see the blades of grass that are on the other side of the yard.</p>

</li>

</ol>

<p>Now, back to Danny's posts. I don't see any difference in the contrast or color saturation from the front to the back. This is an example where you are using perspective and then choosing to leave one of them out.</p>

<p>Sometimes, when there's a fog, a spotlight cuts right through it, that's an exception. But look at how high contrast Hergé, in this <em>Tintin</em> image, made the background. That is a choice. It changes the tone of a picture. It makes it so that instead of having everything fade back, you decide to emphasize shape. But there is also no detail. So, they did not fade back for contrast, they did fade back for the amount of detail we can see in them.</p>

<p>I think there's an analogy in music. Some recording engineers and producers hate reverb on a singer's voice, just let the singer be how they sound. Folk music likes that kind of thing. But then there's another kind of music, where you want that kind of effect. This background is so high contrast and so assertive, it has qualities similar to what heavy metal did. You don't have syrupy backgrounds that connect it all together. You have assertive shapes, assertive sounds that pop out and create a rhythm.</p>

<p>Thank you for your question that led us into more components.</p>

<h3>Gyorgy's Observations</h3>

<p>Gyorgy noted, "As I can see, most environment concept artists use all the weapons available, but I found out that it's mostly atmospheric perspective that was used the most."</p>

<p>There are some people who hate atmospheric perspective. I've heard more than one person in the game industry say, "If I see another portfolio piece that relies on atmospheric perspective..." Because, as cinematographer Néstor Almendros said in <em>Visions of Light</em>, it's too easy. Actually, he was referring to fog filters.</p>

<p>But <strong>atmosphere</strong> is useful. If you want to see a great example of it, the Coen brothers' movie <em>True Grit</em> has a courtroom scene in which there's a thick atmosphere. There's a reason why filmmakers and artists want to exploit the fact that air, when there's enough of it, is not invisible. You can see these images are putting that to use.</p>

<h2>Lucy's Exercise and Observations</h2>

<p>Lucy used this exercise as an excuse to dig through favorite art books once more. In Rembrandt's <strong>The Anatomy Lesson</strong>, we can see that he chose to show the illusion of depth by using extreme <strong>foreshortening</strong> and also virtually no <strong>diminution</strong>, which you noted here. This effect of being a hundred steps away and yet zoomed in so that it fills the frame creates an odd look that is not how we normally see the world.</p>

<p>I'm not a big fan of binoculars because I find that when I try to use them, the weird shape that it forces into, the binoculars I was familiar with were these ones that my dad let us inherit from his World War II experience. They weigh too much and they're hard to use, but they are incredible for how, when you look through them, you see the world differently.</p>

<p>We looked through these to see Los Angeles from the 34th story of an apartment building this past week, and it is so surreal. You don't see the world like that. That is a creative use of what long lenses do to the view. We are going to take this up deeply around lessons group 11 and 12. Look at how the foot doesn't get bigger in this image as it gets closer.</p>

<p>Compare that with the opposite extreme of what Donna posted, close to far.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p>I hope you've learned from this. The last we'll look at is this collection of John's, six pieces of art from my favorite artists on Instagram, in order. These things we've talked about, in their varying elements, show great variety. Even if some of them didn't quite pull it off, this is what I hope you will stretch for.</p>

<p>This project was to make the spectrum of perspective, I hope it did that.</p>

<p>We are going to move on from this context of what people use to create the illusion to some specific disciplines, including orthographic views, where you look at things from only straight-on views. Then we're going to try to tip them into perspective. We're going to do it by eyeball and then by measuring things specifically, that's coming up.</p>

<p>I hope you see that the simple lesson was to understand what the tricks are. The advanced lesson is that these techniques affect <strong>feeling</strong>. That's for later. First, we learn their names and their components.</p>

<p>You did a good job. Thank you. See you again soon.</p>
