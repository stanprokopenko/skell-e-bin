<h2>Starting with a Simple Scene</h2>

<p>I began with a simple geometric composition of a mountainscape, divided into three layers:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Foreground</strong>: A hill with a character walking along a path.</li>

<li><strong>Midground</strong>: A castle structure.</li>

<li><strong>Background</strong>: Mountains fading into the distance.</li>

</ul>

<p>This setup allows me to explore depth and layering compositionally.</p>

<h2>Establishing Ambient Light</h2>

<p>I like to start by considering <strong>ambient light</strong>. In this case, I imagined a bluish, cloudy daylight coming from all directions. I began painting very roughly, gradually refining without relying on the line art, aiming for believable lighting and color.</p>

<h2>Adding Ambient Occlusion and Local Color</h2>

<p>I split the scene into distinct layers, sky, mountains, midground, and foreground, using selections to keep elements separate. Then, I created an <strong>ambient occlusion</strong> pass, painting in the soft shadows to give form. At this stage, I kept everything gray to focus on lighting rather than local color.</p>

<p>Next, I introduced <strong>local color</strong> to the elements:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Grass</strong> for the hills.</li>

<li><strong>Stone</strong> for the castle walls.</li>

<li><strong>Snow</strong> on the distant mountains.</li>

</ul>

<p>This provided a starting point to explore various lighting scenarios.</p>

<h2>Exploring Different Lighting Scenarios</h2>

<h3>Misty Morning</h3>

<p>I adjusted the sky to a grayer tone with soft clouds and added layers of fog and mist to create depth and separation. By desaturating the colors, the scene became muted and misty. Adding small lights to the castle drew the eye, making it a focal point.</p>

<h3>Dense Fog</h3>

<p>To create a scene enveloped in dense fog, I lightened and slightly blurred the background mountains, simulating atmospheric diffusion. Additional fog layers further separated the elements, and the character in the foreground became the main focal point due to the high contrast.</p>

<h3>High-Key Morning Light</h3>

<p>Using a morning sunrise as reference, I repainted the sky with soft blues and oranges. Light came from screen left, wrapping around objects with soft shadows. Soft pastel colors and a glow layer created a bright, happy morning atmosphere.</p>

<h3>Midday with a Pool of Light</h3>

<p>I introduced clouds to allow a <strong>beam of light</strong> to shine solely on the castle. The surrounding areas remained in shadow, emphasizing the castle as the focal point. Fog layers enhanced separation, and subtle color adjustments focused attention on the lit area.</p>

<h3>Midday Sun</h3>

<p>With sunlight coming from screen right, I painted direct light and shadows accordingly. Adding <strong>cyan highlights</strong> helped define shape and form, especially on rounded surfaces. A subtle glow softened contrasts, creating an inviting daytime scene.</p>

<h3>Sunset</h3>

<p>I darkened the overall image and shifted colors towards purples to depict a sunset. Adding a sun with glow layers and painting highlights onto surfaces captured the warm evening light. Window lights added contrast, enhancing the mood.</p>

<h3>Nighttime</h3>

<p>For a nighttime scene, I darkened the image and painted in dark clouds. Fog layers created depth, and window lights with glow effects brought life to the castle. Adding a moon and stars, along with <strong>rim lighting</strong> from the moonlight, emphasized shapes and added a magical quality.</p>

<h2>Reflecting on the Variations</h2>

<p>Comparing these versions side by side highlights how <strong>lighting and color dramatically affect mood and focus</strong>. Whether it's the mystery of dense fog or the warmth of a sunrise, each lighting scenario transforms the same composition into a distinctly different experience.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p>This process illustrates how starting with a simple line drawing and thoughtfully applying lighting and color can explore a range of emotions and visual narratives. By considering how light interacts with the environment, we can manipulate composition, depth, and mood to create compelling concept designs.</p>
