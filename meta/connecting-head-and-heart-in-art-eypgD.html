<h2>Welcome to the Program</h2>

<p>I'm thrilled to have you join this journey. My approach to art is particularly romantic and holistic. I believe in engaging both <strong>head and heart</strong>, <strong>craft and creativity</strong>, <strong>skill sets and mindset</strong>. Together, we'll explore tools that can help you level up more quickly and with less stress. As you build your skills, you'll begin to find your own creative voice.</p>

<h2>A Holistic Approach to Art</h2>

<p>I'll provide foundational tools that underlie the craft skills, the how-to models, the engineering, and the science-like laws of light, anatomy, linear perspective, and more. While I love that "sciencey" stuff, I don't mistake it for being art. They're tools for creating great art, but art itself is something more.</p>

<p>I aim to train your <strong>aesthetic and creative senses</strong> and look at all that craft in a simpler, more childlike, intuitive way. By gaining control of these elements more quickly and being less overwhelmed by them, good things can happen.</p>

<h2>Why Art?</h2>

<p>Think about our social systems, our tribes, villages, cities, nations, and our planet. We came together in groups because it was safer, we were afraid. While this has worked well, these systems are often based on fear and promote doom and gloom. We're rewarded and punished, worrying inside our heads, feeling separate from an outside world that is dangerous to us.</p>

<p>Yet, as much as we're rational beings, most of our choices are on the unconscious level, on the <strong>heart-centered level</strong>, working out of emotion. <strong>That's why art matters</strong>, because art deals with heart-centered truths. It's where meaning and purpose reside, where motivation is found, and where living the good life exists.</p>

<h2>Art as a Heart-Centered Practice</h2>

<p>Art is intertwined with every art form on the planet and in every spiritual tradition. Both are <strong>heart-centered strategies</strong>, <strong>purpose-driven strategies</strong>, making them powerful wisdom traditions. If we approach art as not just a craft, not just a career, but something much greater than that, we have a way through.</p>

<p>By starting from that heart-centered, intuitive, almost childlike base, we can level up more quickly. We'll learn the skill of drawing the figure, but we'll also learn other skills, a bit of mindset, a bit about simplifying overwhelming tasks like drawing a likeness in graphite or oil paint.</p>

<p>Learning to <strong>simplify</strong>, to "chunk down," will give us more control and more creative freedom. We'll combine craft and creativity, so we can get very good at our skills while expressing our own unique voice. This way, we can stand out from the crowd, and work from our own authentic truth.</p>

<h2>Art as a Set of Beautiful Ideas</h2>

<p>We're making art much bigger than we've been told it really is because it <strong>is</strong> much bigger. Art is really a set of beautiful personal and collective ideas. If we can get control of those ideas, then all things are possible.</p>

<h2>Artists as Visual Philosophers</h2>

<p>I think of artists, when they become in touch with their own personal style, as <strong>visual philosophers</strong>. Rembrandt saw the world in a certain way, and he had to paint that way. KÃ¤the Kollwitz saw the world in a very specific way, and she had to draw that way. Their style came out naturally, not from techniques they stumbled on from some old master, but from their own authentic selves.</p>

<p>We love these artists not just because of their craft skills. We remember the <strong>stylists</strong>, the ones who had a unique vision, the ones who showed us how to see the world in a way we couldn't have possibly seen without their help. <strong>That's what art is designed to do.</strong></p>

<h2>Born to Create</h2>

<p>Every soul on this planet is born into this world with a deep need to survive, and yet we're also born to <strong>create</strong>. Based on brain science alone, the human race is a race of artists, we are creative dynamos. For better or worse, we've reshaped this planet, and we can reshape ourselves. We've remade the world not by tooth and claw, but by sheer creative genius.</p>

<p>Yet, we don't have an education system or many social support systems that help artists become their best possible selves. We can do better.</p>

<h2>The Trauma of Disconnection and the Healing of Connection</h2>

<p>We come into this world disconnected, the cord is cut. We learn the hard, often traumatic lesson of separation, and on some level, we spend the rest of our lives trying to <strong>connect</strong>. To our family, later to our friends that are chosen instead of our biological family, we seek out community. We look for our soulmate, someone to complete us, to connect to so we're safer and more than we were before.</p>

<p>That's what art is designed to do. Spiritual traditions and art traditions, at their highest level, deal with the trauma of <strong>disconnection</strong> and the healing power of finding <strong>connection</strong>. That makes them potentially healing and certainly kind of fun.</p>

<p>Think about it, you and I get to spend most of our waking day <strong>looking for beauty</strong>. How amazing is that? Most people are worried about stress, they don't have time to hear the birds sing or to look at the beautiful light illuminating the barista as they hand over your coffee and bagel. We get to look for beauty and develop an art practice that captures it on the page, potentially sharing it with our fellow citizens. That's a pretty good deal.</p>

<h2>Art as a Connective Strategy</h2>

<p>Here's the truth in each of our lives: we come from a more perfect place where all of our needs were met. We come into this world, and the cord is cut. We learn that we're separate from the world. We feel <strong>cut off</strong>, <strong>disconnected</strong>, and on some level, we spend the rest of our lives trying to connect.</p>

<p>When we think of all the craft skills we want to learn, think of them as <strong>connective strategies</strong>. How do we connect light to shadow? How do we connect foreground to background, warm colors to cool, line to tone, abstract paint strokes to realist aesthetics? Every craft choice we're working with is, on an intuitive, heart-centered level, a connective strategy.</p>

<p>If we begin there, not with laws of light and learning all the muscle forms and vanishing points, but thinking of it simply, it's easier, less stressful, and more effective.</p>

<h2>The Power of Art to Heal</h2>

<p>Art is designed to show us how exquisite life can be, how loving it can be. Art can help us dream of living a more heroic life, help us work through the trauma of life, finding the connections, however thin or ephemeral they might be.</p>

<p>Because most of the time, we don't feel that. We feel cut off, disconnected. Art and spiritual traditions can deal with that. They have some role in healing that. <strong>Art heals</strong>.</p>

<p>Art is used in child trauma therapy, in PTSD trauma, in prison reform, in blighted communities. If you have an art practice, you have a spiritual practice. You're generally a happier human being than average. You feel more connected, more optimistic, you're healthier, you live longer, and you're a better citizen. It does a tremendous amount of good, and yet we're not teaching our artists how to do any of those things.</p>

<h2>The Journey Ahead</h2>

<p>That's the project we're beginning here. In the next lesson, I'll take you through some of the specific goals and strategies, and then we'll move on through the course. I'm going to teach you some ideas, not just about the craft but what the best in the world are doing in disciplines other than art, to become the best in the world.</p>

<p>We'll take some of those emotional strategies, those <strong>connective strategies</strong>, those emotional truths, and build that into your art practice as you design a well-constructed figure in a well-constructed environment.</p>

<p>Lots to do, lots of promises made. I'll do my best to fulfill them. I'll see you in the next lesson, and we'll begin our journey.</p>
