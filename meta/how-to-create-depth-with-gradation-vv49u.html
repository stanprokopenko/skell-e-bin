<h2>The Beginning of Shadows</h2>

<p>I start by thinking of <strong>two sides of the form</strong>: the light side and the shadow side. I draw the <strong>shape of the shadow</strong> on the form, then give the <strong>beginning of that shadow a soft edge</strong>. That soft edge is like a <strong>microgradation</strong>. Even with a small transition, I begin to <strong>suggest volume</strong>. If I decide to <strong>deepen</strong> that microgradation, it becomes a <strong>fuller gradation</strong>, which rounds the form more.</p>

<p>On complex figures, I might connect multiple shapes, but the <strong>audience only notices</strong> if I complete the idea of softening or sharpening the edges. The result is a clear sense of which shapes are fully rendered and which forms are still in progress.</p>

<h2>Cast Shadows vs. Form Shadows</h2>

<p>A <strong>cast shadow</strong> appears where one form blocks light from falling on another surface. When I see a shadow on the tabletop or on another part of the figure, I recognize it as a cast shadow. Meanwhile, a <strong>form shadow</strong> (or “core shadow”) is where the light <strong>naturally turns</strong> on the form itself. The start of that shadow is a <strong>soft edge</strong> that marks where the form begins to <strong>transition from light to dark</strong>.</p>

<p>Sometimes, the <strong>edge of a cast shadow</strong> can be <strong>softened</strong> (like if a lamp’s bulb creates a soft glow), but I usually keep it from becoming a full gradation because that would <strong>round</strong> what’s supposed to be a sharp boundary.</p>

<h2>Rounding the Form with Gradation</h2>

<p>Gradation isn’t just about value, it can also include <strong>color</strong> and <strong>temperature</strong> for those who paint. But the main idea is the same, <strong>more gradation</strong> means <strong>rounder forms</strong>, and <strong>less gradation</strong> suggests <strong>boxy planes</strong>.</p>

<p>I keep in mind that <strong>lights stay light</strong> and <strong>darks stay dark</strong>. If I add a lot of darker halftones in the light side, then I need to <strong>squint</strong> and confirm the shadow side remains clearly darker. This helps <strong>separate</strong> the form into distinct light and dark families.</p>

<p>I often <strong>blend</strong> the shadow into a dark background if they’re the same value. That’s something <strong>painters from the Brown School</strong>, like Rembrandt, did often. The form can <strong>drop off</strong> into darkness, which adds drama without losing clarity.</p>

<h2>Value Separation and the Squint Test</h2>

<p>I rely on a simple rule: the <strong>light side</strong> should be a <strong>range of light values</strong>, and the <strong>shadow side</strong> should be a <strong>range of dark values</strong>. Sometimes I leave the <strong>darkest halftone</strong> close to the shadow’s value, but I keep an overall separation so my shapes remain clear. I <strong>squint</strong> to check if the shadows are still distinctly darker than the lights.</p>

<h2>Demonstrating on a Figure</h2>

<p>When I draw a figure, I use <strong>basic shapes</strong> like eggs and tubes to block in the torso, rib cage, and limbs. Once I have those shapes, I <strong>fill in the shadow</strong> areas and add <strong>halftones</strong> to create a <strong>soft, continuous transition</strong> from light to shadow,</p>

<p>• First, I sketch the <strong>big shadow shapes</strong>.<br />

• Then, I mark the <strong>core shadow</strong> with a <strong>soft edge</strong>.<br />

• Next, I refine that edge with a <strong>gradual transition</strong> into halftones.<br />

• If the form is large, I let the <strong>shadow merge with the background</strong> if those values match.  </p>

<p>By doing this, I can <strong>pinch or wobble the shape</strong> to show subtle anatomy. If I’m unsure about certain details, I can let the form’s outline <strong>blend back</strong> into the bigger shape. I’ll keep the shadow mostly intact, so viewers sense the structure, even if I simplify smaller forms.</p>

<h2>Iterating and Refining</h2>

<p>As I build up halftones, I might notice I need to <strong>darken</strong> my overall shadows. That can lead me to <strong>push</strong> the background even darker, so I don’t lose my separation between light and dark. I keep <strong>revisiting</strong> each area, like the chest, rib cage, or abdomen, and add or soften halftones until I get the effect I want.</p>

<p><strong>Gradation</strong> is powerful because I can place it anywhere: following an egg shape in the torso, <strong>dropping light</strong> off a shoulder into the upper arm, or <strong>fading</strong> an arm into the background. The more I do it, the more I see new ways to let the form disappear, pop out, or stay subtle.</p>

<p>I find this approach <strong>simple yet challenging</strong>. The ideas are straightforward, soft transitions, value separation, shaping the shadow, but applying them takes practice. By breaking each form into clear, basic shapes and then <strong>iterating with small gradations</strong>, I gradually build up to a believable figure.</p>

<p>I encourage you to <strong>experiment</strong> with these concepts. Create that <strong>soft edge</strong> at the core shadow, push it until you get a <strong>fuller gradation</strong>, and watch your forms <strong>round out</strong>. Stick to the rule of keeping <strong>lights and darks</strong> separate, and you’ll see your figures take on a <strong>dynamic, three-dimensional quality</strong>.</p>
