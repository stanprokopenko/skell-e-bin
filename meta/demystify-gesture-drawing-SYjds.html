<p>In this gesture course, I'm focused on approaching gesture in a way that you can find accessible. The emphasis is on <strong>organizing your thoughts</strong> and making gesture something that doesn't have to be mysterious or ambiguous.</p>

<h2>The Approach to Gesture</h2>

<p>I'm providing some structure and steps, but also keeping it open enough for you to approach it from different styles. More than anything, I want you to understand <strong>why you're doing it</strong>. Sometimes it's really hard to even know <strong>what gesture is</strong>, <strong>why you should use it</strong>, what role it might have in your drawing, or even if it's a drawing in and of itself.</p>

<h2>Building a Framework</h2>

<p>I've put a lot of emphasis on helping you <strong>build a framework</strong>. It's important to think about the subject of study before we jump into the technical side of things. I want you to consider what gesture means in your work and how it fits into your artistic process.</p>

<h2>What You Will Learn</h2>

<p>In this course, you're going to learn:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>How to pose your figures</strong></li>

<li><strong>Thinking about the internal dynamics of your figures</strong></li>

<li><strong>Understanding proportion</strong></li>

<li><strong>Concepts of design</strong></li>

<li>How to adjust your figures based on what you want to prioritize in the final result</li>

</ul>

<p>By the end of this course, you should come away with a couple of different approaches to think about gesture. I hope you'll have a broad enough understanding of the subject to make your own innovations on it.</p>

<h2>Encouraging Personal Style</h2>

<p>I don't want you to draw exactly like me. I want you to draw in your own style but take from this course the components that might help you make that style the clearest and most communicative it can be for the stories you create with your figures.</p>
