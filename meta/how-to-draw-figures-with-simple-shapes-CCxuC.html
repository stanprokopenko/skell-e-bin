<p>Welcome to "The Power of Osmosis" Part One: <strong>Shapes and Rhythms</strong>. In this lesson, you'll explore a simple way to build a standing figure. You'll learn to turn it in space, view it from all angles, and draw using methods of interlocking shapes and flowing gestures.</p>

<p>Every time you pause during drawing, it's a moment of thought. <strong>Never rush your drawing.</strong> Allow yourself to think and process as you go. The fundamentals are always worth revisiting, and the main thing is to <strong>enjoy the process</strong>.</p>

<p>Let's dive into these shapes and rhythms. You'll draw them many times, from different angles, and with plenty of fun. By doing this, you'll look forward to every turn and change in the form. The figure will no longer be daunting because you'll have these forms in mind. No matter how the form turns, you'll be able to turn your pencil with it and understand those shapes.</p>

<p>These shapes are, of course, anatomy. But we'll turn them into mnemonic memory clues that you'll never forget. Through this lesson, you'll distill years of knowledge into your own understanding. By the end of this course, <strong>you'll be a better artist</strong>. So, let's get into it. Get your pencils or charcoal out, and let's get drawing!</p>

<h2>Drawing Without Fear</h2>

<p>When starting a drawing class, you might feel shy or think you can't draw as well as others. To alleviate that fear, start with <strong>blind contour drawing</strong>. This means you don't look at the page while drawing. Instead, you move your hand around the page with your pencil while looking at the subject.</p>

<p>You'll create wonderful, unexpected drawings. It's proof that what's inherent in you is beautiful. Sometimes, the mechanics of drawing can curtail creativity. But by drawing without looking, you let go of rigid methods and let the beauty inside you dominate the drawing.</p>

<p><strong>Drawings are beautiful when they have life</strong> - the dark and light of the pencil, the broad edge, the thin lines, and variations. It's a lot to consider as you draw, but the more you draw, the more it becomes a natural reaction.</p>

<h3>Blind Contour Drawing</h3>

<p>Try blind contour drawing with friends. As you look at the subject, move your pencil without looking at the page. Explore the weight of your pencil. When you get to areas like the eyebrows, drop the pencil on its broad side to feel the heaviness. But remember, <strong>never press too hard</strong>.</p>

<p>A helpful tip is to reduce the pressure you're applying to the pencil by half. Automatically, your drawings will improve. Always keep in mind:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Long, light, and loose</strong>: These are your first lines.</li>

<li><strong>Big to small</strong>: Start with big shapes, then move to smaller details.</li>

<li><strong>What's on the other side?</strong>: Always consider the opposite side of what you're drawing.</li>

</ul>

<p>By keeping these in mind, every drawing will have rhythm and method, without rigidity. Think of it as singing your heart out without words, just beautiful songs created with shapes and tone.</p>

<h2>Shapes and Mnemonics</h2>

<p>There is a method to drawing figures using simple shapes and mnemonic devices. Think in <strong>halves and quarters</strong>:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Halfway down the body</strong> is the <strong>great trochanter</strong> (hip bone).</li>

<li><strong>Quarters</strong> can be marked at the knees and hips.</li>

<li>On an eight-head-tall model, key landmarks are:<ul>

<li><strong>Head</strong></li>

<li><strong>Nipples</strong></li>

<li><strong>Navel</strong></li>

<li><strong>Crotch</strong></li>

</ul>

</li>

</ul>

<p>These points divide the body into proportions that are easy to remember.</p>

<h3>The Egg and Liberty Bell</h3>

<p>For the torso, think of two main shapes:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>The Egg</strong>: Represents the rib cage.</li>

<li><strong>The Liberty Bell</strong>: Represents the hips.</li>

</ul>

<p>These are mnemonic ideas, strange memory clues that help you remember anatomy. They provide a <strong>ballpark</strong> to work within. By having these shapes in mind, you can design the figure, rather than just copy it.</p>

<h3>Additional Mnemonics</h3>

<ul>

<li><strong>Mrs. V</strong>: Refers to the crotch area.</li>

<li><strong>Mr. T</strong>: Represents the shoulders and clavicles.</li>

<li><strong>Sartorius Muscle</strong>: Think of it as a gesture line, the longest muscle, adding flow to your drawings.</li>

<li><strong>Knees</strong>: Imagine an <strong>ice cream cone</strong>. The scoop is the kneecap, the cone is the leg below.</li>

</ul>

<p>These mnemonics make complex anatomy more approachable and memorable.</p>

<h2>Proportions and Measurements</h2>

<p>Understanding proportions is key to drawing the figure accurately. Use simple divisions:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Halves</strong>: Divide the body into two equal parts at the hip bone.</li>

<li><strong>Quarters</strong>: Mark at the knees and other key points.</li>

<li><strong>Thirds</strong>: From the crotch to the tenth rib, up to the shoulders, and then to the head.</li>

</ul>

<p>Think of these divisions not as rigid rules but as <strong>ballparks</strong> to work within. They help you make adjustments as needed.</p>

<h3>The Head and Neck</h3>

<ul>

<li>The <strong>eyes</strong> are in the <strong>center of the head</strong>.</li>

<li>From the <strong>nose to the neck</strong> is the same distance as from the <strong>nose to the top of the head</strong>.</li>

<li>This measurement helps you determine the length of the neck.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Arms and Hands</h3>

<ul>

<li>The <strong>crook of the arm</strong> can be found by swinging up from the navel in an arc.</li>

<li>The <strong>wrists</strong> align when swinging up from the crotch.</li>

<li>Women's arms are generally shorter than men's.</li>

<li>The length from the <strong>wrist to the middle knuckle</strong> is half the length down to the longest finger.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Gesture vs. Structure</h2>

<p>Drawing figures isn't just about structure, it's about capturing the <strong>gesture</strong> and <strong>flow</strong>.</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Gesture</strong>: The movement and flow of the figure.</li>

<li><strong>Structure</strong>: The underlying framework and anatomy.</li>

</ul>

<p>Combine both to create dynamic and lively drawings.</p>

<h3>Asymmetry and Contrapposto</h3>

<p>Asymmetry adds beauty to your drawings. In a <strong>contrapposto</strong> pose (counterbalance):</p>

<ul>

<li>The <strong>weight-bearing leg</strong> is straight, causing the shoulders to tilt.</li>

<li>One side of the body <strong>pinches</strong> (shortens), the other <strong>stretches</strong> (lengthens).</li>

<li>The <strong>relaxed leg</strong> bends, causing shifts in the hips and gluteal muscles.</li>

</ul>

<p>Understanding these shifts helps you capture more dynamic poses.</p>

<h3>Straights Against Curves</h3>

<p>Look for opportunities to place <strong>straight lines against curves</strong>:</p>

<ul>

<li>Women's hips often have a <strong>straight line</strong> down from the hip crest, followed by a curve.</li>

<li>Use <strong>straights and curves</strong> to emphasize structure and gesture.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Orthographic Drawing and Turning the Figure</h2>

<p>An effective way to understand the figure in three dimensions is through <strong>orthographic drawing</strong>:</p>

<ul>

<li>Draw the figure from multiple views: front, side, back, and three-quarter.</li>

<li>Use lines to align key points across different views.</li>

<li>This method helps you grasp how the figure turns in space.</li>

</ul>

<p>By exploring all sides of the figure, you gain a comprehensive understanding that removes fear of complex poses.</p>

<h2>Building Your Subconscious Art Engine</h2>

<p>The more you draw, the more you feed your <strong>subconscious art engine</strong>. Repetition and practice help embed these concepts into your mind. Over time, they'll become natural reactions as you draw.</p>

<h3>Repetition and Mileage</h3>

<ul>

<li><strong>Draw lots</strong>: The more you draw, the better you become.</li>

<li><strong>Repeat exercises</strong>: Each time you revisit a concept, it becomes clearer.</li>

<li><strong>Enjoy the process</strong>: Focus on the act of drawing, not just the end result.</li>

</ul>

<p>By embracing repetition, you expedite years of learning into a shorter time.</p>

<h2>Drawing Techniques and Tips</h2>

<h3>Using the Weight of Your Pencil</h3>

<ul>

<li><strong>Experiment with pencil pressure</strong>: Lighten your touch by 50% to improve your drawings.</li>

<li><strong>Vary your line quality</strong>: Use dark and light, broad and thin lines to add life to your drawings.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Big to Small</h3>

<ul>

<li>Start with <strong>big shapes</strong> and gradually move to <strong>smaller details</strong>.</li>

<li>This approach ensures you capture the overall form before focusing on specifics.</li>

</ul>

<h3>What's on the Other Side?</h3>

<ul>

<li>After drawing one side of the figure, ask yourself, <strong>"What's on the other side?"</strong></li>

<li>This helps maintain balance and proportion in your drawings.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Ghosting Back Lines</h3>

<ul>

<li>Instead of erasing mistakes, <strong>ghost back</strong> your lines by lightening them.</li>

<li>This keeps a history of your thought process and adds animation to your drawings.</li>

<li><strong>Every line is a thought</strong>, and layering lines compounds your understanding.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Drawing from Life and Imagination</h2>

<p>Combining life drawing with imagination enhances your skills:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Draw from life</strong>: Observing real models provides new information and challenges.</li>

<li><strong>Draw from imagination</strong>: Apply your understanding to create figures without reference.</li>

<li><strong>Design, don't just copy</strong>: Use your knowledge to interpret and design the figure.</li>

</ul>

<p>By doing both, you avoid relying on tropes and keep your work fresh and dynamic.</p>

<h2>Community and Teaching</h2>

<h3>Learning in Life Drawing Classes</h3>

<ul>

<li><strong>Life drawing classes</strong> provide a community of like-minded artists.</li>

<li><strong>Share knowledge</strong>: Even if you're new, sharing what you know benefits everyone.</li>

<li><strong>Learn from others</strong>: Observing different approaches broadens your understanding.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Teaching as a Way to Learn</h3>

<ul>

<li><strong>Teaching reinforces learning</strong>: Explaining concepts helps solidify your knowledge.</li>

<li><strong>Build connections</strong>: Teaching fosters relationships within the art community.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Embracing the Process</h2>

<p><strong>Enjoy every mark you make</strong>. The passion lies in the process, not just the end result.</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Draw without fear</strong>: Start drawings without worrying about mistakes.</li>

<li><strong>Accept that not every drawing will be perfect</strong>: Use "clangers" (less successful drawings) as learning opportunities.</li>

<li><strong>Focus on fundamentals</strong>: Revisit basic concepts regularly to keep skills sharp.</li>

</ul>

<p>By embracing the process, you remove fear and allow creativity to flourish.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p>The journey to becoming a better artist is filled with practice, patience, and joy. By exploring shapes and rhythms, using mnemonics, and embracing both gesture and structure, you unlock the power of osmosis in your art.</p>

<p>Remember:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Draw lots and often</strong></li>

<li><strong>Enjoy the process over the result</strong></li>

<li><strong>Continuously improve through practice</strong></li>

</ul>

<p>Get your pencils ready, and let's continue drawing together!</p>
