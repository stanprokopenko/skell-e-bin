<h2>Unlocking the Secrets of Creating Depth</h2>

<p>In this course, you'll <strong>learn how artists turn a flat surface into a deep world</strong>. Perspective is more than just drawing boxes and buildings, it <strong>applies to everything around us</strong>. By understanding perspective, you can draw anything you imagine in any position and style.</p>

<h2>Why Learn Perspective?</h2>

<p>Do you get ideas for images but find them difficult to draw? Do you struggle to depict subjects from different viewpoints? <strong>Learning perspective allows you to move beyond copying what you see</strong>. You'll be able to create your own scenes and bring your visions to life.</p>

<h2>The Foundations of Perspective</h2>

<p>We'll start with <strong>classic perspective</strong> which is 600 years of Renaissance knowledge. Establishing strong foundations, we'll explore how basic forms like <strong>boxes and spheres</strong> can represent many objects. By adjusting these forms, you can create anything, from simple feet to complex structures.</p>

<h2>The Power of Imagination</h2>

<p>When you draw from imagination, you <strong>create your own worlds</strong>. Artists who understand perspective can illustrate anything from any point of view. You'll learn how to make trees get smaller as they recede, draw people walking down a street, and render objects credibly.</p>

<h2>Treasure Hunt Project</h2>

<p>Your first project is to <strong>collect your favorite drawings by perspective masters</strong>. Seek out artworks that showcase perspective, like studies by Leonardo da Vinci, or environments by De Vries. Also, <strong>gather potential perspective problems</strong> you want to solve, questions and puzzles you care about.</p>

<h3>Examples of Perspective Problems</h3>

<ul>

<li><strong>How do arches get smaller as they recede?</strong> There's a science to it, and it's not difficult.</li>

<li><strong>Can you alter that science and still look credible?</strong> Yes, you can experiment while maintaining believability.</li>

<li><strong>How do you change the viewpoint of an object?</strong> Learn to draw something from a different angle.</li>

<li><strong>How do figures on a merry-go-round appear in perspective?</strong> Discover how they clump at the edges and spread out in the middle.</li>

</ul>

<p>If you're eager to tackle these challenges, <strong>you're in the right place</strong>.</p>
