<h2>Breaking the Rigidity of Graph Paper</h2>

<p>Graph paper often has a reputation among free spirits as being <strong>rigid</strong>. But you can ignore the rigidity of the lines and create <strong>abstract, organic drawings</strong>. Use the lines to <strong>ground yourself</strong> if needed and to remind you of <strong>level</strong>.</p>

<h2>Simple Perspective Tricks</h2>

<p>Graph paper provides a good rigid structure. Let's try the simplest <strong>perspective trick</strong> you might have learned in kindergarten:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Start with a square</strong> of three units.</li>

<li><strong>Repeat it</strong> on an offset back block of squares of the same size.</li>

<li><strong>Put them together</strong>, and a kind of <strong>3D effect</strong> appears.</li>

</ul>

<p>Let's assess the angles:</p>

<ul>

<li>The base is at <strong>90 degrees</strong>.</li>

<li>One angle is <strong>65 degrees</strong>.</li>

<li>Another angle is <strong>115 degrees</strong>.</li>

</ul>

<p>Think about how these angles interact.</p>

<h2>Reversing the Perspective</h2>

<p>Now, <strong>reverse the process</strong>:</p>

<ul>

<li>Draw the shapes in reverse.</li>

<li>This is so easy, a <strong>monkey could do it</strong>.</li>

<li>But as you continue, it <strong>gets tougher</strong>.</li>

</ul>

<h2>The 45-Degree Angle Exercise</h2>

<p>Let's <strong>look down on a block</strong> going back <strong>45 degrees</strong>:</p>

<ul>

<li>Draw it for <strong>five squares up</strong>.</li>

<li>It will also be <strong>five squares to the right</strong>, because 45 degrees is half of 90 and <strong>splits the square</strong>.</li>

</ul>

<p>Think this way:</p>

<ul>

<li>You get a <strong>45-degree angle</strong>, a perfectly equal diagonal slicing a 90-degree square.</li>

<li>You also get a <strong>135-degree angle</strong> at the top.</li>

<li><strong>45 and 135 degrees</strong> add up to <strong>180</strong>, there's <strong>something cosmic</strong> there.</li>

</ul>

<p>Including the secondary form clearly reads as <strong>two forms</strong>, one overlapping another.</p>

<h2>Facing the Challenge</h2>

<p>Now, <strong>reverse the 45-degree exercise</strong>:</p>

<ul>

<li>This is <strong>not so easy</strong>.</li>

<li>It takes attention and <strong>counting lines</strong>.</li>

<li><strong>Look back and forth</strong> to ensure it's the right dot.</li>

<li>Compare the <strong>flat pattern</strong>, the <strong>length of the lines</strong>, and the <strong>angles</strong>.</li>

<li>Remind yourself that now the <strong>large body is closer</strong> than the smaller one.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Embracing Complexity</h2>

<p>If this has been so easy that it has offended you, <strong>hang in there</strong>:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Your time is coming</strong>, and you'll do <strong>marvelous things</strong>.</li>

<li>You're eager for the <strong>challenge of visual complexity</strong> you want to create.</li>

<li>Be aware that as you dive in, it can get <strong>confusing</strong> and <strong>tangled</strong>.</li>

<li>But it's <strong>always solvable</strong>.</li>

<li>Recognize <strong>impossibilities</strong>, and you can <strong>fix them</strong> or <strong>flaunt them</strong>.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Exploring Different Kinds of Graph Paper</h2>

<p>Playing with graph paper offers variety:</p>

<ul>

<li>There are different kinds:<ul>

<li><strong>Quad ruled</strong>.</li>

<li>Grids with different degrees like <strong>triangle grids</strong> and <strong>tumbling block trapezoids</strong>.</li>

<li>Some are just <strong>dots</strong>, which are quieter.</li>

</ul>

</li>

<li>You can even <strong>make your own</strong> graph paper.</li>

</ul>

<h2>The Benefits of Graph Paper</h2>

<p>Even if you're not used to graph paper, consider its benefits:</p>

<ul>

<li>Artists like <strong>Kirsten Zerngebel</strong> ideate on graph paper.</li>

<li>It has never made her work look <strong>rigid</strong>.</li>

<li>If you learn how to <strong>use graph paper</strong> and keep it handy, it gives you a quick way to get <strong>measurable spatial ideas on paper</strong>.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Overcoming Misconceptions and Fears</h2>

<p>If the rigidity of graph paper puts you off, or if <strong>optical illusions</strong> strike terror into your heart, this is your chance to <strong>set that fear aside</strong> or <strong>conquer it</strong>:</p>

<ul>

<li>Look some optical illusions straight in the face and say, <strong>"I will get you!"</strong></li>

<li>It's an <strong>attitude thing</strong>.</li>

</ul>
