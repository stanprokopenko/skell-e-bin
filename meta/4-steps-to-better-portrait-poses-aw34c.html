<p>Posing is crucial in portrait drawing, especially during the gesture stage. It helps maintain the positioning and emotive expression of the head, neck, and shoulders. This lesson covers four essential steps: <strong>sizing the skull</strong>, <strong>leaning and tilting the head</strong>, <strong>positioning the jaw</strong>, and <strong>understanding basic perspective</strong>.</p>

<h2>Step 1: Sizing the Skull</h2>

<p>Start with a <strong>basic sphere</strong> to represent the skull. This sphere is a simplified version that you can customize by shaving and whittling it down. Heads are rarely completely vertical, so exaggerate leans and tilts to add character.</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Use references</strong> to visualize two-dimensional leans.</li>

<li><strong>Catalog emotions</strong> seen in images to understand body language.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Step 2: Positioning the Jaw</h2>

<p>Notice the <strong>position and placement of the jaw</strong>. Female skulls may have a narrower jaw. Add fuller shapes for the neck using C and S curves. The traps hold the head in position, represented by a C curve. The front of the neck is longer and more passive, while the ribcage is off-angle, higher in the back, and lower in the front.</p>

<h2>Step 3: Center Line</h2>

<p>Match the <strong>center line</strong> to the model's head. Ensure the center line cuts the chin correctly for a three-quarter turn. Align the brow and ear positions to maintain accuracy.</p>

<h2>Step 4: Proportions</h2>

<p>Understand the <strong>proportions of the face</strong>. Develop primary structures for the skull and jaw, and address features as sculptures on top of these primary forms. Use a rough system of proportions, such as halves and thirds, and orient lines based on observed features.</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Key points</strong>: base of the nose, cheekbone structure, and fat on the face.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Step 5: Advanced Proportions and Planes</h2>

<p>Transition to understanding the <strong>side plane of the head</strong>. Identify the hairline, base of the nose, temple, and back of the skull. Sculpt the head rather than just organizing space, and approximate the reference with plane geometry.</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Position the ear</strong> in the back quarter of the head and understand its five planes.</li>

<li><strong>Customize the jaw's angle and shape</strong>.</li>

<li>Use rhythms to establish side planes.</li>

<li>Develop the sockets, considering lean and plane changes.</li>

<li>Understand the nasal aperture and cheekbone structure.</li>

<li>Consider the denture sphere and the contribution of teeth before adding lips.</li>

<li>Take into account subcutaneous fat deposits and facial anatomy.</li>

<li>The canthral ligament affects the tilt and aesthetic beauty of the eye.</li>

<li>Women have more retroobicularis oris fat, often accentuated with makeup.</li>

</ul>

<p>This roadmap provides a <strong>perspective blueprint for drawing heads</strong>. It aids in invention, light and shadow orientation, and character creation. You can distort and create variations of heads or characters by pushing and pulling shapes.</p>
