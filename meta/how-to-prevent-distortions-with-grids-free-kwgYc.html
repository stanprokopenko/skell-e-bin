<h2>What's in Premium?</h2>

<p>In the full lesson, we explore how to use grids to improve your line directions and proportions. You'll learn how grids guide your lines and help maintain accuracy, and how to avoid common mistakes like reversing grid lines that cause divergence instead of convergence. We discuss the importance of foreshortening and how daring to apply it adds dynamism to your drawings.</p>

<p>You'll gain insights into managing distortion by understanding perspective and adjusting vanishing points. The lesson covers estimating proportions through trial and error, encouraging you to compare your drawings with ortho references. We emphasize the value of drawing through forms and embracing rough sketches to refine your work.</p>

<p>For complex objects, we offer strategies to handle them without getting overwhelmed by grids. You'll learn to focus on essential grid lines and ignore unnecessary ones to keep your drawings clear. Throughout the lesson, we encourage you to embrace the learning process and view mistakes as opportunities to improve your skills.</p>
