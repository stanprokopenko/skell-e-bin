<p>I like to introduce "sidebars" as brief discussions to enhance our understanding of art concepts. These are little detours that help us grasp the bigger picture.</p>

<h2>The Yearbook Principle</h2>

<p>One such concept I learned in art school is the <strong>"yearbook principle."</strong> This principle focuses on capturing the <strong>essence of a subject</strong> in drawing. It's about seeing beyond the details and getting to the heart of what makes a subject unique.</p>

<h2>Application to Drawing Faces</h2>

<p>The yearbook principle is particularly useful when drawing faces. It's all about capturing a person's essence. Think about how you can recognize classmates from yearbook photos, even if you haven't seen them for decades. Those small, indistinct photos still allow you to recognize people by their overall head shape and silhouette. This principle teaches us to focus on these big shapes rather than getting lost in minute details.</p>

<h2>Personal Illustration Example</h2>

<p>To illustrate this principle, I retrieved my high school yearbook. I was involved in creating its cover and internal artwork, which had a jungle theme. I contributed watercolor and pen-and-ink illustrations. This experience taught me a lot about capturing the essence of a subject.</p>

<h2>Recognizing People</h2>

<p>Recognizing a person involves understanding their unique features, like their head shape and how their hair frames their face. The yearbook principle emphasizes the importance of these <strong>big shapes over small details</strong> in capturing likeness.</p>

<h2>Techniques for Capturing Essence</h2>

<p>To capture the essence, I use a technique of blowing out photos to black and white. This helps me focus on the basic shapes. Squinting is another useful technique. It helps eliminate unnecessary details, allowing me to focus on essential shapes and contrasts. Squinting aids in achieving the yearbook effect by simplifying the visual information.</p>

<h2>Importance of Accurate Placement</h2>

<p>The principle is about placing important darks accurately to capture the essence of a subject. When painting, it's crucial to refine the drawing continuously, even as you add paint. Achieving a solid feel in artwork comes from accurately placing shapes and capturing the essence. Adding details like halftones and edges is secondary to capturing the core essence.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p>In conclusion, the yearbook principle is about capturing the essence and likeness of a subject effectively. As I return to the drawing process, I keep this principle in mind, emphasizing the importance of capturing the essence over getting bogged down in details.</p>
