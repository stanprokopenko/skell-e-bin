<h2>What's in Premium?</h2>

<p>Discover how to focus your figure drawings using targeted “filters,” such as emphasizing gesture or structuring forms as tubes or boxes. Explore ways to simplify complex areas, tilt objects for added depth, and iterate to refine shape and proportion. You’ll also see practical demonstrations on controlling line confidence, creating solid three-dimensional volumes, and layering filters step by step. By combining these approaches, you can sharpen your technique and develop a more personal drawing style.</p>
