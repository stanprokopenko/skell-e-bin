<h2>Understanding Gesture</h2>

<p>Sometimes it's hard to know <strong>what gesture is</strong> or <strong>why we should use it</strong>. Figures feel most convincing when they exhibit a type of <strong>movement</strong>. Instead of focusing on the outside shape, we should appreciate the abstraction and internal dynamics of the figure.</p>

<h2>The Role of Asymmetry and Rhythm</h2>

<p><strong>Asymmetry is fantastic</strong> for creating interest. By offsetting the apexes of curves, we generate a natural rhythm that draws the viewer's attention. This is different from the common mistake of drawing parallel lines, which creates closure and stiffness.</p>

<h2>My Approach to Gesture Drawing</h2>

<p>In my gesture drawings, <strong>every line represents a part</strong>, and the spacing in between represents the <strong>joint</strong> or transition between parts. I focus on creating movement through the offset relationship of apexes, ensuring each line leads the eye to the next.</p>

<h3>Steps in My Gesture Drawing Process</h3>

<ol>

<li><strong>Start with the head</strong> as a simple shape.</li>

<li>Move through the <strong>spine</strong> with four lines:<ul>

<li>Cervical (neck)</li>

<li>Thoracic (upper back)</li>

<li>Stretching line (front of the body)</li>

<li>Lumbar (lower back)</li>

</ul>

</li>

<li>Indicate the <strong>pelvis</strong>, focusing on the weight-bearing side.</li>

<li>Draw the <strong>limbs</strong>:<ul>

<li><strong>Legs</strong>: 2-3 lines each, starting with the weight-bearing leg.</li>

<li><strong>Arms</strong>: 2-3 lines each, ensuring they build off existing lines.</li>

</ul>

</li>

<li>Add <strong>wrapping lines</strong> to show the 3D tilt of each part.</li>

</ol>

<p>In total, my gestures use around <strong>16 to 17 lines</strong>.</p>

<h2>Emphasizing Movement and Rhythm</h2>

<p>I aim to make my lines central to forms, emphasizing <strong>asymmetry</strong> and <strong>rhythm</strong>. I avoid vertical or horizontal lines, preferring diagonals to keep the figure dynamic. <strong>C-curves</strong> and <strong>S-curves</strong> are essential tools for creating a sense of motion.</p>

<h3>Drawing Feet and Hands</h3>

<p>I simplify feet to basic shapes like triangles or dynamic socks, adjusting them based on the viewpoint (front, three-quarter, profile). For hands, I make the forearm and hand one continuous line, keeping the gesture flowing.</p>

<h2>Tips for Gesture Drawing Practice</h2>

<ul>

<li><strong>Practice at your own pace</strong>. Speed comes with repetition, but understanding is more important.</li>

<li><strong>Use line weight</strong> to suggest depth, especially in foreshortening.</li>

<li><strong>Check proportions</strong> by comparing the height of the figure to the head size.</li>

<li><strong>Assess balance</strong> by drawing a center of gravity line from the pit of the neck down to the supporting foot.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Personalizing Your Gesture Drawing</h2>

<p>Every gesture process is unique. I encourage you to develop your own approach, using these steps as a framework. Remember, what's important is not replicating exactly what's in front of you, but creating a drawing that's interesting and engaging.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p>By focusing on <strong>asymmetry</strong>, <strong>rhythm</strong>, and the internal dynamics of the figure, we can create gesture drawings that are full of movement and life. Keep practicing, and don't be afraid to adapt these methods to suit your own style.</p>
