<h2>Starting with a Reference</h2>

<p>In this session, I focus on pushing our invention-based practices by starting with a reference and creating distinctly different versions. It's not just about drawing the same pose from different angles. Instead, we imagine the story, explore what's happening, and think about how things might be different.</p>

<h2>Imagining Different Poses</h2>

<p>I like the idea of a hammer swing, but perhaps it's a bit boring in its standard form. So, I ask, what if the hammer is really heavy? The figure could be burdened by lifting it, causing his back to lean further to support the weight. I enjoy putting the figure <strong>off balance</strong>, challenging usual poses.</p>

<p>Maybe he has lost his footing, knee buckling under him, up on the ball of his foot. Perhaps he started to swing and then lost control, the weight pulling his whole body back. I can show the hand releasing the hammer, which is careening towards the ground.</p>

<h2>Emphasizing Imbalance</h2>

<p>In inventing these poses, I try to take what I see and do the opposite as an exercise. Instead of a balanced pose with a center of gravity, I aim for <strong>imbalance</strong>, <strong>failure</strong>, or <strong>surprise</strong>. One of the best ways to show dynamic imbalance is by building off <strong>diagonals</strong>. Positioning limbs to create strong diagonals enhances movement and instability.</p>

<h2>Exploring Different Actions</h2>

<p>I think about different stages of an action. Inspired by "How to Draw Comics the Marvel Way", I consider showing the beginning or the end of an action. For example, I imagine the figure stepping forward and burying the hammer, organizing the body to move forward and emphasize the swing.</p>

<h2>Adding Story and Emotion</h2>

<p>Alternatively, I imagine a cosplay guy pretending to be Thor who accidentally sledgehammered his neighbor's cat. Now, he's ashamed and apologetic, head low, body turned away, hand extended in apology. This adds emotion and narrative to the pose.</p>

<h2>Having Fun with Invention</h2>

<p>This technique lets me quickly explore figures and have fun with invention. By playing around and letting my imagination go wild, I can create poses that are dynamic and expressive. Hopefully, your thought process isn't as disturbed as mine, but if it is, this method helps you get those figures down quickly and enjoy the process.</p>
