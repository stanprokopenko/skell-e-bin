<h2>Eye Placement and Basic Construction</h2>

<p>When placing the eye in a portrait, we use facial landmarks as guides:</p>

<ul>

<li>The wing of the nose relates to the corner of the eye</li>

<li>The corner of the mouth often aligns with the center of the eye</li>

<li>Use the existing proportion line for the center of the eye top to bottom</li>

</ul>

<p>To begin constructing the eye:</p>

<ol>

<li>Roughly sketch a sphere for the eyeball</li>

<li>Look for opportunities to overlap the sphere with the socket for a more form-based relationship</li>

</ol>

<h2>Eye Anatomy and Structure</h2>

<p>The eye is held in place by the <strong>canthral ligament</strong>, which creates a boxy area at the corner of the eye. This ligament attaches to the inside of the temple.</p>

<p><strong>Tarsus plates</strong> form the eyelids:</p>

<ul>

<li>They have a planar, somewhat sharp surface</li>

<li>Corners of the plates are often areas for highlights</li>

</ul>

<p>The <strong>canthral tilt</strong> is crucial for customizing an eye:</p>

<ul>

<li>It refers to the two-dimensional axis of the eye across</li>

<li>The tilt can be low to high or high to low</li>

<li>A low to high tilt (higher on the outside) is often considered more aesthetically pleasing</li>

</ul>

<p>When drawing eyelids:</p>

<ol>

<li>Start from the canthral ligament</li>

<li>Trace the form of the eye sphere</li>

<li>Return to the initial alignment of the canthral ligament and tilt</li>

</ol>

<p>Remember that <strong>eyelids are asymmetrical</strong>. The upper lid's peak is usually higher closer to the nose, while the lower lid's peak is higher further from the nose.</p>

<h2>Fat Pads Around the Eye</h2>

<p>Several fat pads surround and protect the eye:</p>

<ol>

<li><strong>Nasal fat</strong>: Located in the inner corner, pinched by the canthral ligament</li>

<li><strong>Pre-tarsus fat</strong>: Rare, sits on the eyelid (as seen in actor Steve Buscemi)</li>

<li><strong>Lateral fat</strong>: On the outer edge of the eye</li>

<li><strong>Upper eyelid fat</strong> (roof fat): Can impact the appearance of the upper eyelid</li>

<li><strong>Lower eyelid fat</strong> (souf fat): Important in aging, covers the cheekbone</li>

</ol>

<p>These fat pads are held in place by the <strong>orbital septum</strong>, which weakens with age, leading to changes in appearance.</p>

<h2>Eye Socket Form</h2>

<p>The eye socket is not a flat plane. To depict its form:</p>

<ol>

<li>Use an S-curve to show the twisting of the socket</li>

<li>The inner part of the socket recedes, creating more shadow</li>

<li>The outer part becomes more prominent near the temple</li>

</ol>

<h2>Drawing Techniques</h2>

<ul>

<li>Use organic details like eyebrows to suggest underlying structure</li>

<li>Choose strategic points to change line direction, signaling plane changes</li>

<li>Balance between finding all planes and artfully hiding them in the final drawing</li>

</ul>

<h2>Aging and the Eye</h2>

<p>As we age, several changes occur:</p>

<ul>

<li>Fat pads shift and sometimes herniate</li>

<li>Underlying bone structure becomes more visible</li>

<li>Wrinkles form perpendicular to muscle movement</li>

</ul>

<p>To depict an older eye:</p>

<ol>

<li>Show more prominent bone structure</li>

<li>Indicate dropped fat pads, especially under the eye</li>

<li>Add wrinkles sparingly and strategically</li>

</ol>

<p>To de-age an eye:</p>

<ol>

<li>Raise the malar (cheek) fat</li>

<li>Soften plane changes</li>

<li>Reduce the visibility of underlying bone structure</li>

</ol>

<h2>Practical Application</h2>

<p>When drawing eyes:</p>

<ol>

<li>Start with basic placement and construction</li>

<li>Add structural details based on anatomy</li>

<li>Consider the subject's age and adjust accordingly</li>

<li>Use line weight and placement to suggest form without overworking</li>

</ol>

<p>Remember, understanding these structures helps create more realistic and age-appropriate drawings, even when depicting younger subjects.</p>
