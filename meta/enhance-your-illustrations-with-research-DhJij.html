<p>In this article, I'll walk you through my process for creating a Spirited Away fan art piece. I'll share how I approached research, initial sketches, thumbnails, and the steps I took to finalize the illustration.</p>

<h2>Research and Initial Sketches</h2>

<p>Before diving into the final piece, I spent time familiarizing myself with <strong>Miyazaki's art style</strong> and the characters from Spirited Away. I hadn't drawn anything from this film before, so I needed to understand the design elements and aesthetics.</p>

<p>I started by sketching the characters, even though my first attempts didn't look great. It's important to <strong>push through early sketches</strong> that don't meet expectations. By continuously drawing, I began to get more comfortable with the characters and the style.</p>

<p>I focused on <strong>drawing Haku</strong>, the dragon character, as I found him fascinating, cool and a bit scary, but not frightening. Practicing these sketches helped me capture the mood I wanted for the piece.</p>

<h2>Exploring Ideas and Inspiration</h2>

<p>As I sketched, I allowed myself to explore different characters and elements. Sometimes, <strong>drawing without a concrete plan</strong> can lead to unexpected inspiration. I was reminded of other characters and scenes that I enjoyed, and I considered including them in my artwork.</p>

<p>This phase is also about <strong>evoking a feeling</strong>. For me, it was about channeling the emotions and atmosphere from Spirited Away and personal experiences that resonated with the film.</p>

<h2>Thumbnails and Composition</h2>

<p>Next, I moved on to creating thumbnails to plan the composition. My initial idea was a horizontal orientation focusing on Sen in a close-up shot. However, I realized that I wanted to <strong>include more characters and Easter eggs</strong> in the piece.</p>

<p>I experimented with different poses and compositions, eventually deciding on a scene where <strong>Sen and Haku are flying over a night market</strong>. This idea was inspired by a personal experience at the Raohe Night Market in Taiwan, which reminded me of Spirited Away both in atmosphere and in a humorous incident where we lost and found family members.</p>

<h2>Line Art and Flats</h2>

<p>With the composition decided, I moved on to the <strong>line art</strong>. I didn't start with a pencil sketch, instead, I went straight into drawing the final lines. My goal was to create a piece that <strong>looks like a Spirited Away scene</strong>, but also includes elements from other Studio Ghibli films.</p>

<p>In the <strong>flat color stage</strong>, I was already thinking about the <strong>color palette</strong>. I wanted to keep the colors cohesive, so I chose colors that were close to each other in tone. For background characters, I adjusted their colors to fit within this palette, avoiding a rainbow effect that might distract from the main focus.</p>

<h2>Adding Lighting and Shading</h2>

<p>I then added <strong>lighting and shading</strong>, bringing depth to the illustration. By applying a highlight pass, I unified the elements with a consistent light source, the glow of the night market. I used gradients to draw the viewer's eye toward the center, and to balance the composition.</p>

<p>At this stage, I also <strong>adjusted the values</strong> to ensure that the main characters stood out against the background. It's crucial to control contrast to guide the viewer's attention.</p>

<h2>Finalizing the Piece</h2>

<p>In the final version, I further <strong>refined the color palette</strong> to enhance the nighttime atmosphere. I compressed the background colors to a middle-tone purple, allowing the main characters to pop. The line art served as the darkest value, defining the forms amidst the subdued colors.</p>

<p>My aim was to create a piece that feels cohesive and captures the essence of Spirited Away, while also including subtle nods to other Studio Ghibli films. From a distance, it appears as a straightforward scene, but upon closer inspection, fans can discover the hidden details.</p>

<p>Creating this piece was a journey of combining personal experiences with inspiration from the film. By infusing my own memories and emotions, I felt more connected to the artwork, and I believe that connection translates to the viewer.</p>
