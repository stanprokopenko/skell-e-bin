<h2>What's in Premium?</h2>

<p>In this premium lesson, we refine a cast drawing by adding values and adjusting edges. We start by adjusting proportions, like widening the side of the head for better accuracy. We simplify and unite shapes to enhance the composition.</p>

<p>We expand our value range to depict subtle differences within categories like <strong>deep accents</strong>, <strong>shadows</strong>, <strong>half-tones</strong>, and <strong>highlights</strong>. We explore tools and techniques, using erasers, powder, and shammies to adjust values and soften areas.</p>

<p>We add core shadows to create three-dimensional form while avoiding overuse. We balance detail by simplifying shadows and focusing on lights. We design clean, contained shapes and adjust planes and halftones with appropriate pencils.</p>

<p>We discuss handling "floaters" and simplifying details as distance from the focal point increases. Finally, we emphasize stepping back to evaluate the drawing, making final adjustments, and knowing when to stop.</p>
