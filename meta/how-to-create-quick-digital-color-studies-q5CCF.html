<p>I'll show you how to create a new painting using a previously made line drawing and enhance it with a split complementary color palette. This process involves generating a line drawing from an existing study, organizing layers in Photoshop, and applying color theory to create a visually appealing painting. I'll also share tips for achieving realism and color harmony in your artwork.</p>

<h2>Generating a Line Drawing</h2>

<p>First, let's generate a line drawing from a previous study:</p>

<ol>

<li><strong>Duplicate the Layer</strong>: This preserves the original artwork.</li>

<li><strong>Use Filter &gt; Stylize &gt; Find Edges</strong>: In Photoshop, this filter helps create a basic line drawing.</li>

<li><strong>Adjust Levels</strong>: Enhance the whites and darks to improve the line drawing.</li>

<li><strong>Erase Unnecessary Details</strong>: Remove extra lines, especially those you plan to refine later.</li>

<li><strong>Paint Over Areas Not Needed</strong>: Use white to cover brushstroke outlines and other unnecessary details.</li>

<li><strong>Hide the Original Painting</strong>: Create a new layer on top and fill it with white. Name this layer "line drawing two."</li>

<li><strong>Set the New Layer to Multiply</strong>: This allows the line drawing to show through.</li>

</ol>

<h2>Organizing Layers in Photoshop</h2>

<p>Proper layer organization is crucial for a smooth workflow:</p>

<ol>

<li><strong>Group Layers</strong>: Shift-click the layers you want to group and press Control + G.</li>

<li><strong>Unlock the Background Layer</strong>: Double-click to unlock it, hit OK, and then include it in the group.</li>

<li><strong>Group the Top Two Layers</strong>: This helps keep your workspace organized.</li>

</ol>

<h2>Applying a Split Complementary Palette</h2>

<p>A split complementary palette can add depth and interest to your painting:</p>

<ol>

<li><strong>Define the Palette</strong>: Split one side of the color wheel into two neighboring hues.</li>

<li><strong>Rotate the Palette</strong>: For example, rotate towards green for a green monster and purple shadows.</li>

<li><strong>Indicate and Rearrange Colors</strong>: Make them easily accessible.</li>

<li><strong>Start with Neutralized Colors</strong>: Build saturation from there.</li>

<li><strong>Block in Temperature Delineations</strong>: Make the foreground and character warmer, and the background cooler.</li>

<li><strong>Use Hue Saturation</strong>: Darken and increase saturation to give the painting a quick punch.</li>

</ol>

<h2>Enhancing the Painting with Lighting and Shadows</h2>

<p>Lighting and shadows can significantly enhance your painting:</p>

<ol>

<li><strong>Introduce All Three Colors Early</strong>: Mix them to create intermediary hues.</li>

<li><strong>Scumble in Influences of Green and Orange</strong>: Deepen purples for shadows.</li>

<li><strong>Rough in Water</strong>: Use lighter purples for details like eyeballs and irises.</li>

<li><strong>Encourage Sketchiness Early</strong>: This fosters exploration.</li>

<li><strong>Use Linear Dodge Mode</strong>: Brush in lighting to make elements more vibrant.</li>

<li><strong>Switch to a Harder Brush</strong>: Carve into soft brush strokes for refinement.</li>

<li><strong>Adjust Local Values</strong>: Start in the correct range for different objects.</li>

<li><strong>Use Ambient Occlusion</strong>: Indicate intersections and shadows, smudging hard edges for a softer look.</li>

<li><strong>Merge the Line Drawing with the Painting</strong>: This keeps the process free-flowing.</li>

<li><strong>Fill Out the Sky and Forest</strong>: Use smaller shapes to make the scene feel more populated.</li>

<li><strong>Work on Occlusion Shadows</strong>: Vary darkness and avoid repetitive shapes.</li>

</ol>

<h2>Practical Tips for Realistic and Harmonious Color Use</h2>

<p>Here are some tips to ensure your painting looks realistic and harmonious:</p>

<ol>

<li><strong>Flip the Canvas</strong>: Check for temperature consistency.</li>

<li><strong>Use a Watercolor Brush</strong>: Glaze color temperature changes.</li>

<li><strong>Experiment with Blending Modes</strong>: See how they modify colors.</li>

<li><strong>Consider Light Direction and Saturation</strong>: This is crucial for highlights.</li>

<li><strong>Increase Occlusion Shadows</strong>: Under the bridge and on the monster's belly.</li>

<li><strong>Balance Warm and Cool Colors</strong>: Prevent areas from looking too yellow or too purple.</li>

<li><strong>Use Colors from the Palette in Multiple Areas</strong>: This ensures harmony.</li>

<li><strong>Add Subtle Color Shifts and Micro Comparisons</strong>: These add vibrancy.</li>

<li><strong>Break Lines and Add Imperfections</strong>: This makes forms look more realistic.</li>

<li><strong>Study Real-Life Scenes and Photographs</strong>: Apply real-world logic to your colors.</li>

<li><strong>Carry a Sketchbook or Digital Device</strong>: For plein air painting to improve light analysis skills.</li>

<li><strong>Use the Lasso Tool and Screen Mode</strong>: Adjust background light to enhance contrast.</li>

<li><strong>Ensure Consistency in Light Direction</strong>: Especially with direct sunlight.</li>

<li><strong>Add Subtle Highlights and Details</strong>: Enhance realism, like in the monster's eyes and fur.</li>

<li><strong>Spread Colors Throughout the Painting</strong>: For a cohesive look.</li>

<li><strong>Use Overlay Brushes Sparingly</strong>: Add warm glows and bounce light without overdoing it.</li>

<li><strong>Populate the Painting with All Chosen Colors</strong>: Balance warm and cool areas.</li>

<li><strong>Add Micro Movements in Color</strong>: Contribute to appealing color work.</li>

</ol>

<p>By following these steps and tips, you can create a new painting that is both visually appealing and harmonious, using a previously made line drawing and a split complementary color palette.</p>
