<h2>The Importance of Hand Pressure Sensitivity</h2>

<p>When you start applying theory about values, your hand might not want to cooperate. <strong>Developing pressure sensitivity</strong> in your hand is crucial to control values. With a pencil, pushing harder makes it darker, and pushing lighter makes it lighter.</p>

<p>There are infinite values, and you're trying to target a specific one. You need the ability to control subtle differences in pressure. As you draw, you'll adapt to the pencil you are holding. An HB reacts differently than a 2B, 4B, or 6B. It's not about learning one specific amount of pressure, it's about having the control to adjust by just <strong>5% less</strong> or <strong>12% more</strong>.</p>

<p>This is a physical skill that requires practice, like being an athlete. You need to develop the muscles and dexterity in your hand over time.</p>

<h2>Common Shading Issues</h2>

<p>When you start learning how to shade, two common issues often arise:</p>

<h3>Spotty Shadows</h3>

<p>Spotty shadows occur when you have <strong>holes in your shading</strong>, where you didn't fill in certain areas, and the white of the paper shines through. This results in a messy, inconsistent look.</p>

<h3>Inconsistencies in Pressure</h3>

<p>This happens when you've filled in the entire area, but some parts are darker and some are lighter due to inconsistent pressure. The values are all over the place because you lacked control or didn't clean up those little areas.</p>

<p><strong>Holes and inconsistencies create noise</strong>. Sometimes noise can be good, but if it's in an area where you didn't intend it, it becomes a distraction. Not being able to put clean tone anywhere in your drawing is a common issue.</p>

<h2>Warm-Up Exercise: Practicing Clean Tone</h2>

<p>Let's start warming up and practicing so you can get through this stage quickly.</p>

<h3>Starting the Exercise</h3>

<p>Begin by drawing a rectangle or square, size doesn't matter much, maybe a few inches wide. Then start shading it at any angle that is comfortable for you. Turn the page if you need to. The goal is to make your shading consistent.</p>

<p>If you see yourself deviating from the initial value, you can go back and clean it up, or fill in the whole thing and then clean up the patches later.</p>

<h3>Techniques for Consistent Shading</h3>

<p><strong>Consistency in your strokes</strong> is key. Overlap each stroke the same amount, and keep the pressure consistent. This will create a uniform value.</p>

<p>What often happens is you create gaps, sometimes overlapping, sometimes with big or small gaps, due to a lack of control. This creates noise.</p>

<p>Sometimes noise is good, like using hatch marks as cross contours to show volume. But if you intended to lay down a clean area, you need to have the ability to do it cleanly.</p>

<p>As you practice, you'll make little gaps, and that's okay. Keep trying and go back to fill them in. Aim to get it as close as you can before the cleanup stage at the very end.</p>

<h3>Different Shading Techniques</h3>

<p>There are various techniques you can use:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Lines with Lifting</strong>: You're lifting the pencil off the page at the end of each stroke.</li>

<li><strong>Little Circles (No Lifting)</strong>: You make small, overlapping circles without lifting the pencil. This can create a cleaner tone.</li>

</ul>

<p>I prefer the little circles technique. By not lifting the pencil, it helps me create a more even tone.</p>

<h3>Adjusting the Value</h3>

<p>I chose a middle value for my shading. Once you've established your value, stick to it throughout the area. You're not practicing gradations here, you're practicing clean tone.</p>

<p>If you notice areas that are lighter or darker than the rest, go back lightly, and <strong>add another layer</strong> to even it out. You can also <strong>subtract</strong>, if some spots are too dark, use a kneaded eraser to blot them out.</p>

<p>Sometimes a small amount of noise is fine and not distracting. But if you're practicing clean tone, you may want to go in and <strong>clean up</strong> any little dots to make them consistent.</p>

<h3>Multiple Layers Approach</h3>

<p>Another method is to build up your shading with <strong>multiple layers</strong>. Start lighter than your target value, and as you apply more layers, it removes the squiggles and spreads them out into smaller ones. This makes them look less like a pattern and more like the texture of the paper.</p>

<p>By layering, you get multiple attempts to reach the final result. It's a lot easier when you do it in stages. It takes longer, but if you want clean tone, you'll get a better result.</p>

<p>As you add each layer, look ahead and decide if you need to darken an area or clean up any spottiness. If you enter an area where the previous layer got too dark, lighten your touch in that spot. You're fixing previous mistakes with new layers.</p>

<h3>Using the Flat Plane of Your Pencil</h3>

<p>Creating a <strong>little flat plane on the tip of your pencil</strong> can help. Use that flat plane to shade instead of just the tip. If you use just the tip, your lines are thinner, and it takes longer since you'll need more lines to fill an area.</p>

<p>If you're working on highly textured paper and trying to remove some of that texture noise, sometimes the only way is to use the tip to get into the crevices. But with smooth paper, using the flat plane is more efficient.</p>

<h2>Using Blending Tools</h2>

<h3>Blending Stumps and Fingers</h3>

<p>Blending stumps and your finger can be useful, but use them when they make sense. For this warm-up, the point is to practice <strong>hand control</strong>. If you rely on blending tools to clean up, it's not helping you develop that control.</p>

<p>When you're trying to get the best result possible with your drawing, blending tools come in handy. For example, if you have some noise in an area, you can use a blending stump to spread the tone and fill in gaps you missed with the pencil.</p>

<p>Using your finger is quick, but be cautious. If your hands are sweaty or oily, you might get grease on your paper, which can be hard to erase. It can also prevent you from making changes later.</p>

<h2>Adjusting Your Grip</h2>

<p>Your grip can affect your shading:</p>

<h3>Tripod Grip</h3>

<p>This is the standard way of holding a pencil, for detailed work and using the tip of the pencil.</p>

<h3>Overhand Grip</h3>

<p>When shading larger areas or trying to go faster, the <strong>overhand grip</strong> is helpful. Instead of holding the pencil underhand, you hold it overhand. This allows you to use the <strong>side of the pencil</strong>, giving you a thicker stroke and covering more area quickly.</p>

<p>Using the side of the pencil can create more <strong>paper texture</strong> showing through. This isn't necessarily bad, you might want that, but be aware of it.</p>

<p>You can start with this base and then do another layer with the tip to fill it in and make it more even.</p>

<h2>Embracing Paper Texture</h2>

<p>I don't mind a little bit of paper texture, in fact, I kind of like it. It's one of the major things that separates digital from traditional art. The materials and surfaces you work on have a specific texture that comes through, and this makes it look very natural.</p>

<p>Digital artists often try to replicate that texture with digital tools. Personally, I prefer the natural look. When digital artists add noise and texture to their art, I love it. It's my personal preference, so I don't shy away from it, I just try to <strong>learn to control it</strong>.</p>

<p>The whole point is <strong>control</strong>, mastery of the tools. You want to have the ability to go from one look to another.</p>

<h2>Practicing Different Values</h2>

<p>When you do these exercises on your own, do more of them. Maybe do three boxes, a lighter, medium, and darker one. You don't have to go to pure black, you don't want to destroy your paper. Just make sure you stay within the range of the pencil you are using.</p>

<p>Another thing you can do is try to <strong>choose a specific value</strong> before you start. Look at the table you're working on and say, "I want to match the value of the table." Now you have a target. It can be anything, a wall, an object, matching that value helps you have a goal in mind before you start shading, instead of it being random.</p>

<h2>Introducing Charcoal</h2>

<p>I want you to do these exercises with a graphite pencil, but I also mentioned charcoal pencils earlier. <strong>Charcoal is much easier to spread</strong> and quicker to get down on paper than graphite. That also means it's harder to control because it's easier to spread.</p>

<p>Once you learn to control it, you can get a big area of tone filled in very quickly. Doing this with a graphite pencil would take you ten times longer.</p>

<p>You don't have to start using charcoal now, but if you're excited and interested, go for it. This is a great tool for shading, but graphite is also great.</p>

<p>When I was studying as a student full-time, I used both all the time. I practiced with charcoal in my life drawings because when a model is up there, you've got to go quick. But then I'd go home, get out the graphite pencil, and spend twelve hours on a drawing. This allowed me to focus and not let speed rush my thoughts.</p>

<p>Charcoal helps you learn to quickly indicate things correctly, while graphite helps you focus on every area and make good decisions. They both have their value.</p>

<p>For this course, if you're going to choose one, let's stick with the graphite pencil. But if you want to start exploring both, I have lots of videos with charcoal you can check out. I'll probably occasionally throw in a little charcoal demo in this course as well, just because it's fun.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p>Go ahead and warm up by practicing clean shading and tone. Develop your hand pressure sensitivity, work on consistent shading techniques, and explore different grips and materials. This practice will help you gain control and mastery over your tools.</p>
