<p>Creating depth on a flat piece of paper is a fundamental challenge in art. To trick the eye into seeing a third dimension, you can use five key techniques:</p>

<h2>Diminution</h2>

<p>**Things get smaller as they go away. ** Objects appear smaller the farther they are from the viewer. Using size to indicate distance makes elements seem more distant. Remember, closer equals bigger, farther equals smaller.</p>

<h2>Convergence</h2>

<p><strong>Parallel lines meet at vanishing points.</strong> When lines recede into space, they converge at a point on the horizon. This is the basis of one-point, two-point, or even multiple-point perspective. Convergence helps you lay out scenes with depth by aligning lines toward vanishing points.</p>

<h2>Foreshortening</h2>

<p><strong>Looking along a thing changes its shape.</strong> A long object appears shorter when one end is closer to you. Foreshortening can be tricky, but mastering it adds a convincing sense of three-dimensionality to your drawings. Practice drawing objects from different angles to understand how their proportions change.</p>

<h2>Overlap</h2>

<p><strong>Close covers distant.</strong> Overlapping elements show which objects are in front and which are behind. This simple trick creates depth instinctively. It's widely used, from children's drawings to cartoons, and is essential for depicting figures and natural forms.</p>

<h2>Atmosphere</h2>

<p><strong>Distant things fade.</strong> Also known as aerial perspective, this technique uses the effects of air and atmosphere. Distant elements may appear lighter, darker, bluer, or grayer. Adjusting tones and colors can enhance the sense of depth in your artwork.</p>

<p>Refer to this list when composing your drawings. You don't have to use every trick in each piece. Sometimes, adding or removing one can improve your design. Experiment to find what works best for your art.</p>

<p><strong>Assignment:</strong> Review your favorite images. Rate each one on a scale of 1 to 5 for how they utilize these depth techniques. This practice will deepen your understanding of creating space on a flat surface.</p>
