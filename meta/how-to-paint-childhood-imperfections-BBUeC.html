<p><strong>Painting Techniques and Focus</strong></p>

<p>Painting the outside of a subject can help you focus on the drawing, especially around the face. This approach is particularly useful when capturing the essence of childhood, with its inherent imperfections like messy faces. These imperfections are a recurring theme in gallery works, highlighting the realness of childhood.</p>

<p><strong>Managing Light and Shadow</strong></p>

<p>When entering into shadow areas, especially around the chin, it's crucial to adjust your measurements. Shadows surrounded by light should be managed carefully to avoid them appearing as isolated dark spots. Lighten shadows in light areas to prevent them from drawing too much attention.</p>

<p><strong>Foundational Knowledge and Art Principles</strong></p>

<p>Teachers often provide information that makes sense later in practice. The course aims to give you foundational knowledge that remains relevant as you advance. While your understanding of art principles deepens over time, the basics remain constant. The artist continues to tackle the same issues from art school, focusing on fundamentals.</p>

<p><strong>Simplifying Color and Tone</strong></p>

<p>Initially, simplify subtle color variations to avoid complexity. Avoid mixing every color variation, instead, focus on averages to maintain control. Keeping halftones lighter than they appear is an important rule. Use thinner paint in shadow areas, for smoother transitions.</p>

<p><strong>Brush Techniques and Edge Management</strong></p>

<p>Use appropriately sized brushes to maintain precision in value placement. Address edges early in the painting process, reflecting what you see. Softening edges is often necessary, while hardening them is rarely needed. Smaller brushes can help adjust values and soften edges in a painting.</p>

<p><strong>Background and Color Influence</strong></p>

<p>Establishing some background helps you understand the color influence on the subject. Mixing black, white, and yellow ocher creates a grayish dark for the background. Color choices can be guided by intuition, as color is imprecise and varied.</p>

<p><strong>Experimentation and Intuition in Painting</strong></p>

<p>You can experiment with colors and values in painting, even if others don't see it. Sometimes, adding unexpected colors can feel right if the values are correct. Painting can involve using unconventional tools, like fingers, for certain effects.</p>

<p><strong>Capturing the Essence of the Subject</strong></p>

<p>Recognizing when a painting starts to capture the essence of a person is a key moment. Continue working on a painting until you feel you've captured something about the subject. Adjusting shadows and light involves warming up and lightening areas with specific colors.</p>

<p><strong>Balancing Light and Shadow</strong></p>

<p>Painting involves a balance between light and shadow, often preferring more shadow initially. Darker values can be painted in as accents within shadows. Use larger brushes for painting big areas of shadow, especially in hair and heads. Focus on the shape and construction of the head rather than individual hair details.</p>

<p><strong>Practical Painting Considerations</strong></p>

<p>Pre-mixed colors can be used to maintain consistency in values. The average tone of a board can match the average flesh color, creating a seamless look. It's important to stay true to the subject's natural colors, like avoiding a gray forehead on a child. Lighten areas with a pool of light, blending them with surrounding tones.</p>

<p>Taking breaks during painting is crucial for assessing progress and avoiding fatigue. Standing while painting is common, but sitting can be more comfortable for longer sessions. Breaks help maintain patience and prevent rushing through the painting process.</p>

<p><strong>Experimentation and Advanced Techniques</strong></p>

<p>Different painting techniques are valid, and experimenting with them can be enlightening. Advanced techniques can offer more detail and a different perspective on the canvas. The process is expedited because there is no need to revisit and redo tasks extensively.</p>
