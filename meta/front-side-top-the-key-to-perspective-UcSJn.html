<p>You've learned about <strong>one-point perspective</strong>. Starting from zero, you made one simple point, a vanishing point. This introduced the law that <strong>each set of parallel lines that recedes goes to a vanishing point</strong>.</p>

<p>But what happens when there are <strong>two sets of lines</strong> going away from us? Imagine stepping off the railroad track: one set of lines goes away to the right, and one to the left. <strong>Each set would have its own vanishing point</strong>.</p>

<p>Sometimes, when looking <strong>up</strong> at something or <strong>down</strong> at it, the lines going up or down also recede. That's <strong>three sets of lines</strong> going away from our face, based on the <strong>three sets of right-angled lines on a box</strong>. Understanding where these lines meet exactly is a problem we'll solve soon.</p>

<p>It's important to realize that <strong>three sets of lines and their vanishing points exist</strong>, and not everything in the world lines up neatly.</p>

<h2>Multiple Vanishing Points</h2>

<p>It's easy to label a picture as one-point, two-point, or three-point perspective if everything lines up just right. But what if it doesn't? Can a picture be in one-point and two-point perspective at the same time? What about images with <strong>multiple vanishing points</strong>?</p>

<p>Let's start with a simple aligned world, whether we're outside or inside. This world has <strong>width, height, and depth</strong>, three dimensions, which we'll label as letters <strong>x, y, and z</strong>. Here's the big deal, these dimensions can be in <strong>different positions</strong> compared to each other and compared to the room.</p>

<p>This explains why you might wonder how it can be two points and one point in the same picture. <strong>An environment may be viewed in one perspective, and objects within it may be in another</strong>.</p>

<h2>The Three Dimensions: Width, Depth, Height</h2>

<p>Every object in this world has <strong>width</strong> (left-right), <strong>height</strong> (up-down), and <strong>depth</strong> (front-back), the three axes of our beloved three-dimensional world.</p>

<p>To draw these dimensions in three-dimensional perspective, we first study each of them <strong>out of perspective</strong>, hence, this lesson.</p>

<h3>Orthographic Views Explained</h3>

<h4>The Front View</h4>

<p>The <strong>front view</strong> shows <strong>width and height</strong>. In an ortho, we don't lift our eye above to see a top plane or below to see a bottom plane, we look straight at depth.</p>

<h4>The Side View</h4>

<p>The <strong>side view</strong> shows <strong>height and depth</strong>. We're looking directly at width. Look how nicely they line up in orthos.</p>

<h4>The Top View</h4>

<p>The <strong>top view</strong> shows <strong>width and depth</strong>. We're looking directly at height. It lines up with the front view.</p>

<p>We assume:

- The back and front look alike unless they don't.

- Each side mirrors the other, assuming symmetry.

- The top and bottom are the same unless they aren't.</p>

<p>So, we may need six views for some objects, but an object like this probably only needs three views to show how it's shaped from all angles.</p>

<h3>Importance of Multiple Views</h3>

<p>If we didn't know what a teapot looked like and only had a <strong>side view</strong>, we might guess it's shaped like this:</p>

<p><img alt="Side view guess" src="side-view-guess.png" /></p>

<p>And if we only had a <strong>top view</strong>, how would we know it's not shaped like this?</p>

<p><img alt="Top view guess" src="top-view-guess.png" /></p>

<p>But with <strong>side and top views</strong>, we have enough information to estimate an oblique view when we learn how.</p>

<p>Just as the side view makes a sagittal section, the front view could make a coronal section. We use ortho knowledge to draw in perspective. This is why character designers draw <strong>turnarounds</strong> to build characters to animate. It allows a character designer to decide on proportions and lay them out clearly.</p>

<p>It's a basic drawing skill to <strong>draw around a character</strong>.</p>

<h2>How Orthographic Views Relate to Perspective Drawing</h2>

<p>Let's review with a monster.</p>

<ul>

<li>The <strong>front view</strong> shows <strong>width and height</strong>. Who knows how deep?</li>

<li>The <strong>top view</strong> knows. This view shows <strong>depth and width</strong>. Who knows how tall?</li>

<li>The <strong>front view</strong> does.</li>

<li>The same thing goes on between the front and side, but with another mystery axis.</li>

</ul>

<p>The <strong>side view</strong> shows <strong>height and depth</strong> but doesn't know how wide, which the other two views do.</p>

<p>If you're a beginner and the relationship between these three views seems like a lot to learn, it's all you need to learn for now. You'll be glad you did when we move on. This understanding allows you to draw in one, two, or three-point perspectives accurately.</p>

<h2>The Ortho Law</h2>

<p><strong>Every front and top view will line up on the widths. Every front and side view will line up on the heights.</strong></p>

<p>Remember why this came about? This simplifies going from paper to space, drawings to objects. But we're going to work in the opposite direction, <strong>space to paper</strong>.</p>

<h2>Project: Drawing Orthographic Views</h2>

<p>Let's do a project to get the idea, a project in <strong>no-point perspective</strong>.</p>

<p>Return to the object you chose for your form study. <strong>Draw it from top, side, and front</strong>, proportioned as truly as you can. It helps to not be too close, put it away from your face.</p>

<p>You may want to do a little pre-planning for how it will best fit on the page, keeping in mind our principle:</p>

<ul>

<li>If a top view swivels 90 degrees to show its front, it will all line up, the <strong>widths won't change</strong>.</li>

<li>If the front view swivels 90 degrees to the side, the <strong>height lines will stay the same</strong>.</li>

</ul>

<p>Now you have <strong>orthos</strong>. They will force you to notice <strong>proportion</strong>. This will help you to <strong>eyeball your three-quarter views</strong>, and it will make drawing in two and three-point perspective more logical and figureoutable.</p>

<p>You can use instruments or try it freehand. <strong>I recommend both</strong>:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Instruments</strong> get the lines precise on your paper - that's <strong>product</strong>.</li>

<li><strong>Freehand</strong> gets the idea deep in your brain if you do it a lot, that's <strong>process</strong>.</li>

</ul>

<p>This builds your ability to <strong>imagine in three dimensions</strong>.</p>

<p>If you're feeling enlightened and that this makes sense from just watching, remember that it takes time and doing it to heighten awareness of space-to-paper relationships, as well as paper-to-space solutions. <strong>Space to paper, paper to space - that's what perspective's all about</strong>.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p>In the next lesson, we'll learn about tipping these axes in space from <strong>ortho to 3D</strong>, preparing to sketch any object freehand. See you in the next lesson!</p>
