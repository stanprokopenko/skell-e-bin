<h2>Setting Goals</h2>

<p>You want to improve at figure drawing (or any skill), by setting clear, personal goals. Avoid treating your goals like someone else’s shopping list. Identify what <strong>you</strong> truly want. For example, if you want to master figure drawing, define what that means for you, your <strong>version</strong> of better.</p>

<h2>Traditional Approach vs. High Performance</h2>

<p>A typical approach is:

• You pick a goal.<br />

• You create a plan.<br />

• You take action (if you do).  </p>

<p>You might stick with it for a while, but many times you lose momentum or end up following someone else’s goal. High performers follow a similar structure but with a <strong>key difference</strong>: they pay attention at every step and <strong>refine</strong> their plan as they go. This refinement keeps the process creative and personalized.</p>

<h2>The Power of Paying Attention</h2>

<p>You’re designed to <strong>conserve energy</strong> by forming habits. That often means you stop noticing what you do each day. High performers stay alert to what’s working and what isn’t. They also rely on coaches, peers, and experts to see areas for improvement. Paying attention means asking questions like:<br />

• What went well in your last drawing session?<br />

• What didn’t?<br />

• How can you adjust?  </p>

<p>This awareness helps you <strong>grow faster</strong> and keep motivation high.</p>

<h2>Act Fast and Refine</h2>

<p>Instead of waiting to start, high performers take <strong>fast action</strong> on good-enough goals. As soon as you act, you get data: results that tell you what needs to change. Then you revise your goals and plan based on that feedback. This repeated cycle of action and attention creates <strong>steady improvement</strong> over time.</p>

<h2>The 80-20 Focus</h2>

<p>Out of every list of things you must learn, about <strong>20%</strong> of the tasks will move you <strong>80%</strong> of the way to success. In figure drawing, three core skills often have the biggest impact:<br />

1. <strong>Structure</strong> (the underlying architecture of the figure)<br />

2. <strong>Gesture</strong> (the energy and fluidity of the pose)<br />

3. <strong>Value</strong> (light and shadow to create form)  </p>

<p>Spend <strong>80%</strong> of your working time on these major skills and the remaining <strong>20%</strong> on supporting areas like perspective, anatomy details, or color theory. That focus keeps you moving forward efficiently.</p>

<h2>The Cycle of Improvement</h2>

<p>The best in the world never settle for a single round of learning. They follow a <strong>fortunate circle</strong>:

1. Make a goal.<br />

2. Act on it quickly.<br />

3. Observe the results and pay attention.<br />

4. Adjust and refine the plan.<br />

5. Repeat the cycle.  </p>

<p>This consistent process brings steady growth, keeps you motivated, and helps you become a better artist each time you draw.</p>

<p>When you aim to succeed in figure drawing or any skill, focus on <strong>personal</strong> goals, take <strong>fast action</strong>, pay <strong>close attention</strong>, and apply the <strong>80-20 rule</strong>. By refining and revisiting each step, you’ll see continual progress and stay enthusiastic about your artistic journey.</p>
