<h2>The Importance of Value Relationships</h2>

<p>When drawing, focus on <strong>value relationships</strong> rather than isolated values. Surrounding values <strong>affect how we perceive</strong> a particular value.</p>

<p>For example, two identical squares can appear different due to their surroundings. One seems lighter, the other darker, but they're the <strong>same value</strong>. This shows how <strong>context influences perception</strong>.</p>

<h2>Optical Illusions and Perception</h2>

<p>The <strong>checkerboard illusion</strong> demonstrates this effect. Square A looks darker than square B, but they're <strong>identical in value</strong>. This occurs because our brain considers <strong>local value plus lighting conditions</strong>. A white square in shadow can match the value of a black square in light.</p>

<p>Our brains have <strong>expectations</strong> that trick our perception. We assume a white square is always lighter than a black one. Even when aware of the illusion, it's hard to see the true values.</p>

<h2>Overriding Automatic Labels</h2>

<p>Override your brain's automatic labeling. Instead of thinking, "This is a white square, so it's white," focus on the <strong>actual values</strong> resulting from <strong>local value and lighting</strong>.</p>

<p>A common mistake is making the <strong>white of the eye literally white</strong>, which looks unnatural. Remember, the eye is a 3D form, and its value depends on the light's angle.</p>

<h2>Avoiding Tunnel Vision</h2>

<p><strong>Tunnel vision</strong> happens when you focus too much on one area, causing value distortions. To avoid this, <strong>change your perspective</strong>:</p>

<ul>

<li>Flip your drawing</li>

<li>Use a mirror</li>

<li>Tilt your head or drawing</li>

<li>Lean back and <strong>squint</strong></li>

</ul>

<p>Regularly <strong>step back</strong> from your work. Squinting helps you see <strong>overall value relationships</strong> and maintain correct shadow values.</p>

<h2>The Power of Squinting</h2>

<p><strong>Squinting</strong> simplifies the image, blurring details and grouping values. It helps identify <strong>primary</strong> and key <strong>secondary forms</strong>. Squint more during initial stages to establish major values, and less when adding details.</p>

<h2>Using Digital Tools Wisely</h2>

<p>Photoshop's <strong>median noise removal filter</strong> can simulate squinting by simplifying values while keeping edges sharp. Use it as a <strong>training tool</strong> to improve your ability to see value groups.</p>

<p>However, aim to develop this skill <strong>intuitively</strong>, without relying on software.</p>

<h2>Practice Makes Perfect</h2>

<p>Seeing <strong>true values</strong> over assumed ones comes with practice. As you draw more, you'll train your eyes to <strong>override preconceptions</strong> and perceive values accurately. This enhances your ability to create drawings that effectively depict light, shadow, and form.</p>
