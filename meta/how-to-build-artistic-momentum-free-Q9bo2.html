<h2>What's in Premium?</h2>

<p>In this lesson, you’ll learn practical methods to overcome creative resistance and build momentum in your art practice. We cover giving yourself permission to be bad, recognizing art as a stack of overlapping skills, chunking large tasks into smaller steps, and using visual cues to stay motivated. You’ll also discover how a supportive community can strengthen your resolve, how to address weaknesses safely, and how to balance practice with just enough challenge to keep stress manageable.</p>

<p>These strategies simplify your learning path, foster consistent progress, and help you transform weaknesses into strengths at a comfortable pace.</p>
