<h2>Preparing for Painting</h2>

<p>Before you start painting, it's important to prepare your workspace and materials. Begin by spraying your drawing with a <strong>fixative</strong> and let it sit overnight. This step helps to set the drawing and avoid any fumes while you work. Pre-mixing your colors on the palette is crucial for maintaining consistency throughout your painting process. This preparation helps you avoid frequent interruptions to mix colors while you're in the flow of painting.</p>

<h2>Tools and Materials</h2>

<p>To efficiently manage your paint mixtures, use small cups, which you can easily find at a dollar store. These cups are perfect for storing your pre-mixed colors. Make sure to <strong>label each cup</strong> to keep track of the different mixtures you create. This organization will save you time and help maintain the consistency of your colors.</p>

<h2>Mixing Colors</h2>

<p>When mixing colors, plan to create an <strong>average light</strong>, <strong>average dark</strong>, <strong>half tone</strong>, and possibly a <strong>reflected light</strong> for shadows. This approach is especially useful for large paintings where maintaining a consistent color, such as for a dress, is important. </p>

<h2>Understanding Local Color</h2>

<p><strong>Local color</strong> refers to the inherent color of an object. When mixing your paints, aim to blend the average color of the local color with the effects of light. This understanding will help you achieve a more realistic and cohesive look in your painting.</p>

<h2>Learning by Doing</h2>

<p>As a beginner, it's essential to focus on <strong>learning by doing</strong>. Practical experience will help you understand theories and techniques more effectively as you progress. Don't worry too much about getting everything perfect right away, practice is key.</p>

<h2>Limited Palette</h2>

<p>Using a <strong>limited palette</strong> can yield beautiful results. For this process, you will use alizarin crimson, yellow ocher, pale black, and white. Even though these are not pure colors, they can create a subdued and harmonious palette for your painting.</p>

<h2>Mixing Flesh Tones</h2>

<p>When mixing flesh tones, focus on creating a <strong>mean average flesh tone</strong>. Use large tubes of paint to mix batches, which allows for consistency and ease of use. Alizarin crimson is a great choice because it doesn't dry quickly, enabling you to reuse it over several days.</p>

<h2>Balancing Colors</h2>

<p>Mixing colors involves balancing <strong>cooler and warmer colors</strong>. The exact proportions aren't as crucial as getting the values right. Values, or the lightness and darkness of a color, are more important than the color itself. This balance will help you create a realistic form through light.</p>

<h2>Adjusting Mixtures</h2>

<p>Avoid making your mixtures appear as if they are in direct sunlight. Use black and alizarin to adjust the warmth of your colors. Be mindful that adding black can shift the mixture towards a greenish effect if yellow ocher is dominant. Adjust with more alizarin to achieve a redder flesh color without using white.</p>

<h2>Testing and Adjusting</h2>

<p>Test your mixtures by painting on the palette to see how they work together. This process involves <strong>trial and error</strong>, adjusting mixtures until you are satisfied with the results. Clean your palette knife regularly to avoid mixing shadow colors with light mixtures.</p>

<h2>Shadows and Light</h2>

<p>The light on your subject's face should be <strong>neutral</strong>, not too warm or cool. Avoid overly cool shadows, as they can make a person look lifeless. Shadows should not be too blue, instead, warm them up with alizarin crimson and yellow ocher to maintain a lifelike appearance.</p>

<h2>Intuitive Mixing</h2>

<p>Mixing paint is an <strong>intuitive and personal process</strong>. While there are guidelines, it's important to trust your instincts and adjust as needed. Focus on values to create form through light, rather than just relying on colorful, impressionistic paintings.</p>

<h2>Finalizing Mixtures</h2>

<p>Ensure that your average mixture is consistent and doesn't create too stark a contrast with the shadows. Having a large batch of the average mixture acts as a "home button," allowing you to return to a starting point if needed. Test your mixtures before finalizing decisions to ensure they meet your expectations.</p>
