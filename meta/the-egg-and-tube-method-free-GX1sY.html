<h2>What's in Premium?</h2>

<p>Learn to build shoulders and torsos from both front and profile views by focusing on “corners” for sharp bends and “S-curves” for smoother transitions. Discover how to place a clear shoulder line and center line, simplify forms using basic shapes, and separate arms from the torso with overlapping lines or small L-shaped corners. You’ll also get tips on quick sketch strategies and see how these principles apply to both male and female bodies.</p>
