<p><strong>Drawing Beta Ray Bill</strong></p>

<p>I'm going to tackle Beta Ray Bill because it's what I'm known for in the Marvel Universe. I start in pencil because Beta Ray Bill is still a challenge to draw. You'd think I'd be really awesome at drawing him by now. I still always draw his eyes too high. I wasn't into him as a kid because I didn't have access to the old 80s comics. It wasn't until after college and working in comics for a while that I got into Beta Ray Bill.</p>

<p><strong>Discovering Beta Ray Bill</strong></p>

<p>I was a big anime and manga guy for a long time and still am. Eventually, I wanted to see different stuff and read Walt Simonson's Thor run. I always kind of knew about Beta Ray Bill and loved the character but never read his origin story. His story is somber and epic in scope, which I thought was cool.</p>

<p><strong>Walt Simonson's Influence</strong></p>

<p>I got the Thor artist edition and loved seeing Walt Simonson's lines. Simonson was trying to hit a deadline but still made everything look good. Some old comics aren't fun to read because they're talky, but Simonson's work is really good. Simonson was a great writer and artist, making his work universal and good. I don't remember exactly when Beta Ray Bill shows up, but the issue of him smashing the Thor logo is a great place to start. The artist edition is expensive and takes up space, but it's the best way to read it for the first time in black and white. Simonson didn't let the colorist do any of the work for him; it all reads well in black and white. Older comics sometimes leave things out in black and white, but Simonson took no shortcuts.</p>

<p><strong>The Unique Aspects of Comics</strong></p>

<p>Comics can be a solitary game, which can be lonely, but it's artistically freeing. The only person that can get in the way of me telling stories is me. I love being able to write and draw my own stuff and having agency over my career and stories. In other mediums like movies, TV shows, and video games, you need more people, which makes it harder to get things done. Collaboration is amazing but harder to coordinate and takes more work. With comics, there's only one person involved, which is incredible and special. There's no budget in comics; you can draw anything you imagine without constraints. All you need is time and a willingness to get better. Comics equalize storytelling because you don't need a big corporation's approval. The only thing getting in the way is you, and that's special.</p>
