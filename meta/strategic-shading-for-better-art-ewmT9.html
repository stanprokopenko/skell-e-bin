<h2>Determining the Light Source</h2>

<p>I'm moving on to the light and shadow portion of my artwork. The first step is to determine where the <strong>light source</strong> is coming from. I've decided that the light will come from the top left, hitting my main character's face. This ensures that the <strong>focal point</strong> is well-lit and draws the viewer's attention.</p>

<p>When deciding where the light should be, place it in a way that highlights what you're supposed to look at. It's tempting to use cool effects like backlighting, but if it doesn't serve your main purpose, it can detract from the overall piece.</p>

<h2>Adding Shadows</h2>

<p>To implement the shading, I create a <strong>multiply layer</strong> and usually set it between 50% to 70% opacity. Starting at 70% makes it easier to see where I'm going, and I can dial it back if it's too intense. The <strong>color of the shadow</strong> is crucial because it tells the viewer about the quality of the light.</p>

<h2>Choosing Shadow Colors</h2>

<p>Choosing the right shadow color depends on the mood and setting:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Cool shadows</strong> (blues) imply midday lighting or, if darker, nighttime.</li>

<li><strong>Warm shadows</strong> (warm colors) convey a sunny, hot day or an afternoon with low light.</li>

</ul>

<p>You can adjust the shadow color easily since it's on a separate layer. For my piece, I'm going with a blue daytime look to match the existing palette.</p>

<h2>Shading Techniques</h2>

<p>I use the same pen, a <strong>toothy inker</strong>, for shadows to add texture rather than clean-cut shadows. Texture adds visual interest and sets you up for adding gradients and glows later.</p>

<p>I start shading with the <strong>focal point</strong>, lighting it so all important parts are visible. I think about volumes and shapes, considering which planes are affected by light and which are not.</p>

<p>Be cautious not to <strong>over shade</strong>. Sometimes the charm is in the line work, and overdoing shadows can overpower the piece. Check if shading is covering important parts or making it harder to read.</p>

<h2>Form Shadows vs. Cast Shadows</h2>

<p>Understanding the difference between <strong>form shadows</strong> and <strong>cast shadows</strong> is important:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Form shadows</strong> occur where the form itself turns away from the light source.</li>

<li><strong>Cast shadows</strong> are shadows cast by an object blocking the light.</li>

</ul>

<p>For example, I might add the cast shadow of a character's arm onto their leg to add realism. Cast shadows can reveal the curvature of forms, enhancing the three-dimensional feel.</p>

<h2>Adjusting Shadows</h2>

<p>Don't be afraid to adjust your shadows if they compromise the main goal. If shading over the face makes it harder to read, you might need to adjust the light source or cheat the shadows slightly. It's about finding a balance between realism and clarity.</p>

<p>I often shade the most obscured places first, which helps me get a sense of how the shaded piece will look. This gives flexibility to adjust the light source direction if needed.</p>

<h2>Adding Texture and Detail</h2>

<p>Shading can also be used to add <strong>texture</strong> and guide the viewer's eye. On flat surfaces like the ground, I use shading to add value and move the viewer's eye towards the focal point.</p>

<p>When shading humans, being familiar with anatomy helps. Knowing where curves are allows for accurate form shadows. It's about solving simple problems over and over until it becomes second nature.</p>

<h2>Using Clipping Masks and Bounce Light</h2>

<p>I use <strong>clipping masks</strong> to color within the shadows. This allows me to brighten parts of the shadow or add <strong>bounce light</strong> where light is reflected back onto the object. It's especially useful for softening shadows or emphasizing certain areas.</p>

<p>By adjusting the intensity and color of shadows, I can affect the emotional feel of the piece. Subtle adjustments can make it feel like a different time of day or set a specific mood.</p>

<p>Remember that sometimes overworking a piece can be counterproductive. The most important aspect is whether the artwork makes the viewer feel something. Technical accuracy is important, but the <strong>story and emotion are paramount</strong>.</p>

<p>Now that I've finished the shading portion, I'm ready to move on to lighting.</p>
