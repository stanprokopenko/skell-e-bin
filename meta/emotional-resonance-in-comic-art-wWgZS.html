<h2>Getting Started in Comics</h2>

<p>I've been working with Marvel for about 40 years now, and I started on <strong>Alpha Flight</strong>, <strong>Longshot</strong>, and <strong>Punisher</strong>. Then I graduated to the X-Books, <strong>Uncanny X-Men</strong>, <strong>X-Factor</strong>, <strong>X-Force</strong>, and eventually helped form <strong>Image Comics</strong>. Now, I'm mostly doing covers.</p>

<p>As a kid, I loved film. I aspired to get into film school but couldn't afford it. My cousin introduced me to <strong>San Diego Comic-Con</strong>, where I was lucky enough to meet Karl Potts, a senior editor at Marvel. He saw potential in me and took the time to mentor me, which was rare.</p>

<h2>The Importance of Mentorship</h2>

<p>Karl didn't just tell me to come back next year, he got my number and checked in monthly for new samples. One day, I received a FedEx package from Marvel, it was the book <strong>"The Five C's of Cinematography"</strong>. Karl said, "Study this, and once you figure it out, I'll give you a job." I took the challenge and learned storytelling.</p>

<h2>Transitioning Roles in the Industry</h2>

<p>I always wanted to be a penciler, the top dog. But I learned that I couldn't just draw pretty pictures, I had to tell a story. While studying storytelling, I started <strong>inking</strong> to help other artists meet deadlines. As I improved, I began <strong>penciling</strong> and even <strong>writing</strong>. I created characters like <strong>Bishop</strong>. At Image, we had to learn everything, production, retail, distribution, and promotion. I even helped pioneer the use of <strong>Photoshop in comics</strong>.</p>

<h2>Embracing All Aspects of Art</h2>

<p>Art is a vast field, encompassing everything from drawing to film to animation. If you have <strong>talent</strong> and <strong>drive</strong>, you can venture into different areas. For aspiring artists, it's crucial to recognize your talent and seek validation. When a professional says, "Hey, you're pretty good," that confidence boost can propel you forward.</p>

<h2>Focusing on <strong>Focus</strong></h2>

<p>In the comics industry, we work under tight deadlines. When creating a scene, it's essential to choose a <strong>focal point</strong>. For example, if <strong>Cyclops</strong> is the leader barking orders, I direct everything towards him. Characters' gestures, smoke, even background elements all point back to the focal point. It's all about direction and focus to guide the reader's eye.</p>

<h2>Combining Digital and Traditional Techniques</h2>

<p>I'm proud to be a geek. I embraced digital tools early on, buying my first computer in 1989 for <strong>ray tracing</strong> and model building. While I've worked digitally, efficiency is key. I do all my <strong>layouts digitally</strong>, working out the anatomy until it is perfect. Then I print the blue line onto paper, and ink it traditionally. This method allows me to experiment without fear, if I make a mistake, I can print another copy. The <strong>freedom</strong> this provides enhances creativity.</p>

<h2>Creating Meaningful Art</h2>

<p>Over the years, my approach to covers has changed. Nowadays, covers are prime real estate, and artists are often brought in without context. But I believe in telling a <strong>story</strong>, even in a single image. I've drawn <strong>Wolverine</strong> countless times, but by infusing emotion and backstory, each drawing becomes new and exciting.</p>

<p>One of my proudest works is a cover featuring <strong>Storm</strong>. My editor, Suzanne Gaffney, mentioned that Storm was seen as emotionless. We decided to show her vulnerable side, a half-shot of Storm <strong>crying in the rain</strong>. I didn't anticipate the impact it would have. People from all walks of life connected with that image, as they saw themselves in it. That, to me, is what real art is about, creating something that resonates beyond its original intent.</p>
