<p>Let's take a close look at Hiroshi Yoshida's <strong>"Rapids"</strong>. Advance warning: this is going to be a deep dive into one picture with me talking.</p>

<h2>The Arrangement of Water Shapes</h2>

<p>Notice how Yoshida is aware that water arranges itself into <strong>roundish shapes</strong> if you were to look <strong>down</strong> on them. But when we look <strong>along</strong> them, like we do here, they compress into <strong>ellipses</strong>. We will study ellipses.</p>

<h2>The Top Plane of the Waterfall</h2>

<p>Observe how he understands the <strong>top plane</strong> of the waterfall as a plane, with some parts higher than others. See how the plane breaks and forms a <strong>sloping front plane</strong> with a little curve to it.</p>

<h2>Rhythm in Composition</h2>

<p>Look at how he arranges a kind of <strong>rhythm</strong> of light areas with dark patches in them, then dark areas, and then light areas with dark patches again. That's <strong>composition</strong>, not perspective. But he does not sacrifice perspective to achieve that beautiful rhythm.</p>

<h2>Use of Perspective and Cross Contours</h2>

<p>He maintains perspective by making almost all of these lines <strong>cross contours</strong>. Even this portion of the waterfall he treats as part of an <strong>interior cylinder</strong>.</p>

<h2>The Cylinder Effect in Waterfall Lines</h2>

<p>He even makes the lines crowd together at the edges, the way that happens on the inside of a cylinder, and spread out as they face toward us.</p>

<h2>Size and Structure of Froth and Wavelets</h2>

<p>Look at how the <strong>froth and wavelets</strong> get smaller in their structures as they go away up here compared to the larger conglomerate shapes they make down here.</p>

<h2>Appreciation of Art and Perspective Mastery</h2>

<p>I almost apologize for making these statements because, to me, this piece is not meant to be analyzed. It is meant to be enjoyed for its beauty. But part of what we're doing here is understanding that one part of his ability to make such a remarkable picture was his ability to control that sense of convincingness in this water. It's like a cartoon, and yet it looks real.</p>

<p>I present this to you as an example of <strong>perspective mastery</strong>, an artist who knew perspective, an artist who used perspective. If you find images that you can understand in these terms and that showcase a skill that you want to develop in your own work, comb through them in the coming months as you study with me to notice the use of perspective.</p>
