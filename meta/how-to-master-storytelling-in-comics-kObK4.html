<h2>Working in Oils in a Digital Age</h2>

<p>I mostly work in <strong>oils</strong>, which is uncommon today with many artists going digital. While I appreciate the new effects in <strong>mixed media</strong>, I value the traditional approach. Working in <strong>black and white</strong> can be faster since it removes some problem-solving aspects.</p>

<h2>My Illustration Process</h2>

<p>My process follows a standard academic approach:</p>

<ol>

<li><strong>Thumbnails</strong>: Create multiple thumbnails focusing on design and composition.</li>

<li><strong>Reference Gathering</strong>: Collect necessary references.</li>

<li><strong>Refinement</strong>: Flesh out the chosen thumbnail.</li>

<li><strong>Color Comps</strong>: Do color compositions if needed.</li>

<li><strong>Final Piece</strong>: Finish with minimal guesswork.</li>

</ol>

<p>Most illustrators work similarly, adjusting steps based on deadlines.</p>

<h2>Dealing with Deadlines</h2>

<p>Deadlines vary greatly. Sometimes a cover is due in a week, other times, I have months. The fastest I've done a cover is in a week, but it's not sustainable. Timelines depend on the type of cover and scheduling.</p>

<h2>My Love for Comics</h2>

<p>I've loved comics since childhood. An <strong>X-Men annual drawn by Art Adams</strong>, featuring Storm with Thor's hammer, inspired me to draw. That comic made me identify as an artist.</p>

<h2>Favorite Comics and Characters</h2>

<p>My favorite storylines are <strong>"Mutant Massacre"</strong> and <strong>"Inferno"</strong> from the X-Men. I love <strong>Wolverine</strong> and <strong>Spider-Man</strong>, but also have a fondness for <strong>Longshot</strong> and the villain <strong>Mojo</strong>.</p>

<h2>The Magic of Comics Storytelling</h2>

<p>Great comics create the illusion of movement and pacing. The artists trick my brain into seeing a movie from still images, a testament to their storytelling skills.</p>

<h2>Cinematic Influences</h2>

<p>I bring a <strong>cinematic approach</strong> to my art, using lighting techniques, camera placement, and staging from films. Directors like <strong>Spielberg</strong> and <strong>Hitchcock</strong> inspire me. I aim to evoke emotions in viewers similar to those elicited by movies.</p>

<h2>Developing Ideas</h2>

<p>I <strong>observe</strong> the world around me, light hitting a form, mist on the ground, and mix these observations with imagination to create authentic images in a fictional world.</p>

<h2>Breaking into Comics</h2>

<p>At Comic-Con, a small company gave me a chance to paint a variant cover. Later, a friend connected me with Marvel. After showing my work, I became a regular cover artist for one of their series.</p>

<h2>Advice for Aspiring Artists</h2>

<p><strong>Learn to draw.</strong> Master the <strong>fundamentals</strong>, have a <strong>passion</strong> for art, and develop a <strong>unique creative vision</strong>. These are essential for a lasting career.</p>

<h2>Overcoming Challenges</h2>

<p>My biggest challenges were <strong>speed</strong> and <strong>originality</strong>. Finding my unique voice and producing quality work under tight deadlines is vital.</p>

<h2>Storytelling in Art</h2>

<p><strong>Storytelling</strong> is key. I study artists like <strong>Alex Ross</strong>, <strong>Norman Rockwell</strong>, and others to improve. You become a storyteller by telling stories and learning from masters.</p>

<h2>Dealing with Self-Doubt</h2>

<p>I struggle with <strong>self-doubt</strong>. I focus on the work at hand and avoid worrying about others' opinions until it is finished. Objective judgments are made during the process, subjective ones come after.</p>

<h2>Staying Motivated</h2>

<p><strong>Fatigue</strong> is the only hindrance to my motivation. I always want to draw, even on days off. I have more motivation than time.</p>

<h2>Challenges in Professional Art</h2>

<p><strong>Deadlines</strong> are tough. Achieving near perfection within constraints is challenging. It's also hard when I have to decline jobs I want due to time.</p>

<h2>Dealing with Burnout</h2>

<p>I've faced <strong>burnout</strong> from excessive work. As a professional, you must push through and fulfill commitments. Sometimes, taking necessary breaks is crucial.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p>You rarely achieve 100%. Life and deadlines interfere. But completing a piece and seeing positive reactions is immensely rewarding. Remember, art is a job, and delivering quality work on schedule is essential.</p>
