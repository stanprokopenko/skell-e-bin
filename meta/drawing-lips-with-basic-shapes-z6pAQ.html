<p>In this session, I'll share my process for gesture drawing mouths, focusing on different lip types and shapes from various references. By exploring these variations, we'll enhance our understanding of how to depict lips with depth and realism.</p>

<h2>Starting with the Denture Sphere</h2>

<p>I begin by drawing an <strong>elongated sphere</strong> or egg shape to represent the <strong>denture sphere</strong> where the teeth reside. This reminds me that lips <strong>wrap around</strong> this rounded form and aren't flat surfaces.</p>

<h2>Indicating the Corners and Lip Line</h2>

<p>Next, I <strong>indicate the corners of the mouth</strong>, and connect them with a straight line. Paying attention to the <strong>tilt of the lip line</strong> is crucial, it sets the mood and expression of the mouth.</p>

<h2>Establishing Key Features</h2>

<p>I establish the <strong>lip line</strong> where the lips meet and mark the <strong>center of the upper lip</strong>. This acts as a midline to help keep the features symmetrical. Then, I sketch the <strong>cupid's bow</strong>, noting how it differs among individuals.</p>

<h2>Adding Depth and Shadows</h2>

<p>To convey depth, I rough in the <strong>middle line of the lower lip</strong> and imagine the <strong>upside-down keystone shape</strong> below it, adding value to suggest form. I place the <strong>upper lip in shadow</strong> and indicate the <strong>donut hole indentation</strong> at the corners of the mouth.</p>

<h2>Simplifying Facial Hair</h2>

<p>When dealing with features like a goatee, I <strong>simplify the overall silhouette</strong> before adding details. Instead of drawing individual hairs, I represent them as <strong>clumps</strong> to focus on the form and texture.</p>

<h2>Incorporating the Nose and Nasolabial Folds</h2>

<p>I establish the <strong>septum</strong>, leading up to the base of the nose, and use horizontal lines to find the <strong>base of the nostrils</strong>, matching the mouth's perspective. I block in the <strong>nasolabial folds</strong>, which are more pronounced in older or heavier models.</p>

<h2>Observing Overlaps and Planes</h2>

<p>Breaking up straight lines slightly suggests the <strong>middle tubercle</strong>, adding subtle variation. Observing <strong>overlaps</strong>, such as the upper lip over the lower lip or the lateral tubercle over the middle one, adds <strong>depth</strong> and realism to the drawing.</p>

<h2>Profile Views and Proportions</h2>

<p>In profile views, I note that lips have an <strong>overall slanted orientation</strong>, and the side of the mouth doesn't extend too far back. Remembering the flow of the mouth's shape, how it <strong>steps in and out</strong>, helps maintain accurate proportions.</p>

<h2>Reflecting on Different Models</h2>

<p>Drawing from various references enhances our understanding of lip structures:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Younger models</strong> may have <strong>fuller lips</strong> with pronounced tubercles.</li>

<li><strong>Older models</strong> might display more <strong>pronounced nasolabial folds</strong> and jowls due to age and weight.</li>

</ul>

<p>Recognizing these nuances is key to creating lifelike drawings.</p>

<h2>Moving Forward</h2>

<p>With these gestures complete, I'm excited to move on to a <strong>color render</strong> and eventually a <strong>full portrait</strong>. By applying these techniques, we'll bring together everything we've learned to create expressive and comprehensive drawings of the face.</p>
