<p>Welcome to the mouth chapter! In this lesson, we'll focus on the <strong>structure of the lips</strong> and how the mouth relates to the rest of the head. We'll dive into the anatomy, explore different perspectives, and apply our knowledge through studies and gestures.</p>

<h2>Overview of Sections</h2>

<ol>

<li><strong>Basic Shapes and Anatomy</strong>: A quick diagrammatic breakdown of the mouth's fundamental forms.</li>

<li><strong>3D Scan Studies</strong>: Applying our understanding to studies from <strong>Bodies in Motion</strong> scans, featuring various perspectives, mouth types, and lighting scenarios.</li>

<li><strong>Gesture Drawings</strong>: Creating gestures of lips from diverse models, highlighting different ethnicities and mouth types.</li>

<li><strong>Full Rendering</strong>: A comprehensive rendering of the lips, integrating everything we've learned.</li>

</ol>

<h2>Basic Anatomy and Placement</h2>

<h3>Structure and Placement Using the Loomis Method</h3>

<p>To understand the mouth's placement, we'll use the <strong>Loomis method</strong>:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Start with a Sphere</strong>: Represent the cranium with a simple sphere.</li>

<li><strong>Attach the Jaw</strong>: Gesture in the jawline below the sphere.</li>

<li><strong>Find the Brow Line</strong>: Cut the sphere in half to establish the brow line.</li>

<li><strong>Determine the Eye Line</strong>: Go a third of the way down between the brow line and the base of the sphere.</li>

<li><strong>Place the Nose</strong>: The base of the sphere typically indicates the base of the nose.</li>

<li><strong>Add the Ears and Neck</strong>: Roughly sketch in the ears and neck for context.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Placing the Mouth</h3>

<ul>

<li><strong>One-Third Rule</strong>: The mouth generally sits <strong>one-third of the way down</strong> from the base of the nose to the base of the chin.</li>

<li><strong>Vertical Alignment</strong>: If you draw a line straight up from the <strong>corners of the mouth</strong>, it often aligns with the <strong>center of the eyes or irises</strong>.</li>

<li><strong>Adjust for Accuracy</strong>: Feel free to adjust the mouth's width and height to ensure it feels proportionate.</li>

</ul>

<h2>The Lips: Key Features</h2>

<h3>The Philtrum and Cupid's Bow</h3>

<ul>

<li><strong>Philtrum</strong>: A <strong>short, stubby tie-shaped</strong> area below the nose that divides the upper lip. It feeds into the septum at the base of the nose.</li>

<li><strong>Cupid's Bow</strong>: Resembles a horizontally lying bow with a notch in the middle. It defines the upper contours of the upper lip.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Tubercles of the Lips</h3>

<ul>

<li><strong>Upper Lip</strong>: Consists of <strong>three masses (tubercles)</strong>:<ul>

<li>One <strong>heart-shaped tubercle</strong> in the middle.</li>

<li>Two <strong>smaller tubercles</strong> on each side, slightly overlapped by the middle one.</li>

</ul>

</li>

<li><strong>Lower Lip</strong>: Made up of <strong>two tubercles</strong> that form its fullness.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Corners of the Mouth</h3>

<ul>

<li>Think of them as <strong>donut shapes</strong> where planes converge into the "donut hole," creating <strong>pockets of occlusion</strong> (areas with little light).</li>

<li>These dark accents are crucial for defining the mouth, even from a distance.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Vermilion Border</h3>

<ul>

<li>The <strong>edges of the lips</strong> are known as the <strong>vermilion border</strong>.</li>

<li><strong>Upper Lip</strong>: More distinct due to the planar change.</li>

<li><strong>Lower Lip</strong>: Can be more subdued, especially if the lip color is close to the surrounding skin tone.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Nasolabial Folds and Surrounding Anatomy</h2>

<ul>

<li><strong>Nasolabial Fold</strong>: A crease that starts at the top of the wings of the nose and frames the mouth's muzzle.</li>

<li>Be cautious with these lines, making them too strong can add <strong>age</strong> to your character, especially in females.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Drawing the Mouth from Different Angles</h2>

<h3>Front View</h3>

<ul>

<li><strong>Symmetry</strong>: Use symmetry tools or guidelines to ensure balance.</li>

<li><strong>Lip Line Shape</strong>: Flatten the cupid's bow slightly to create the <strong>lip line</strong>.</li>

<li><strong>Overlapping Forms</strong>: Emphasize the overlap of the middle tubercle for depth.</li>

<li><strong>Shadowing</strong>: <ul>

<li>The <strong>upper lip</strong> is often in shadow due to its plane facing downward.</li>

<li>Use <strong>core shadows</strong> to define the fullness and roundness of the lips.</li>

<li><strong>Cast Shadows</strong>: Under the upper lip and below the lower lip's receding plane.</li>

</ul>

</li>

</ul>

<h3>Profile View</h3>

<ul>

<li><strong>Alignment</strong>:<ul>

<li>The <strong>corner of the mouth</strong> aligns with the <strong>front of the eyeball</strong>.</li>

<li>Avoid pulling the corner too far back, which can distort the profile.</li>

</ul>

</li>

<li><strong>Lip Proportions</strong>: The <strong>lower lip</strong> typically recedes back slightly more than the upper lip.</li>

<li><strong>Cupid's Bow and Philtrum</strong>:<ul>

<li>Visible in profile but subtler.</li>

<li>The philtrum appears as a gentle indentation below the septum.</li>

</ul>

</li>

<li><strong>Chin and Jawline</strong>: Consider the planes and how they relate to the lips.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Rendering Light and Shadow</h2>

<h3>Understanding Light Source</h3>

<ul>

<li><strong>Primary Light Source</strong>: Establish where the light is coming from (e.g., above and to the left).</li>

<li><strong>Planes and Angles</strong>: Determine which planes of the lips are facing the light and which are in shadow.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Values and Gradients</h3>

<ul>

<li><strong>Highlights</strong>: Found on planes directly facing the light.</li>

<li><strong>Halftones/Midtones</strong>: Transitional planes between light and shadow.</li>

<li><strong>Core Shadows</strong>: Darker areas where the form turns away from the light.</li>

<li><strong>Cast Shadows</strong>: Darkest areas where light is obstructed by another form (e.g., under the upper lip).</li>

</ul>

<h3>Maintaining Value Relationships</h3>

<ul>

<li><strong>Contrast</strong>: Keep a strong separation between lights and darks.</li>

<li><strong>Rule of Thumb</strong>: <strong>Never let your lightest darks be as light as your darkest lights</strong>.</li>

<li>This ensures clarity and readability from a distance.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Studying Different Mouth Types</h2>

<h3>Variations in Anatomy</h3>

<ul>

<li><strong>Underbites and Overbites</strong>: Note how the alignment of the jaws affects lip positioning.</li>

<li><strong>Age Factors</strong>:<ul>

<li><strong>Younger Lips</strong>: Fuller with more pronounced tubercles and cupid's bow.</li>

<li><strong>Older Lips</strong>: Thinner, with more wrinkles and less definition in the cupid's bow.</li>

</ul>

</li>

</ul>

<h3>Gesture Drawings</h3>

<ul>

<li>Focus on capturing the <strong>tilt</strong> and <strong>expression</strong> of the lips.</li>

<li>Use light and shadow to define forms quickly.</li>

<li>Emphasize unique features, such as pronounced nasolabial folds or distinctive lip shapes.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Tips for Effective Lip Drawing</h2>

<ul>

<li><strong>Overlap and Depth</strong>: Use overlapping lines to convey depth.</li>

<li><strong>Subtle Details</strong>: Small nuances like the philtrum's planes or the vermilion border add realism.</li>

<li><strong>Dark Accents</strong>: Utilize the corners of the mouth for contrast.</li>

<li><strong>Edge Variation</strong>: Soften or sharpen edges to indicate form changes.</li>

<li><strong>Practice Variety</strong>: Study different ages, ethnicities, and expressions to enhance your visual library.</li>

</ul>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p>Understanding the intricate structure of the lips and mouth is essential for creating realistic and expressive portraits. By studying the anatomy, practicing from various references, and paying close attention to light and shadow, you'll enhance your ability to depict this complex feature convincingly. Remember to observe closely, practice regularly, and embrace the unique characteristics that make each mouth distinct.</p>
