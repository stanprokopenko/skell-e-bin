<h2>Determining the Light Source</h2>

<p>I'm moving on to the <strong>light and shadow</strong> portion of my illustration. First, I need to determine where the <strong>light source</strong> is coming from. For this piece, I've decided the light is coming from the top left, hitting the main character's face. This way, the <strong>focal point</strong> is well-lit and clearly what you're supposed to look at.</p>

<p>When deciding where the light should be, place it in a way where the thing we're supposed to look at is lit the way we want it to be. Sometimes we get caught up with cool effects like being backlit or having intense light somewhere, but if that doesn't serve your purpose, you can run into trouble.</p>

<h2>Implementing Shading</h2>

<h3>Using Multiply Layers</h3>

<p>To implement the shading, I make a <strong>multiply layer</strong>. I usually turn it down to between 50% to 70% opacity. I might start with 70% because it's easier to see where I'm going, and then dial it back if it's too intense.</p>

<h3>Choosing the Right Shadow Color</h3>

<p>The <strong>color of the shadow</strong> is important because it tells the viewer the quality of the light. If it's an unnatural color, it means they're lit by an unnatural light source, like in a night scene or a cyberpunk vibe.</p>

<p>Decide what kind of shadow you want. Generally, it's going to be warm or cool:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Cool shadows</strong> (blues): Implies earlier in the day, midday lighting, or nighttime if it's darker blue.</li>

<li><strong>Warm shadows</strong> (reds, oranges): Implies it's hot and sunny, afternoon lighting, or a sunset look.</li>

</ul>

<p>You're not locked into the color you choose because it's all on one layer, and you can easily make adjustments. For now, I'm going to play into the palette I have so far and go for more of a blue daytime look.</p>

<h3>Pen Choices for Shading</h3>

<p>For the shadows, I tend to use the same pen, which is a <strong>toothy inker</strong>. When I use a really clean-cut shadow, it's kind of a lost opportunity. Having a little texture adds more visual interest. If you choose to add more gradients and glows, this will set you up to do more of that.</p>

<h2>Lighting the Focal Point</h2>

<p>It's important to start with your <strong>focal point</strong>, which in my case is the main character. Light them in a way where all the important parts are visible and highlight the things you want us to see. I'm imagining the light hitting from the top left, so all the shadows are on the other side.</p>

<h2>Approaches to Shading</h2>

<h3>Thinking in Volumes and Shapes</h3>

<p>This portion of the coloring is the most like drawing for me because my brain gets to think about <strong>volumes</strong> and <strong>shapes</strong> again, but now with the crutch of having something drawn already. I'm looking at what's there and deciding which planes are affected by the light and which are not. Sometimes it's ambiguous, but the more you do this, the easier it gets.</p>

<p>I can put on a podcast and zone out. I enjoy this stage a lot because it's fun to see the piece come into a <strong>3D space</strong>.</p>

<h3>Avoiding Over-Shading</h3>

<p>From experience, I know that sometimes I tend to <strong>over-shade</strong> things. By that, I mean the piece can lose some of its charm if it's over-shaded. Think about whether the shading is overpowering or if you're losing parts of the image that you needed to see. If shading over the face or silhouette makes it harder to read what's happening, you might need to dial it back.</p>

<h3>Different Techniques for Shading</h3>

<p>One approach is to overshade and then dial it back. For example, if a character is completely backlit, sometimes it's easier to shade everything first and then cut into it, carving out the light. This is more akin to what I'd view as the <strong>highlight stage</strong> of drawing.</p>

<h3>Adjusting Lighting for Readability</h3>

<p>Technically, it might make more sense for a character's face to be more in shadow, but because they're central to the piece, I need to light it in a way where the face gets enough light so the piece reads well. If your lighting decision compromises your main goal, you may need to adjust your light source.</p>

<h2>Understanding Shadows</h2>

<h3>Form Shadows vs. Cast Shadows</h3>

<p>When shading, I think about <strong>form shadows</strong> versus <strong>cast shadows</strong>.</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Form shadows</strong>: Where the form itself turns away from the light source.</li>

<li><strong>Cast shadows</strong>: Shadows that are cast by an object blocking the light.</li>

</ul>

<p>Knowing the difference helps you draw them more accurately. Form shadows tend to have more blending, showing the softness of the curvature. Cast shadows are generally sharper, but can be blurry depending on the light source.</p>

<h3>Cheating the Light Source</h3>

<p>If your lighting choice covers important elements in shadow, you might need to <strong>cheat</strong> the light source a bit. Adjusting the light so it still feels consistent but reveals the key parts of your illustration is acceptable. Most audiences won't notice these small adjustments.</p>

<h3>Starting with Occluded Areas</h3>

<p>When shading, I shade the most occluded places first. This allows me to get a sense of what the shaded piece will look like. It also gives me flexibility to decide where I want the light to be. These areas are always in shadow, so it's a safe place to start.</p>

<h3>Using Cast Shadows for Interest</h3>

<p>I like to think about <strong>cast shadows</strong> from objects, like having the shadow of a character's arm onto their leg. This can add interesting shapes and reveal the geometry of forms. I'm not overly scientific with the accuracy, it's close enough to convince most audiences.</p>

<h2>Adding Texture and Interest</h2>

<p>In addition to light and shadow affecting objects in the scene, I use shading to add <strong>texture</strong> to the ground or other surfaces. Shading can create value that moves the viewer's eye where I want them to go. It's an opportunity to suggest textures or details without drawing them all in.</p>

<h2>Advanced Techniques</h2>

<h3>Using Clipping Masks and Bounce Light</h3>

<p>I use a <strong>clipping mask</strong> to color within the shadow. By creating a clipping mask on top of the shadow layer, I can add brighter colors within the shadow areas. This allows me to create <strong>bounce light</strong>, where light reflects off surfaces and softly illuminates shadowed areas.</p>

<p>This technique can brighten up areas in shadow, making them pop without changing the overall lighting. It's useful for bringing attention to focal points or adding subtle lighting effects.</p>

<h3>Tweaking Shadows and Colors</h3>

<p>At this stage, I might play with the layers and adjust the colors and opacities. I can make the shadows more intense or subtle, depending on the effect I want. Changing the color of the shadows can also significantly alter the mood of the piece.</p>

<p>I generally like to start with a more intense color and then dial it back if it's too much. Having it more intense allows me to see areas where I might have missed coloring within the lines or where the shadow work isn't accurate.</p>

<h3>Adding Secondary Occluded Shadows</h3>

<p>To add more depth, I might add a <strong>secondary occluded shadow</strong> pass. This is an additional layer of shading that brings out the darkest areas. It's important to be sparing with this, as it's easy to overdo it. Use it to create separation between elements and to push certain areas back.</p>

<p>This secondary shading helps in areas that need to be darker than the rest, making it feel like they're realistically receiving less light.</p>

<h3>Adding Line Art Shadows</h3>

<p>I sometimes add <strong>line art shadows</strong> or occluded shadows in the line work. This can define volumes even more and accentuate the piece. It's a more drawing-oriented activity and can add texture and movement to the image.</p>

<p>If you choose to do this, consider adding these shadows on a separate layer. This way, you have the flexibility to adjust or erase them without affecting your original line work.</p>

<h2>Balancing Detail and Readability</h2>

<p>It's important to avoid covering up lines that define objects within your scene. You don't want it to turn into a mess of lines. Keep certain things readable as separate. Sometimes adding too much can make the piece feel busy or overwhelming.</p>

<p>Checking in with your artwork to see if it's going in the direction you like is crucial. Sometimes looking at it from a distance or taking a break helps you see if you've overworked certain areas.</p>

<h2>The Importance of Practice and Experience</h2>

<p>When it comes to shading humans, being familiar with the anatomy of muscles and seeing a lot of figures helps you understand where the curves are and where form shadows occur. It's about experience and practice. The more you do it, the more it becomes second nature.</p>

<p>Understanding basic shapes and how light interacts with them is key. Even though shading might seem simple conceptually, it's the repeated practice that builds confidence and skill.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p>That wraps up the shading portion of my process. These are the things I generally adjust with shading. Now, let's move on to lighting.</p>
