<p>In this project, you'll explore <strong>Notan Master Thumbnails</strong> to help you see value relationships and organize them into groups. You'll start with the easiest approach, using just <strong>two or three values</strong>. This practice will enhance your ability to observe and interpret value thresholds in your drawings.</p>

<h2>Level 1 Project: Two to Three Value Studies</h2>

<h3>Two-Value Studies</h3>

<p>Begin by creating thumbnails using <strong>two values</strong>: <strong>lights and darks</strong>. Your goal is to find the <strong>threshold</strong> where you'll decide if a particular area belongs to the light or dark group. This threshold varies depending on the image you're working with.</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Lights</strong>: Areas lighter than the threshold.</li>

<li><strong>Darks</strong>: Areas darker than the threshold.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Three-Value Studies</h3>

<p>Next, incorporate a <strong>mid value</strong> into your thumbnails, resulting in <strong>three values</strong>:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Lights</strong></li>

<li><strong>Mids</strong></li>

<li><strong>Darks</strong></li>

</ul>

<p>The <strong>mid value</strong> is useful for areas that aren't clearly light or dark and could belong to either group. Including this value helps manage those ambiguous areas in your drawings.</p>

<h2>Inspiration from Charles Bargue</h2>

<p>Familiarity with <strong>Charles Bargue</strong>'s work can be beneficial. He was an instructor known for his system that teaches how to render form. At the beginning of his program, students separate drawings into light and dark areas.</p>

<p>In this project, you'll be doing something similar to that first step. Consider looking at examples from his book for inspiration.</p>

<h2>Level 2 Project: Advanced Still Life Thumbnails</h2>

<p>For those at a more intermediate or advanced level, you'll set up your own still life and apply the same principles.</p>

<h3>Setting Up Your Own Still Life</h3>

<ul>

<li><strong>Create a still life</strong>: Arrange objects that interest you.</li>

<li><strong>Light your setup</strong>: Use a direct and clear light source to create distinct light and dark areas.</li>

<li><strong>Photograph your still life</strong>: Capture images to work from.</li>

<li><strong>Create thumbnails</strong>: Do small studies of your photos focusing on value separation.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Tips for Lighting and Subject Selection</h3>

<ul>

<li><strong>Use a clear, direct light source</strong>: This helps achieve clear forms with light and dark separation.</li>

<li><strong>Avoid very soft lighting</strong>: It can make it more difficult to distinguish value separations.</li>

<li><strong>Choose interesting shapes</strong>: Select subjects with intriguing forms that you want to study.</li>

</ul>

<p>Remember to have fun with this project and choose subjects that inspire you. Happy drawing!</p>
