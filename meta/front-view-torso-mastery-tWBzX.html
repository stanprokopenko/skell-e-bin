<h2>Starting with an Egg Shape</h2>

<p>I like to begin with a simple <strong>egg or oval</strong> to represent the rib cage. It’s not always going to be perfectly neat, but I aim for a rough oval that captures the overall mass. The front view can feel tricky because everything is symmetrical, so starting with this egg shape helps establish a center.</p>

<p>I keep in mind how the rib cage opens up at the bottom, where it joins the abdominal region. I often draw through the form to locate key landmarks, like the navel. If I run a light line through the bottom of the rib cage, that line usually leads me right to where the navel sits.</p>

<h2>Linking Pectoralis and Deltoid</h2>

<p>When the arms are raised, the <strong>pectoral muscles</strong> can appear to merge with the <strong>deltoids</strong> into one unified shape. This is especially true when the arms lift to the sides or overhead. Sometimes, I imagine bridging this area so I can capture how the pecs flow into the shoulder region.</p>

<p>I notice that George Bridgman’s drawings might minimize the shoulder or simply fade it out when he’s focusing on the torso. I tend to refine those areas a bit more for clarity. But I still like bridging man’s approach of treating the shoulder and pec like one unit when the arms are lifted.</p>

<h2>Observing the Abs and Navel</h2>

<p>Bridgman’s torso drawings show a recognizable approach to the <strong>abdominal wall</strong>: blocks of abs stacked in varying ways. Some people have symmetrical abs, others have an offset “stagger.” Genetics play a huge role, and I don’t assume everyone’s abs align uniformly. I note the <strong>epigastric region</strong> above the navel, where there can be a little protrusion or dip. Bridgman sometimes likens this section to a bent finger shape.</p>

<p>The <strong>navel</strong> itself usually has a small flap of skin on top, especially on lean, muscular bodies. It might look like a slight indent or pucker, and I’ll shade around it to suggest depth.</p>

<h2>Inguinal Ligaments and Obliques</h2>

<p>At the lower part of the torso, I can see the <strong>inguinal ligaments</strong> curving from the pelvic bone to the pubic area. Below that is where the genitals would be, so Bridgman typically leaves that space unrendered. The lower abs often split into two elongated sections on either side of the midline.</p>

<p>Off to the sides, I watch how the <strong>external obliques</strong> overlap with the serratus anterior muscles. They weave together in little finger-like shapes along the rib cage. In some drawings, Bridgman indicates them more minimally. I sometimes add a bit more detail or a soft shading to show how these muscles trip in and out of one another.</p>

<h2>Latissimus and Serratus Interaction</h2>

<p>Toward the back, the <strong>latissimus dorsi</strong> emerges from under the arms and sweeps around the side. Where it meets the serratus anterior, I see those characteristic finger-digitation shapes. Bridgman hints at them with lines and tonal transitions, but I often like to push them a bit further, adding more overlap so it’s easier to see which shape is on top and which dips underneath.</p>

<h2>Tonal Shading for Form</h2>

<p>Bridgman’s original sketches can sometimes appear scratchy or minimal in tone. I like to <strong>layer</strong> my shading in subtle passes, lay down a shadow, blend it with a finger, erase out a highlight, then reinforce an edge. This layering approach makes the torso appear rounder and more dimensional. It takes patience and going back and forth between refining edges and smoothing out halftones.</p>

<p>There’s value in building up your shadow structure gradually. It’s the same process you’d use to depict a dent in a helmet or a fold in drapery, hard edges, soft edges, and shape containment. Repeatedly punching in darks and lifting out lights gives you that controlled sense of 3D volume.</p>

<h2>Designing Body Types</h2>

<p>People come in all shapes and sizes. Some of Bridgman’s figures look especially <strong>muscular</strong>, while others are more rounded. Historic art trends have alternated between favoring lean forms and more Rubenesque forms. I remind myself to stay prepared for different references. It’s helpful to know how to draw from multiple viewpoints and to adapt. When I study or copy an artist, I’ll cross-reference with real anatomy references, other artists’ interpretations, and anatomical apps if I want more clarity.</p>

<h2>Taste and Aesthetics</h2>

<p>I’m always fascinated by how individuals develop a unique vision. Artists like <strong>Mucha</strong>, <strong>Leyendecker</strong>, or <strong>Michelangelo</strong> have such distinctive designs, people still marvel at them. There’s a bit of mystery in how they achieved that genius sense of shape and arrangement. I do believe that <em>some</em> aspects of taste are personal, while <em>others</em>, like a pleasing balance of shapes or compelling composition, can be learned.</p>

<p>Focusing on <strong>striking silhouettes</strong>, <strong>interesting rhythms</strong>, and <strong>variation in shapes</strong> goes a long way in making the figure feel alive. I like to borrow ideas from favorite artists, then adapt them to my own style. This is a game of constantly <strong>cherry-picking</strong> techniques and storing them in your mental library.</p>

<h2>Consistency and Practice</h2>

<p>Being consistent is a big part of professional drawing. Sometimes a single drawing can feel easy, but under normal work conditions, such as tight deadlines, long projects, and multiple revisions, consistency becomes vital. Even seasoned artists have the occasional doubt, but steady practice and repeated studies build the necessary confidence to tackle each figure efficiently.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p>Drawing the front view of the torso involves mindful observation of structure and shape. I begin with a simple egg form for the rib cage, connect pectorals to deltoids, lay in the abs with awareness of their natural staggering, and watch the interplay of obliques and serratus along the sides. I use tonal shading to suggest depth, and spend time clarifying my edges and transitions. By cross-referencing different approaches, including Bridgman, I discover ways to improve clarity and design. In the end, it’s this thoughtful, layered practice that strengthens my anatomy knowledge and helps me grow as an artist.</p>
