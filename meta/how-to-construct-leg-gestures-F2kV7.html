<h2>Thigh Construction</h2>

<p>I like to start by <strong>tapering the thigh</strong>. I make the <strong>backside</strong> of the thigh less curved than the <strong>front side</strong>, which often has a fuller curve leading down to the knee. As I sketch, I watch for those <strong>subtle or not-so-subtle curves</strong> that can appear on a muscular figure. </p>

<p>I also keep in mind how the thigh transitions into the <strong>hip</strong> area, but I usually address that hip construction separately. For now, I focus on drawing a <strong>smooth flow</strong> from the back of the hip down into the <strong>hamstring area</strong> of the thigh.</p>

<h2>Vertical Alignment</h2>

<p>When I'm looking at the leg in profile, I search for <strong>vertical or near-vertical alignments</strong>. If I see a line that’s nearly vertical, I often choose to make it fully vertical in my sketch. This approach helps me with <strong>structure</strong> and shows me how far off the vertical each curve deviates. Tracking this verticality keeps the overall leg form <strong>strong and clear</strong>.</p>

<h2>Lower Leg and the S-Curve</h2>

<p>From the knee down, I often notice a <strong>gentle S-curve</strong> along the lower leg. There may be a <strong>small bump</strong> around the calf as it transitions toward the foot, and I keep that continuous flow in mind when sketching. It often flows into the <strong>foot</strong>, which grounds the figure. </p>

<h2>Bent Leg Variations</h2>

<p>When the leg is <strong>bent</strong>, the thigh and calf can bunch up around the knee, which affects the tapering. The corner at the knee can become more pronounced, or even show <strong>two or three small corners</strong> if the leg changes direction. Sometimes it’s more of a <strong>hard angle</strong> than a smooth curve. Depending on the pose, I adjust how I combine straight edges and corners to show the leg’s articulation.</p>

<p>These basic forms give me a solid foundation for drawing legs in profile because they help me see <strong>flow, shape, and structure</strong> all at once.</p>
