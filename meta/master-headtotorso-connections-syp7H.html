<h2>Simplifying the Head</h2>

<p>You can treat the head as a <strong>simple but characteristic form</strong>. One approach is to use a <strong>boxier structure</strong> on top to represent the skull, then add a <strong>separate form</strong> for the jaw and chin. You might also use an <strong>egg shape</strong> for the lower part and keep the upper part boxier, or explore any other mashup that fits your style.</p>

<p>This construction remains the same for both male and female heads. The male head is often larger, with a <strong>thicker neck</strong> that can be close to the same width as the head. Females might have a <strong>thinner neck</strong>, but the general head and neck placement is the same.</p>

<h2>Front View</h2>

<h3>Center Line and Neck Placement</h3>

<p>• Start with a simple head shape.<br />

• Place the <strong>center line</strong> of the face, noting how it can shift if the head turns.<br />

• Draw the <strong>throat</strong> connecting from the center of the face down to the <strong>pit of the neck</strong>. This pit sits near the <strong>collarbone</strong>.  </p>

<p>Remember that the torso sometimes moves or faces another direction. In that case, the throat will aim toward the center of the torso to maintain proper alignment.</p>

<h3>Shoulder Line and Shrugging Muscle</h3>

<p>• Sketch your <strong>shoulder line</strong> a bit above the pit of the neck.<br />

• The <strong>shrugging muscle</strong> (like a “volcano” or sagging triangle) extends from the shoulders and goes <strong>behind</strong> the neck. This overlap is important, especially in a male or a heavily muscled figure.  </p>

<h3>Connecting to the Torso</h3>

<p>Use a <strong>“Coke bottle” approach</strong> to smoothly form the rib cage area. This shape helps you see where the torso bulges and narrows. Position it so that it underpins the shoulders and extends below the neck. You can adjust the width if you need a thinner or bulkier build.</p>

<h2>Back View</h2>

<h3>Skull vs Face from Behind</h3>

<p>From the back, you mostly see the <strong>skull</strong> rather than the face. You can draw a <strong>ball</strong> shape for the back of the head. The <strong>neck</strong> and <strong>shrugging muscles</strong> will overlap in reverse order compared to the front.</p>

<p>• The shrugging muscle now appears in <strong>front</strong> of the neck from this viewpoint.<br />

• The <strong>neck</strong> sits in <strong>front</strong> of the skull’s underside.  </p>

<h3>Aligning the Spine and Rib Cage</h3>

<p>• The <strong>spine</strong> rises higher in back because the ribs come up higher behind the neck.<br />

• You can again use the <strong>Coke bottle shape</strong> for the torso, starting from the neck and tapering or widening as needed.  </p>

<p>Keep in mind that for a female figure, the neck might look thinner, while a male neck can be quite thick and reach the full width of the jaw.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p>Focus on how these shapes overlap in front and back views. When you understand the <strong>center lines</strong>, the <strong>shrugging muscles</strong>, and the <strong>Coke bottle</strong> torso, you’ll create a clear and natural connection from head to neck to torso. This approach simplifies your figure drawing and sets a strong foundation for further details.</p>
