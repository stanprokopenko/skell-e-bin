<p>In this guide, I'll walk you through the process of refining a portrait by focusing on <strong>dark halftones, warmth in facial features, and the importance of edges</strong>. These elements are crucial in creating depth and enhancing the overall quality of your painting.</p>

<h2>Establishing Dark Halftones</h2>

<p>When working on a portrait, I start by cleaning out the head and moving into the darks with value. I use a <strong>dark halftone</strong> by mixing black and alizarin crimson, which keeps the tone warm. This is particularly useful for areas where I plan to play with edges, like around the hairline. It's important to mix darker tones to the limit before they become part of the shadow, still considering them as dark halftones. This helps in defining key areas and ensuring clear color interaction.</p>

<h2>Creating Depth with Halftones</h2>

<p>The interaction of <strong>beard growth, shaved hair, and light</strong> creates a deeper halftone above the muzzle, which is not part of the shadow. I add lighter shadows on the lips to catch some light and interject more warmth, which adds variation and helps achieve a closer accuracy to the intended look. For the chin, I mix black and red into the dark halftone to account for stubble, creating darker halftones. Adding black for the grain of hair against the skin gives a sense of stubble, and as the mustache starts to appear, I incorporate a greater dark halftone.</p>

<h2>Warmth in Facial Features</h2>

<p>Warmth is essential in certain facial features. I add alizarin crimson to the dark areas around the eyes, as these areas tend to be redder. It's crucial to avoid coldness here because <strong>flesh touching flesh creates warm, red creases</strong>. Creases in the face should reflect warmth to convey humanity and blood flow. For instance, the crease on the side of the nose should be warm, not cool, to appear true to life.</p>

<h2>Maintaining Shadow Patterns</h2>

<p>While working on the portrait, I return to the original color to maintain the overall shadow pattern. It's important to demonstrate the minimal importance of shadow areas, focusing on what can be achieved without them. Shadows act as an extra enhancement and should not overtake the painting. Concentrating on what can be done without diving into shadows helps in establishing a strong foundation.</p>

<h2>Importance of Edges</h2>

<p>At this stage, establishing <strong>value and edges</strong> is crucial as they can significantly enhance the painting. Although basic values are established, there might be a choppy quality due to untreated edges. Edges help tell the story of the painting, so understanding them is essential for decision-making. I take a break from painting to focus on edges, aiming to almost finish the piece by refining them.</p>

<h2>Finalizing the Painting</h2>

<p>By concentrating on edges and values, I aim to bring the painting close to completion. This process involves refining the edges and ensuring that the values are well established, which ultimately enhances the overall quality and depth of the portrait.</p>
