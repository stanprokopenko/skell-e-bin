<h2>Understanding Basic Forms and Edges</h2>

<p>In nature, we don't see aggressive lines, so we need to transition from line to value in our drawings. Every area of line can be thought of as one of <strong>three types of forms</strong>: box, cylinder, or sphere. We associate these forms with <strong>specific edge types</strong> to bridge linear and tonal approaches.</p>

<p>The <strong>four edge types</strong> are:</p>

<ul>

<li>Soft (for spheres)</li>

<li>Firm (for cylinders)</li>

<li>Hard (for boxes)</li>

<li>No edge (lost edges)</li>

</ul>

<p>When observing light and shadow on the head, we ask if the area is more box-like, cylindrical, or spherical. This helps us determine which edge type to use.</p>

<h2>Fundamental Lighting Concepts</h2>

<p>When thinking about light, we consider:</p>

<ul>

<li>Type of light (sun, candle, etc.)</li>

<li>Direction of light (top, bottom, etc.)</li>

<li>Value compositions (high key, low key, high contrast, mid-range)</li>

</ul>

<p>There are <strong>eight conditions of light on form</strong>:</p>

<ol>

<li>Highlight</li>

<li>Crest Light</li>

<li>Halftone</li>

<li>Core Shadow</li>

<li>Shadow</li>

<li>Reflected light</li>

<li>Accent</li>

<li>Cast shadow</li>

</ol>

<h3>Core Shadows and Cast Shadows</h3>

<p>The <strong>core shadow</strong> is crucial as it describes the form's turn. It's the darkest part caused by the light angle and marks the separation of light and shadow. We contrast core shadows with cast shadows, which create abrupt dark separations and trace across different surfaces, following form.</p>

<h2>Applying Forms to Facial Features</h2>

<h3>Head and Face</h3>

<p>We understand the head as a ball-like form. The cheekbones can be interpreted flexibly as either cylinders or boxes. The jaw turns more abruptly, like a cylinder.</p>

<h3>Eyes and Eye Socket</h3>

<p>We view the eye as a ball. When lighting the eye socket area, we set it up for light and shadow, considering the cast shadow from the brow that affects the eyelid and eye.</p>

<h3>Nose</h3>

<p>Initially, we can view the nose as a cylinder. The larger form of the nose can be seen as a ball. Plane changes in the nose align with earlier box-like constructions. We pay attention to how the core shadow wraps around the form.</p>

<h3>Mouth and Chin</h3>

<p>The ball of the mouth can be lit separately. We view the chin as an egg shape with a gradual core shadow. The jowl fat blends with the chin's core shadow.</p>

<h3>Ears</h3>

<p>Ears have distinct cast shadow shapes. Shape investigation helps us understand light and shadow interactions on this complex form.</p>

<h2>Techniques for Naturalistic Rendering</h2>

<p>To achieve a more naturalistic look, we focus on <strong>softening edges</strong> and moving away from rigid line drawings. Gradation in forms allows for slower timing and softer edges. We consider how different forms create cast shadows and how surface topography differs across facial features.</p>

<p>We think about <strong>timing the viewer's eye</strong> as it tracks across the surface:</p>

<ul>

<li>Soft edges for spheres move the eye slowly</li>

<li>Firm edges for cylinders move the eye more quickly</li>

<li>Hard edges for boxes create abrupt movement between planes</li>

</ul>

<h2>Value Composition and Shadow Mapping</h2>

<p>After the initial setup, we consider the value composition. We might set the page as value 1, core shadow as value 10, and fill shadow at value 5. Consistent shadow value helps create a sense of form and realism.</p>

<p>We map cast shadows for the nose, neck, and face. For the lips, we use the denture sphere concept, differentiating between form shadows and cast shadows.</p>

<h2>Practical Tips for Portrait Drawing</h2>

<ol>

<li>

<p>Light bigger forms first, rather than focusing on small details. For example, light the whole eye rather than the pupil and iris.</p>

</li>

<li>

<p>Use a light touch in the initial drawing to allow for easier adjustments.</p>

</li>

<li>

<p>Avoid outlining the entire head; use lost edges where light weakens or for compositional purposes.</p>

</li>

<li>

<p>Create a focal point by finishing one eye in more detail.</p>

</li>

<li>

<p>Remember that smaller forms still follow the principles of larger shapes (boxes, cylinders, spheres).</p>

</li>

</ol>

<p>By following these principles and techniques, we can effectively transition from linear drawings to tonal portraits, creating more realistic and dynamic representations of the human face.</p>
