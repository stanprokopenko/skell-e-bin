<h2>What's in Premium?</h2>

<p>In this lesson, you'll learn quick ways to indicate feet and their positioning in gesture drawing. We focus on using basic shapes—like triangles—to represent feet from different views: front, three-quarter, profile, and back. You'll see how adjusting these shapes can capture various gestures, such as taking a step or shifting weight.</p>

<p>We'll cover how to include essential anatomical details like ankle bones and the arches of the foot to add a natural feel to your drawings. Understanding the proportions of the foot compared to the hand will help you draw feet accurately and maintain the figure's balance.</p>

<p>By simplifying feet into four or five lines, you'll ensure your figures are grounded, and their feet effectively convey perspective and placement on the ground plane.</p>
