<p>I’m working through a <strong>Bridgeman anatomy book</strong>, and focusing on a <strong>torso study</strong> that blends two sketches on page 157. One of those sketches shows more skeletal information, specifically where the latissimus attaches to the humerus, while the other adds more visible layers on top. I’m combining them to understand how the skeletal structure supports the muscular forms.</p>

<p>I love these types of studies because they help me understand <strong>muscle groupings</strong>, the shape of the <strong>pelvis</strong>, and how everything lines up around the <strong>rib cage</strong>. My goal is to emphasize the <strong>latissimus</strong>, the <strong>oblique muscles</strong>, and the <strong>serratus</strong> in a concise, clean way so it’s clear and easy to draw from memory.</p>

<h2>Basic Torso Structure</h2>

<h3>The Rib Cage and Pelvic Block</h3>

<p>I start by drawing a <strong>simple egg shape</strong> for the rib cage and then block in a <strong>skeletal pelvis</strong>. I place the rib cage at a gentle angle. From there, I imagine a line down the front where the <strong>abdominal wall</strong> meets. Sometimes I draw the belly shape as a guideline to see if I need to adjust the width of the chest or the belly.</p>

<p>Below the rib cage, I mark in the <strong>pelvic region</strong> as a simple shape. Since Bridgeman often shows a bony structure in one sketch and muscle layers in another, I try to <strong>hybridize</strong> them so I can see bones and muscles at the same time. For instance, I might leave half the pelvis skeletal while the top shows muscle attachments.</p>

<h3>Adjusting as I Go</h3>

<p>I keep my lines very <strong>light</strong> at first. Drawing for me is about <strong>making decisions</strong>, noticing what’s right or wrong, and then <strong>correcting</strong>. If I see the rib cage is too small compared to the pelvis, I just shift it until the <strong>proportions</strong> look good.</p>

<h2>Understanding the Latissimus and Obliques</h2>

<h3>Latissimus Attachments</h3>

<p>The <strong>latissimus</strong> attaches along the <strong>iliac crest</strong> of the pelvis, then fans upward and inserts on the <strong>humerus</strong>. When the arm lifts, there's a sort of <strong>spring-loaded</strong> twist in both the latissimus and the pectoralis. Bridgeman captures that tension in his sketches by wrapping lines around the form.</p>

<h3>Oblique and Serratus Interaction</h3>

<p>The <strong>oblique</strong> runs from the pelvic bone, connecting along the <strong>iliac crest</strong>, then up into the ribs. Meanwhile, the <strong>serratus</strong> muscles fit between the ribs like little sawtooth or fingerlike overlaps. Visually, it’s handy to see these oblique fibers weaving between the serratus attachments. In reality, much of this might be hidden under <strong>fat pads</strong>, but understanding the layering helps me <strong>idealize</strong> a figure.</p>

<p>I also note the <strong>inguinal ligament</strong> along the front of the pelvis, connecting the <strong>anterior superior iliac spine</strong> with the <strong>pubic bone</strong>. This detail matters if I want to clarify how the abdominal area flows into the legs.</p>

<h2>Grouping Muscles vs. Listing Muscles</h2>

<p>Bridgeman teaches me that it's fine to lump structures into <strong>major groups</strong> (flexors, extensors, obliques, latissimus) rather than list every little muscle by its exact name. It’s more helpful to <strong>mass</strong> things into big shapes, especially in actual drawing where finer details might not be visible on the model.</p>

<p>If I need more detailed info, I check a <strong>technical anatomy source</strong> like Elliot Goldfinger. But for a dynamic drawing, Bridgeman’s method of grouping is much clearer and <strong>less overwhelming</strong>.</p>

<h2>The Value of Clean Lines and Lighting</h2>

<h3>Simplifying Bridgeman’s Marks</h3>

<p>Bridgeman’s sketches are <strong>loose and linear</strong>. He focuses on <strong>form</strong> more than light and shadow. Some lines in his sketches look random or scratchy. I try to decide which lines actually describe volume and which are just “noise.” I remove anything that confuses the drawing, because I’m aiming for <strong>clarity</strong>.</p>

<h3>Suggesting Light and Shadow</h3>

<p>Even though Bridgeman doesn’t always show a consistent light source, I’ll sometimes <strong>add shading</strong>. A gentle core shadow under the latissimus or oblique can <strong>unlock</strong> the form. If a shape looks like it’s curving around, I shade it to help it appear <strong>three-dimensional</strong> on the page.</p>

<h3>Staying Light-Handed</h3>

<p>I keep my pencil pressure minimal, so I can <strong>erase and refine</strong>. If you press too hard, you lose the freedom to adjust. You also risk <strong>breaking</strong> leads and carving into the paper. If I see a line’s off, I don’t panic, I just tweak it and move on. That’s how we build confidence in <strong>construction</strong> and <strong>form</strong>.</p>

<h2>Personal Tips and Mindset</h2>

<h3>Embrace Repetition</h3>

<p>I’ve done versions of these Bridgeman studies <strong>countless times</strong> over the years, and I still learn something each time. I like to remind students: drawing a form <strong>just once</strong> won’t do it. You need <strong>multiple passes</strong> over weeks, months, and years.</p>

<h3>Observe Real Bodies</h3>

<p>If you have access to a <strong>gym</strong> or a life drawing session, watch how muscles move. See how the <strong>lat</strong> and <strong>obliques</strong> respond when someone twists or lifts their arms. Even everyday observations of how bodies carry weight help reinforce your understanding.</p>

<h3>Make It Your Own</h3>

<p>I interpret Bridgeman’s lines rather than copy them verbatim. I simplify, remove scratchiness, and invent some gentle <strong>shading</strong>. The important thing is to keep the <strong>structural core</strong> in place. Over time, I’ll apply this structural knowledge to invent poses, <strong>concept art</strong>, or <strong>illustrations</strong> without direct reference.</p>

<h2>Closing Thoughts</h2>

<p>This torso study helps me understand how the <strong>rib cage</strong>, <strong>latissimus</strong>, <strong>obliques</strong>, and <strong>serratus</strong> all fit together. I see where the <strong>pelvis</strong> supports everything below, and how the arms hinge above. By mixing skeletal indications with muscle layering, I get a <strong>more complete</strong> view.</p>

<p>Drawing from Bridgeman’s sketches challenges me to interpret, <strong>clean up</strong>, and refine. The result is an even <strong>clearer</strong> design than the original. This approach shapes my entire philosophy: absorb the knowledge from various sources, then <strong>deliver</strong> it in the most elegant way possible.</p>

<p>I hope this helps you grasp the big ideas of <strong>latissimus</strong>, <strong>oblique</strong>, and <strong>rib cage</strong> construction. Keep up the practice, have fun, and remember not to sweat every detail. Good luck with your studies and <strong>happy drawing</strong>!</p>
