<p>In this advanced head drawing tutorial, we'll explore how to transition from basic proportions to more detailed structural elements. We'll cover key concepts that will help you create more realistic and dynamic head drawings.</p>

<h2>Understanding the Hairline</h2>

<p>The hairline is a crucial element in head drawing, as it marks the transition from the forehead to the top of the head. While its position can vary greatly between individuals, understanding its role is essential for defining the skull structure.</p>

<ul>

<li>The hairline represents where the front of the head becomes the top of the head</li>

<li>Its position can vary (higher, lower, or absent)</li>

<li>It marks a consistent change in surface and texture of the skull</li>

<li>Above the hairline, the skull is rounded and dome-like</li>

<li>Below the hairline, the skull becomes sheer and concave</li>

</ul>

<h2>Introducing the Side Plane</h2>

<p>After establishing basic proportions, we move on to understanding the side plane of the head. This step involves defining the temporal fossa, a significant cutout on the side of the head where one of the muscles of mastication sits.</p>

<p>To define the side plane, we need to identify four key points:</p>

<ol>

<li>Hairline</li>

<li>Base of nose</li>

<li>Temple</li>

<li>Back of skull</li>

</ol>

<p>These points help us <strong>extrude</strong> the side plane, transitioning from simple geometry to a more skull-like form. This process is more about sculpting than organizing space.</p>

<h2>Sculpting the Head Shape</h2>

<p>Our approach to drawing the head involves a series of cuts and additions to refine the basic shape. This method allows us to:</p>

<ul>

<li>Start with simple geometry</li>

<li>Gradually plane it to approximate the reference</li>

<li>Create a form more sympathetic to the skull</li>

</ul>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Starting with an egg shape can save time, as it's already more similar to the skull's form.</p>

<h2>Placing Facial Features</h2>

<h3>Ear Placement and Structure</h3>

<p>The ear typically sits in the back quarter of the side plane. When drawing the ear:</p>

<ul>

<li>Start with a simple C shape</li>

<li>Most ears consist of five planes</li>

<li>Study the differences in length between individuals</li>

<li>The bottom of the ear covers the temporal mandibular joint and auditory meatus</li>

</ul>

<h3>Jaw Construction</h3>

<p>The jaw's angle and shape can vary significantly between individuals and genders. Consider:</p>

<ul>

<li>The angle of the ramus and mandible</li>

<li>Whether it's more angular and straight or smoother with less of a break</li>

</ul>

<h3>Cheekbone and Side Plane</h3>

<p>For the cheekbone, we can use different approaches:</p>

<ul>

<li>The Loomis method: Draw a C-curve from the top of the ear to the corner of the chin</li>

<li>A more bone-expressive approach: Use the temporal mandibular joint as a reference point</li>

</ul>

<p>Remember that the cheek area allows for jaw movement. When drawing, consider how the mouth opening affects this area.</p>

<h2>Developing Eye Sockets</h2>

<p>There are various approaches to drawing eye sockets:</p>

<ul>

<li>Some artists use a large, Cyclops-like cut</li>

<li>Others prefer a more organic, skull-like approach</li>

</ul>

<p>The key is to show how the sockets lean back in contrast to the protruding forehead. This helps develop space and architecture in your drawing.</p>

<h2>The Denture Sphere</h2>

<p>The denture sphere represents the mass created by the teeth before adding lips. This step helps ensure that:</p>

<ul>

<li>Lips don't appear flat or disconnected from the face</li>

<li>You understand how lips interact with the underlying structure</li>

</ul>

<h2>Understanding Facial Fat and Ligaments</h2>

<p>To add realism to your drawings, consider the subcutaneous fat deposits and ligaments:</p>

<ul>

<li>There are five fat deposits around the eye</li>

<li>The canthral ligament, which holds the eye in place, is crucial for capturing character</li>

<li>The angle of this ligament can greatly affect perceived beauty</li>

<li>Women typically have more retroobicularis oris fat (roof fat), which is often emphasized in idealized drawings</li>

</ul>

<h2>Roadmap Summary</h2>

<p>This approach to head drawing provides a structured way to:</p>

<ul>

<li>Build from basic proportions to detailed structure</li>

<li>Balance universal principles with individual variations</li>

<li>Create a framework for understanding and rendering light and shadow</li>

</ul>

<p>By following this roadmap, you'll be able to create more realistic and dynamic head drawings, whether working from observation or imagination.</p>
