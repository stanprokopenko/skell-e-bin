<h2>Rediscovering My Old Art Projects</h2>

<p>While going through my old work, I found a box filled with <strong>personal projects</strong>. Applying what you're learning to projects that excite you is essential to make the knowledge stick. I was still finding my path as an artist, so some of this work is a little weird.</p>

<h2>Learning from Workshops</h2>

<p>In this box, I found drawings from <strong>Max Turner's workshop</strong> and <strong>Glenn Vilppu's workshop</strong>. Max Turner showed a technique using textured papers, and I experimented with it. There are also lots of gesture sketches from Vilppu's class. These workshops were pivotal in shaping my understanding of drawing.</p>

<h2>Early Experimentations</h2>

<p>Underneath those, I discovered high school work, even before I went to Watts Atelier. There were primitive shapes, still lifes, and even oil paintings from 2002. I was developing a weird turkey illustration and did studies on <strong>egg placement</strong>, <strong>value studies</strong>, and <strong>composition</strong>. I explored how to transition values and designed movements to guide the eye.</p>

<h2>Value Studies and Compositions</h2>

<p>I enjoyed going to the zoo to sketch animals and tried creating compositions that I might see in a magazine like National Geographic. These were <strong>shape design studies</strong>, focusing on subtleties and halftones. I also did caricatures of figures like Gandhi and Lincoln during my high school years.</p>

<h2>Applying Anatomy Knowledge</h2>

<p>As I studied anatomy, I attempted to apply it to creative drawings. One such illustration was a pregnant skeleton woman, representing a juxtaposition of life and death. Looking back, it's a bit cringy, but it was part of my fearless exploration as a young artist. I wish I still had that <strong>"no fear"</strong> mentality today.</p>

<h2>Reflections on Techniques</h2>

<p>I experimented with different techniques:</p>

<ul>

<li>Using a <strong>blending stump</strong> to create gradations.</li>

<li>Working with <strong>cross-hatching</strong> to show lines and turn the form.</li>

<li>Trying <strong>white and black charcoal on toned paper</strong>, exploring color temperatures by overlapping or keeping them separate.</li>

</ul>

<p>At the time, I was proud of how the gradations looked with the blending stump, but now I prefer cross-hatching. I enjoy showing all the lines and how they turn the form.</p>

<h2>Combining Studies into Projects</h2>

<p>One of my projects was a composition of a skinny guy at the gym admiring buff guys working out. I spent a long time figuring out the composition, deliberately designing <strong>light patterns</strong> to lead the eye. I did photo shoots, exaggerated anatomy, and applied knowledge from my anatomy classes. This was a valuable exercise in applying what I was learning to something real and exciting.</p>

<h2>Continuing Personal Exploration</h2>

<p>I often worked on personal projects at home, outside of life drawing classes. These included gouache paintings, self-portraits, and drapery studies. I did value studies and thumbnails to figure out compositions, which helped me in larger works. I even revisited old techniques and experimented with new ones.</p>

<h2>Looking Back and Moving Forward</h2>

<p>All of this work was an important step in my journey to becoming the artist I am today. Reflecting on my old projects reminds me of the importance of personal exploration and applying what I've learned. It's fascinating to see how far I've come and how those early experiences shaped my artistic path.</p>
