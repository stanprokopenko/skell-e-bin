<h2>Limiting the Palette for Better Lighting</h2>

<p>There are a lot of colors on the color wheel, which can really complicate things when it comes to painting good lighting. In this painting, I aimed to push the sense of light and color by <strong>limiting my palette</strong>. Even though the painting looks colorful, I achieved this effect by deciding on the overall temperature of my light source and carefully selecting my colors.</p>

<h2>Choosing Warm Light and Cool Shadows</h2>

<p>I wanted my light source to be <strong>warm and inviting</strong>, so I chose an orange hue. For the shadows, I selected the opposite colorâ€”a blue hue. But I didn't want to use just two colors, so here's the trick: I split these colors off to use two colors in the light and two in the shadows.</p>

<h3>Creating a Quad Palette</h3>

<p>By splitting the warm and cool hues, I created a <strong>quad palette</strong>:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Light Colors</strong>: Orange and Green</li>

<li><strong>Shadow Colors</strong>: Blue and Purple</li>

</ul>

<p>This gave me an entire area of the color wheel to work with, allowing me to reach the colors I needed without feeling overwhelmed.</p>

<h2>Setting Up the Line Drawing</h2>

<p>To start, I generated a line drawing using Photoshop's tools:</p>

<ol>

<li><strong>Duplicate the Layer</strong>: I duplicated the original layer.</li>

<li><strong>Apply Filters</strong>: Went to <em>Filter</em> &gt; <em>Stylize</em> &gt; <strong>Find Edges</strong>.</li>

<li><strong>Adjust Levels</strong>: Pressed <strong>Ctrl+L</strong> to adjust levels and simplify the lines.</li>

<li><strong>Desaturate</strong>: Used <strong>Ctrl+U</strong> to reduce saturation and remove unwanted colors.</li>

<li><strong>Clean Up</strong>: Manually cleaned up the line drawing with the brush tool.</li>

</ol>

<p>I changed the line drawing layer to <strong>Multiply</strong> mode, renamed it for organization, and locked it to prevent accidental painting on it.</p>

<h2>Blocking in the Background</h2>

<p>I started by flooding in the background with cool colors to make the warm light pop forward. Using a textured brush, I applied cool blues in the background. For the water, I used a pure, saturated blue.</p>

<h2>Applying Local Colors</h2>

<p>Local colors are the inherent colors of objects. I laid in the local colors for the main elements:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Monster</strong>: A saturated green.</li>

<li><strong>Girl's Skin</strong>: A peachy reddish hue, slightly grayed.</li>

<li><strong>Dress</strong>: A lighter, grayed-off version of the skin tone.</li>

<li><strong>Hair</strong>: Dark color with enough contrast against the background.</li>

<li><strong>Eyes</strong>: Used blues to give them more pop.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Introducing Light and Shadow</h2>

<h3>Determining Light and Shadow Areas</h3>

<p>With the local colors in place, I determined where the light and shadows would fall. Since my light is warm, I used the warm colors for the light areas and the cool colors for the shadows.</p>

<h3>Painting Shadows with Multiply Mode</h3>

<p>I created a new layer set to <strong>Multiply</strong> mode for shadows:</p>

<ul>

<li>Started with the blue from my shadow palette.</li>

<li><strong>Desaturated</strong> and lightened it, since Multiply mode darkens colors.</li>

<li>Applied shadows loosely, not worrying about exact shapes.</li>

<li>Switched between blue and purple to introduce variety in the shadows.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Adding Light with Overlay Mode</h3>

<p>For the light areas, I:</p>

<ul>

<li>Selected the orange from my light palette.</li>

<li>Used a soft brush set to <strong>Overlay</strong> mode.</li>

<li>Applied light where the warm light would naturally hit.</li>

<li>Introduced green to ensure the monster still looked green.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Building Color Harmony</h2>

<p>To achieve color harmony, I:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Carried colors through the painting</strong>: Introduced colors from my palette into different areas.</li>

<li><strong>Desaturated colors to bridge hues</strong>: Bringing colors closer to gray brings them closer to each other.</li>

<li><strong>Varied saturation</strong>: Added neutrals into saturated areas and vice versa.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Enhancing Shadows with Ambient Light</h2>

<p>I added ambient light to the shadows to reflect the environment:</p>

<ul>

<li>Used desaturated blues for ambient light on the monster's face.</li>

<li>Lightened shadows where ambient light from the sky would naturally hit.</li>

<li>Maintained the limited palette while adding richness to the colors.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Refining the Painting</h2>

<h3>Adjusting Values and Edges</h3>

<ul>

<li><strong>Value Contrast</strong>: Ensured the monster's shadows were lighter than the dark background.</li>

<li><strong>Edges</strong>: Used medium edges to have room to make them harder or softer later.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Developing the Characters</h3>

<p>I focused on the characters to bring them to life:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Monster's Features</strong>: Brought out his eyes and smile, adding subtle details.</li>

<li><strong>Girl's Features</strong>: Added eyes, nose, and hands holding the book.</li>

<li><strong>Hair and Clothing</strong>: Introduced colors from the palette to add depth and cohesion.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Using the Smudge Tool for Texture</h2>

<p>I employed the <strong>smudge tool</strong> to:</p>

<ul>

<li>Create diffuse edges on the monster's fur.</li>

<li>Blend colors seamlessly for soft transitions.</li>

<li>Add texture to areas like the monster's belly and the girl's hair.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Adding Final Details</h2>

<h3>Ambient Occlusion and Highlights</h3>

<ul>

<li>Added <strong>ambient occlusion</strong> in areas with limited light, like where the monster meets the water.</li>

<li>Applied highlights to the monster's eyes and other key features.</li>

<li>Adjusted occlusion shadows to enhance depth.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Enhancing Color Temperature</h3>

<ul>

<li>Introduced warmer or cooler hues to various areas to add interest.</li>

<li>Used soft edges to blend colors naturally.</li>

<li>Carefully increased saturation in select areas for emphasis.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Knowing When to Stop</h2>

<p>It's important to recognize when a painting is finished:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Shape Refinement</strong>: When tweaking smaller shapes and details.</li>

<li><strong>Color Dispersion</strong>: When the palette's colors are well-distributed throughout.</li>

<li><strong>Feedback</strong>: Showing the work to someone else can offer fresh perspectives.</li>

<li><strong>Avoid Overworking</strong>: Remember, adding more isn't always better.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Final Touches</h2>

<p>I added reflections in the water:</p>

<ul>

<li>Used an <strong>Overlay</strong> brush with the monster's colors.</li>

<li>Suggested reflections with loose, horizontal strokes.</li>

<li>Incorporated colors from the palette to ensure cohesion.</li>

</ul>

<p>Lastly, I added subtle <strong>God rays</strong> using a soft airbrush set to <strong>Linear Dodge</strong> mode:</p>

<ul>

<li>Used warm orange to enhance the magical lighting.</li>

<li>Carefully applied to avoid overwhelming the existing light and shadow interplay.</li>

</ul>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p>By limiting myself to <strong>four colors</strong>, I was able to create a painting that feels rich and colorful. This approach simplifies the process and enhances the light and color in the artwork. Would you guess that this painting only uses four colors?</p>
