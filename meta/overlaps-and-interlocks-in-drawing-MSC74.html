<h2>Understanding Connective Strategies</h2>

<p>I like to think of <strong>beanbags</strong> and <strong>drumsticks</strong> as more sophisticated ways to connect forms in figure drawing. Before diving into these, I usually start simple with <strong>curves and corners</strong>:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Curves</strong> when forms flow in a similar direction along their long axis.  </li>

<li><strong>Corners</strong> when there's a big directional change.</li>

</ul>

<p>Examples:<br />

• Hips and rib cage often connect with a curve.<br />

• Shoulders and upper arm can connect off a corner if they turn sharply.</p>

<h2>What Are Beanbags?</h2>

<p>A beanbag groups two or more shapes in a shared “sleeve” that blends on one side and separates on the other. This creates an <strong>overlap</strong>, which helps show depth. I imagine “bags” containing different forms, where they merge smoothly on one side and pull apart on the opposite side. That overlap gives my drawings a sense of three-dimensionality.</p>

<h2>Introducing Drumsticks</h2>

<p>The <strong>drumstick</strong> approach goes beyond overlaps, and creates an <strong>interlock</strong>. One form doesn’t just sit in front of another, it intrudes into it. I can think of a ball-and-stick combination,</p>

<ul>

<li>A ball (the drum) in front of another shape.  </li>

<li>A tube (the stick) inserts partly into the ball’s contour.</li>

</ul>

<p>It’s like fitting a key into a lock, some of the tube’s sides break the ball’s outline, so they become interlocked.</p>

<h2>Overlaps and Interlocks</h2>

<p>With overlaps, I see one shape simply covering part of another, which convinces the eye there’s depth. With interlocks, the shapes share space more dynamically. This is <strong>harder to master</strong>, but it’s very effective for understanding and depicting strong three-dimensional structure.</p>

<h2>Using Deep Perspective</h2>

<p>When the perspective is shallow, sometimes simple bumps with curves and corners are enough. But when forms are drawn in <strong>deep perspective</strong>, overlaps and interlocks become invaluable. One shape is significantly closer, and the other is much farther back. The inserted form reveals the contour of both objects more clearly.</p>

<h2>Variations and Figure Examples</h2>

<p>I can treat the rib cage, waist, and hips in many ways:</p>

<p>• <strong>Female figures</strong> often show a narrower waist interlocking with fuller hips.<br />

• <strong>Male figures</strong> may feature a broad rib cage that tapers toward the waist.  </p>

<p>I might imagine a <strong>big egg</strong> for the hips and a <strong>smaller egg</strong> for the rib cage, with a <strong>tube</strong> (curved or straight) interlocking those two. I can also switch to box-like shapes if that better describes the forms. Sometimes I see these shapes in the organic joints of trees or in figure drawing references (Frank Frazetta’s women are good examples, and Bridgman’s books show similar form ideas).</p>

<h2>Putting It All Together</h2>

<p>My goal is always clarity. If I’m confused, I go back to <strong>curves and corners</strong> to keep it simple. But if I need a stronger sense of depth, I’ll use <strong>beanbags</strong> or <strong>drumsticks</strong>:</p>

<p>• <strong>Beanbags</strong>: Overlapping shapes in a single “sleeve.”<br />

• <strong>Drumsticks</strong>: One shape interlocking with another, giving a deeper perspective.</p>

<p>These strategies help me build figures with a vivid sense of structure and space. By practicing them, maybe sketching torsos from reference, playing with perspective, and watching for how one form folds into another, I can capture the figure’s volumes more convincingly.</p>
