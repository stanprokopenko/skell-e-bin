<p>All right, I'm gonna show you one of the visual memory games. We'll draw a hammer in perspective from a different angle. To do this, we need to draw two matching curves in perspective.</p>

<h2>Drawing Curves in Perspective</h2>

<p>We'll start by drawing a hammer in perspective from a different angle. The key is to match curves in perspective.</p>

<h3>Explanation of Matching Curves in Perspective</h3>

<p>Let's use a blocky form to illustrate. Imagine a block with a vertical and horizontal plane. Instead of a flat wall and floor, we want a curved plane connecting two points. Drawing curves in perspective can be tough, especially if you're new to it. With practice, you'll intuitively see where the curve needs to be. But for now, let's use some helpers to construct it accurately.</p>

<h3>Constructing Curves Using Planes and Points</h3>

<p>Break the curve into manageable planes. Identify key points and corners where the curve changes direction. Transfer these points to the other side by drawing straight lines to connect them. This helps in converting straight lines into a smooth curve.</p>

<h3>Practical Tips for Accuracy</h3>

<p>Practice and intuition are crucial. Use approximations for better accuracy. Check and refine the curve as you go.</p>

<h2>Practical Exercise: Drawing a Hammer from Memory</h2>

<h3>Overview of the Exercise</h3>

<p>We'll combine visual memory games by drawing a hammer from a different angle from memory. Study the forms, understand them, and then draw.</p>

<h3>Studying the Reference</h3>

<p>Observe the major forms of the hammer. Note key dimensions and relationships. Memorize the shapes and details.</p>

<h3>Drawing the Hammer from a Different Angle</h3>

<p>Start with the main block. Ensure clean and accurate lines. Extend and project points to maintain proportions.</p>

<h3>Constructing the Hammer's Parts</h3>

<h4>Drawing the Main Block</h4>

<p>Draw the top plane and ensure proportions. Extend lines for the claws.</p>

<h4>Drawing the Claws</h4>

<p>Draw the curve and find key points. Transfer points to the other side to ensure symmetry and accuracy.</p>

<h4>Drawing the Handle and Cylinders</h4>

<p>Find the back plane and draw ellipses. Ensure consistent angles and proportions. Extend and connect the cylinders.</p>

<h4>Adding Details and Refining the Drawing</h4>

<p>Darken final lines and blot construction lines. Ensure the 3D forms read well. Add cross-contours and final touches.</p>

<h3>Comparing the Drawing with the Reference</h3>

<p>Rotate the 3D model to match the drawing. Identify discrepancies and areas for improvement. Reflect on the accuracy and visual memory.</p>

<h3>Final Thoughts and Tips</h3>

<p>Practice and visual memory are important. Keep practicing and improving. Thank you for watching, and I'll see you in the next one.</p>
