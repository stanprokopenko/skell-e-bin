<h2>Monochromatic Sphere Painting</h2>

<p>Your first assignment is to <strong>paint a sphere using a monochromatic palette</strong>. You can use red like the example provided, or <strong>experiment with a hue of your own choosing</strong>. This exercise serves as a warm-up for the second part of the assignment.</p>

<p>To get the most out of this practice:</p>

<ul>

<li>Try creating <strong>a whole series of monochromatic paintings</strong></li>

<li><strong>Explore different hues</strong> to see what feels and emotions various colors evoke</li>

<li>Pay attention to how the <strong>monochromatic palette affects the overall mood</strong> of your painting</li>

</ul>

<h2>Repainting Existing Artworks</h2>

<p>For the second assignment, you'll be applying your color theory knowledge to existing artworks. Here's what you need to do:</p>

<ol>

<li><strong>Go online and choose some paintings you admire</strong></li>

<li><strong>Create line work</strong> from the chosen piece</li>

<li><strong>Repaint the artwork</strong> using the following color palettes:<ul>

<li>Complementary palette</li>

<li>Split complementary palette</li>

<li>Four-color palette</li>

</ul>

</li>

</ol>

<p><strong>Important</strong>: When repainting, make sure to <strong>keep the same overall lighting as the original artist</strong>. Your task is to <strong>change only the colors</strong> as part of your new palette.</p>

<h2>Submission Guidelines</h2>

<p>When you've completed your assignments, follow these steps:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Post your finished studies</strong></li>

<li><strong>Include the reference you've used</strong> alongside your work</li>

<li>Remember, these will be the pieces that will be critiqued later</li>

</ul>

<h2>Tips for Success</h2>

<p>To make the most of these assignments and improve your color theory skills:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Practice with multiple monochromatic paintings</strong> to get comfortable with the technique</li>

<li><strong>Experiment with different hues</strong> in your monochromatic studies to broaden your understanding of color</li>

<li>When repainting existing artworks, <strong>pay close attention to maintaining the original lighting</strong></li>

<li><strong>Focus on applying the color theory concepts</strong> you've learned throughout the course</li>

<li><strong>Take your time</strong> with each assignment to really explore and understand how different color palettes affect the overall feel of a painting</li>

</ul>

<p>By completing these assignments, you'll gain practical experience in applying color theory concepts and develop a deeper understanding of how different color palettes can impact your artwork. Good luck with your assignments!</p>
