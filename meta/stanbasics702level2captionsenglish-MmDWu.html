<h2>Goal</h2>

<p>You’re moving from free blobs to <strong>blobby heads</strong>. You’ll keep things simple, think in 3D, and practice <strong>edge control</strong> while you shade. You’re not doing a likeness. Proportions don’t matter. You’re inventing simple forms at the same angle and light direction as the model and focusing on how edges reveal the forms.</p>

<h2>Start Simple: The Egg</h2>

<p>If you want the simplest version, start with a single <strong>egg</strong> for the whole head.</p>

<ul>

<li>Assume the light is coming from one side. Shade the egg with a clean shadow shape.</li>

<li>Add a <strong>blobby nose</strong>. Keep its edges <strong>firmer</strong> than the forehead.</li>

<li>Indicate the <strong>bottom plane</strong> under the nose with a firm edge.</li>

<li>Add the <strong>cast shadow</strong> from the nose onto the face.</li>

<li>Adjust the <strong>edge of the face shadow</strong>: very soft on the rounded forehead, then gradually make it <strong>firmer</strong> as it goes down toward the chin. It’s a transition from soft to firm.</li>

</ul>

<p>This looks simple, but it’s hard because you’re inventing how the edges change to describe the form.</p>

<h2>Build the Blobby Head</h2>

<p>Break the head into a few big blobs. Think in 3D. These are masses, not flat shapes. Keep them very simple and clean.</p>

<h3>Core blobs</h3>

<ul>

<li><strong>Cranium</strong>: a rounded mass. If the person’s cranium looks a bit squared off, add small corners.</li>

<li><strong>Jaw</strong>: a separate blob that extends out from the cranium.</li>

<li><strong>Nose</strong>: a very simple triangular blob. Proportions don’t matter.</li>

</ul>

<p>You can stop here and shade just these three.</p>

<h3>Optional blobs</h3>

<ul>

<li><strong>Brow ridge</strong>: a mass across the eyebrows with a sudden plane change from the forehead down into the socket area.</li>

<li><strong>Eyeballs</strong>: spheres set into the deep eye sockets. Don’t draw eyelids, eyebrows, or creases. Just balls.</li>

<li><strong>Muzzle</strong>: imagine a chunk of a tuna can placed over the mouth area. It rounds out forward and also up and down, so it has a side plane and a bottom plane.</li>

<li><strong>Cheeks/cheekbones</strong>: small ovals for the cheek masses. Sometimes fat softens and enlarges this area.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Think 3D: Cross-Contours and Plane Changes</h2>

<p>Treat every blob as a <strong>3D form</strong>. Use <strong>cross-contours</strong> and <strong>rhythms</strong> to find where the planes change.</p>

<ul>

<li>The cranium can take a circular cross-contour.</li>

<li>The jaw and brow ridge have stronger plane changes, so use edges to show those.</li>

<li>Don’t outline everything. Let the edges and shading do the work.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Shade the Blobs</h2>

<p>Start with the big forms, then move to the smaller ones. In the demo, the light is <strong>top right</strong>.</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Cranium</strong>: shade the shadow side. As it meets the brow ridge, indicate the shadow along the ridge up to the nose.</li>

<li><strong>Eyeballs</strong>: lit on the upper-right areas. Keep the <strong>silhouette edges</strong> of the balls sharp. Make the light-to-shadow transition on the ball soft to show roundness. At the ball’s edge where it meets the cheek, it’s a sudden plane change, so keep that edge firm.</li>

<li><strong>Nose</strong>: keep the bridge firmer, and the ball of the nose softer.</li>

<li><strong>Cheek mass</strong>: with light from top right, the bottom-left cheek area falls into shadow. It’s a firm shadow, but <strong>softer</strong> than the bridge of the nose. The forehead is very soft.</li>

<li><strong>Muzzle</strong>: wrap the form as it turns to a side plane and a bottom plane. Indicate the bottom edge of that “can.” Add the <strong>cast shadow</strong> from the nose with a sharp edge. Even if the cast shadow covers the start of an edge, continue the soft transition past it.</li>

<li><strong>Jaw</strong>: most of it is covered by other blobs. The exposed lower jaw is <strong>firm</strong>. On the lit side, the jaw plane can be a little darker and transition softly into the cheek, then get sharper where the jaw is more firm.</li>

</ul>

<p>Keep cleaning edges. Soften what’s too dark, erase and replace lines with half tones where needed. Maintain the hierarchy of edges as you go.</p>

<h2>Edge Control</h2>

<p>Edges tell the story of the form. Use a range:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Sharp</strong>: cast shadows, silhouettes, sudden plane changes (edge of eyeball against cheek).</li>

<li><strong>Firm</strong>: strong plane changes that are not razor sharp (bridge of nose, jaw line).</li>

<li><strong>Soft</strong>: rounded areas with gradual transitions (forehead, cheeks, eyeball’s light-to-shadow).</li>

</ul>

<p>You can even vary edges within the same halftone area:

- One spot softer, another firmer, another very soft, depending on how the form turns.</p>

<h2>Practice</h2>

<ul>

<li>Use the provided portrait photos. Do the <strong>egg</strong> version or the <strong>multi-blob</strong> version, or both.</li>

<li>Keep the forms simple. No eyelids, no wrinkles, no hair, no ears. Just blobs.</li>

<li>After you finish one, make it harder: keep the <strong>same blobs and angle</strong>, and <strong>change the light direction</strong>. Invent how all the edges and shadow shapes move. Adjust everything to match the new light.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Reminders</h2>

<ul>

<li>You’re not drawing a portrait. You’re building and shading <strong>simple blobby shapes</strong>.</li>

<li>Proportions don’t matter here.</li>

<li>Think in 3D with cross-contours and rhythms.</li>

<li>Imagine how these blobs would look if lit like the model.</li>

<li>Focus on the <strong>edges</strong>.</li>
