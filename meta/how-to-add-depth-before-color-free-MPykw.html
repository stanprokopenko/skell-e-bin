<h2>What's in Premium?</h2>

<p>In this premium lesson, you'll learn how to organize your layers by grouping and flattening your <strong>line work</strong> for a clean workspace. We'll guide you through <strong>blocking in flat colors</strong> using tools like the lasso and paint bucket, and show you how to use <strong>clipping masks</strong> to keep your painting within the base shape.</p>

<p>You'll discover how to add <strong>local values</strong> to different materials for added clarity. The lesson covers adding depth with <strong>shadows</strong> using the <strong>Multiply</strong> blending mode and simulating <strong>light fall-off</strong> to enhance the three-dimensional effect.</p>

<p>We dive into refining your values by merging layers, adding <strong>highlights</strong> with the <strong>Screen</strong> blending mode, and techniques for iterating and adjusting your work. By the end, you'll have a strong value foundation ready for adding color to bring your piece to life.</p>
