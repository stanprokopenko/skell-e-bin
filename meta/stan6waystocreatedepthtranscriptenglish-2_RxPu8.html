<p>When you think of perspective, you might imagine complicated grid lines like you're in a 3D computer world. But you don't always need fancy perspective lines to indicate depth. You can use something much simpler called <strong>depth cues</strong>, and they're so simple that they're often overlooked.</p>

<p>Let's go over <strong>six ways to indicate form and depth</strong> in your drawings.</p>

<h2>1. Overlap</h2>

<p>One of the most powerful ways to suggest that something is in front of something else is by using <strong>overlap</strong>. When one object overlaps another, it immediately reads as being in front.</p>

<p>For example, if you draw two elephants and overlap the left elephant over the right one, it looks like two adult elephants with the one on the left in front. If you switch the overlaps, it reverses the effect, and now the elephant on the right is in front.</p>

<p><strong>Overlap</strong> is a simple, foolproof way to suggest depth. It overrides all the other depth cues to communicate what is in front.</p>

<h2>2. Diminution</h2>

<p>But why does the elephant in the back look like an adult when it's behind, and like a baby when it's in front? That's where the next depth cue comes in: <strong>diminution</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Diminution</strong> means that things appear smaller as they go back into the distance. You see this every day—people, cars, and objects in the distance look tiny. If you make an elephant that's far away the same size as an elephant that's close up, it looks like a giant.</p>

<p>Things in the distance get smaller. So, to indicate depth, objects should diminish in size the farther away they are.</p>

<h2>3. Convergence</h2>

<p>But <strong>how much smaller</strong> should things get as they recede into the distance? That's where <strong>convergence</strong> comes in. Objects get smaller and smaller until they reach a point called the <strong>vanishing point</strong>.</p>

<p>In a box, the parallel edges will <strong>converge</strong>, meaning they're angled a bit toward that vanishing point. But not everything is a box. What if there are no obvious parallel edge lines to converge? Well, things will still converge toward the vanishing point.</p>

<p>For example, if you have a person standing close to you, they have a certain height. If you converge their height toward the vanishing point, you can determine how tall they would appear at any point in the distance. Their height, waistline, and any point along their body converge toward the same vanishing point.</p>

<p>The point here is that you can fit anything into a box. If you can converge a box's edges toward a vanishing point, you can converge anything.</p>

<h2>4. Foreshortening</h2>

<p>You're going to see over and over again how useful boxes are for <strong>foreshortening</strong>. If you rotate a pencil toward you, it becomes shorter and shorter until it's just a dot—you've become the vanishing point!</p>

<p><strong>Foreshortening</strong> is when things come forward toward us, and their length appears shorter. The crazy thing is that with a 3D object, some part of it will always be foreshortened.</p>

<p>On a box, the top plane is much shorter than if you were to look at it straight down. Same with the sides. When you rotate the box, different planes are foreshortened.</p>

<p>When you look at a face straight on, the side planes appear as very skinny pieces—they're foreshortened. But when the head turns, you see the entire length of the side, and now the front plane is foreshortened.</p>

<p><strong>Boxes help you imagine the planes</strong> of any 3D object so you can foreshorten the planes going forward.</p>

<h2>5. Atmospheric Perspective</h2>

<p>Those four depth cues are all part of <strong>linear perspective</strong>, which you can indicate with lines. The next two are indicated with value or color.</p>

<p><strong>Atmospheric Perspective</strong> is the idea that things farther away have more atmosphere in front of them that hides them—little particles of water or dust in the air. It makes things look like they're receding into a fog. The farther they go into the fog, the harder they are to see.</p>

<p>You've already learned how that applies to lines. When you apply depth to line weight, you make the lines that are farther away lighter. So, if you can apply atmosphere to your lines, doesn't that make it linear perspective? Well, yes—it is both linear and tonal. It's the bridge between the two.</p>

<h2>6. Rendering</h2>

<p>The next depth cue is purely tonal. It's called <strong>rendering</strong>. This is where you use the laws of light to shade and reveal the three-dimensional form of an object.</p>

<p>You'll learn more about rendering in the values and edges section of this course. It's extremely fun, but for now, let's focus on the first four depth cues: <strong>Overlap</strong>, <strong>Diminution</strong>, <strong>Convergence</strong>, and <strong>Foreshortening</strong>.</p>

<p>In the next lesson, you'll learn how to draw using one-point perspective. See you next time!</p>
