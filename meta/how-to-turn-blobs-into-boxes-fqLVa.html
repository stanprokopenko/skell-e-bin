<h2>Understanding the Three Sets of Lines</h2>

<p>In your journey from <strong>blobs to boxes</strong>, focus on the three primary sets of lines:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Left to Right Lines</strong></li>

<li><strong>Up and Down Lines</strong></li>

<li><strong>Front to Back Lines</strong></li>

</ul>

<p>When transforming a blob into a box, ensure each line corresponds to these directions. Every line should align with the <strong>front to back lines</strong>, stopping where they intersect the <strong>up and down lines</strong>. This approach simplifies complex forms into manageable shapes.</p>

<h2>Foreshortening and Overlap</h2>

<p><strong>Foreshortening</strong> is a crucial concept. As objects tilt and turn, they appear compressed. Pay attention to how curves and planes behave when viewed from different angles. For instance, when looking directly at a plane, it may not reveal its depth, but shifting your perspective introduces foreshortening.</p>

<p>Incorporate <strong>overlaps</strong> to enhance depth. When a <strong>fleshy form bends</strong>, one side <strong>stretches</strong> while the other <strong>squashes</strong>. Emphasizing this squash and stretch conveys a sense of form moving in space.</p>

<h2>Avoid Worrying About Proportions and Vanishing Points</h2>

<p>At this stage, <strong>don't get bogged down by proportions or vanishing points</strong>. The goal is to <strong>simplify forms</strong> and understand their basic structure. Focusing too much on precision can hinder your progress. <strong>Proportions</strong> will become important in later lessons, so for now, concentrate on capturing the essence of the form.</p>

<h2>Choosing Subjects You Enjoy</h2>

<p>Select objects that <strong>interest you</strong>. Whether it's <strong>armor</strong>, a <strong>beetle</strong>, or everyday items, drawing subjects you love keeps you motivated. When you're passionate about the subject, you're more likely to <strong>enjoy the process</strong> and <strong>improve your skills</strong>.</p>

<h2>Daring to Foreshorten</h2>

<p>Challenge yourself by attempting <strong>extreme foreshortening</strong>. It's a bold move that pushes your understanding of perspective. Don't shy away from difficult angles or complex forms. Embrace the opportunity to <strong>experiment</strong> and <strong>learn from mistakes</strong>.</p>

<h2>Learning from Others</h2>

<p>Observe how fellow students tackle assignments. Sharing work and <strong>helping each other</strong> enriches the learning experience. For example, some students create <strong>teaching pages</strong> or provide <strong>step-by-step explanations</strong>. Engaging with your peers fosters a supportive community and offers new insights.</p>

<h2>Looking Ahead</h2>

<p>In upcoming lessons, you'll:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Extrude your name in space</strong>, turning it into a finished illustration.</li>

<li>Explore <strong>no-point perspective</strong>, diving deeper into orthographic drawings.</li>

<li>Understand the <strong>three line systems</strong> and how they create complex forms.</li>

<li>Learn to <strong>estimate proportions</strong> and use <strong>grids</strong> to control vanishing points.</li>

</ul>

<p>Remember, the focus now is on building a strong foundation. <strong>Enjoy the journey</strong>, keep practicing, and don't hesitate to take risks in your drawings. Your efforts now will pay off as you advance to more complex concepts.</p>
