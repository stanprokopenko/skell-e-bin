<p>Perspective adds depth to your drawings, but shading light and shadow is the key to making them look truly three-dimensional. Understanding how light interacts with forms will elevate your artwork from flat to realistic.</p>

<h2>Planes</h2>

<p>When <strong>light hits an object</strong>, it reveals the object's <strong>planes</strong>, the small, flat facets across the surface. Even on smooth forms, imagining them as composed of many smaller planes helps you understand how the form turns. Planes facing the light are part of the <strong>light family</strong>, while planes facing away are part of the <strong>shadow family</strong>. Clearly communicating which parts of the object are in light and which are in shadow is essential when shading.</p>

<h2>Parts of Light and Shadow</h2>

<p>Consider a simple sphere on a surface with one light source. Light on form is typically broken down into distinct zones:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Terminator</strong>: The edge where light transitions into shadow.</li>

<li><strong>Form shadow</strong>: The area turning away from the light source.</li>

<li><strong>Cast shadow</strong>: Occurs when an object blocks light from hitting another surface.</li>

<li><strong>Center light</strong>: The point facing directly toward the light source.</li>

<li><strong>Halftones</strong>: As the form turns away from the center light, halftones get darker until they reach the terminator.</li>

<li><strong>Highlights</strong> - Reflections of the light source itself, visible on shiny materials.</li>

<li><strong>Reflected light</strong>: Light bouncing from the environment into the shadow area, gently lightening it.</li>

<li><strong>Core shadow</strong>: The darkest part of the form shadow, usually along the terminator.</li>

<li><strong>Occlusion shadows</strong>: Found in tight crevices where objects touch, often the darkest values.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Establishing the Value Structure</h2>

<p>Think in terms of limited value groups, light, medium, and dark. Group the elements you've learned into value zones with hard edges, without blending or gradations.</p>

<p>Start by separating the light and shadow areas. Block in the entire shadow area with a darker value representing the <strong>reflected light</strong>, the lightest part of the shadow.</p>

<p>In the <strong>light family</strong>, use three values:</p>

<ol>

<li><strong>Lightest halftone</strong>: The brightest area, excluding any highlights.</li>

<li><strong>Mid halftone</strong>: A medium value as the form starts to turn away from the light.</li>

<li><strong>Dark halftone</strong>: The area just before the terminator.</li>

</ol>

<p>If the material has a clear highlight, simplify the halftones to two values and use the third, brightest value for the <strong>highlight</strong>.</p>

<p>In the <strong>shadow family</strong>, use two values:</p>

<ol>

<li><strong>Reflected light</strong>: The lighter part of the shadow area.</li>

<li><strong>Core shadow</strong>: The darker area along the terminator.</li>

</ol>

<p>You may give the <strong>occlusion shadow</strong> the same value as the core shadow, resulting in a total of five values, three in the lights and two in the shadows.</p>

<p>Remember, shading form isn't as simple as smudging gradations across shapes. It's not a linear gradation from light to shadow. Transitions vary, some steps are subtle, others more dramatic.</p>

<p>What matters most is maintaining the correct <strong>relationships</strong> between these values. As you practice, you'll develop an intuition for how light describes form and become comfortable with the subtle shifts in value that create realistic depth.</p>

<p>Light is your tool for creating the illusion of three dimensions on a flat surface. Master it, and your drawings will never look flat again.</p>
