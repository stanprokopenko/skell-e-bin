<h2>Initial Refinement</h2>

<p>Start with a roughed-out stage and clean up secondary forms using small pieces of clay. Switch between adding clay and using tools to remove rough textures. Focus on secondary forms like fat pads and muscles.</p>

<h2>Tool Usage and Techniques</h2>

<p>Demonstrate the process of working with tools. Explain the tools used, such as a loop tool made from a paper clamp. Shape forms by coming across them, similar to classical sculptures. Incorporate techniques from ancient masters, like crosshatching with chisels.</p>

<h2>Focus on Secondary Forms</h2>

<p>Use direct observation of your own hand as a reference. Add clay to areas needing more mass and clean up with the loop tool. Aim for soft, flowing transitions in wrinkles and forms. Err on the side of subtlety to avoid amateurish abrupt plane changes. Exaggerate anatomy for an anatomical study.</p>

<h2>Smoothing and Blending</h2>

<p>Blend forms together for a softer appearance. Add tendons and veins later, focusing on a smooth surface first. Vary the direction of strokes to add interest to the surface. Use the loop tool to soften transitions and blend added clay. Ensure forms wrap around features like knuckles.</p>

<h2>Detailing and Texturing</h2>

<p>Highlight tendons and concave areas like the snuff box. Isolate and smooth fat pads, especially on the thumb. Prefer tooling the surface over using solvents or heat to melt clay. Be conscious of the forms while smoothing out the surface. Work on knuckles, imagining their spatial existence. Contrast between smoothed and roughed-out areas can be visually interesting. Use a knife to round off and find forms by rolling the blade. Add clay to build out tendons on the back of the hand. Adjust knuckles if necessary, even if it means redoing work to fix mistakes. Draw in wrinkles with a knife to remind yourself of their location. Create a hierarchy of transitions between forms: soft, medium, or hard.</p>

<h2>Iterative Process and Practice</h2>

<p>Larger life-size studies are valuable for detailed observation and learning. Each new sculpture builds knowledge, such as the shape of fat pads on fingers and wrinkles. Becoming a more powerful sculptor and communicator of visual information through anatomy studies and practice. Reworking areas multiple times until satisfied with the result. Building muscle memory for tool use through practice. Preparing the sculpture for adding more wrinkles and veins in the next session. Encouraging sculpting along with demos to solidify principles. Looking forward to seeing others' sculptures and continuing in the next lesson.</p>
