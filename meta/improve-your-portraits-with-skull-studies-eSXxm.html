<p>As an art instructor at Proko, I've found that studying the skull is crucial for improving head construction skills. In this article, I'll share my insights on how to approach skull study effectively, focusing on key areas and techniques that will enhance your understanding of head anatomy.</p>

<h2>Getting Started with Skull Study</h2>

<p>To begin, I <strong>strongly recommend having a physical skull</strong> to look at and study. The Proko skull is a good option for size and quality. When you're ready to start, choose a view and try to integrate the skull into your head construction study. Use gesture steps to capture the overall shape of the skull.</p>

<p>It's important to start thinking about the interior parts early on. Consider the differences between the skull shape and the simplified ball shape often used for head construction. Our goal is to have the skull inform head construction, not to draw a full skull every time.</p>

<h2>Fundamental Approaches</h2>

<p>Treat the skull as simplified, manageable forms rather than getting lost in details. Use the center line and basic proportions (like the nose being halfway between the brow and chin) to guide your drawing. When building curves, think of them as a series of straight lines. Always consider the perspective and thickness of the bones as you draw.</p>

<h2>Key Areas to Focus On</h2>

<h3>Brow and Forehead</h3>

<p>The brow area is crucial for tilting the perspective up or down. Note the flatter surface at the top of the skull that ends behind the temple. The temple area transitions in a complex way to the forehead, so pay close attention to this region.</p>

<h3>Eye Socket and Cheekbone</h3>

<p>When approaching the cheekbone, think of glasses resting on the face. The bottom of the eye socket comes from the cheekbone. Note the superciliary arch above the brow. The eye socket is rounded, then becomes straighter near the temple. Consider how the cheekbone appears on the far side of the face.</p>

<h3>Nasal Area</h3>

<p>Study the nasal area carefully, noting the saddle, spine, and aperture shape. Observe how the cheekbone recesses and curves. Pay attention to where the canine sits relative to the cheekbone.</p>

<h3>Jaw and Teeth</h3>

<p>Note the jaw shape and its connection to the temporalis muscle. Study teeth placement and bite structure. The lower teeth are slightly smaller than the upper, and the mandible forms a mild box shape that the teeth sit on top of.</p>

<h2>Advanced Study Techniques</h2>

<p>To deepen your understanding, try comparing the human skull to animal skulls to note differences. As you draw, ask yourself questions to avoid mindless copying. Use your study sessions to test and advance your theories about head construction.</p>

<h2>Common Pitfalls to Avoid</h2>

<p>Don't get too precious with your drawings - the goal is to learn and improve, not create perfect renderings. Avoid passive copying by staying analytical and investigative throughout your practice.</p>

<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>Remember, the ultimate goal of skull study is to inform and improve your head construction skills. Don't worry about drawing a full skull every time - instead, use your knowledge to enhance your understanding of the head's structure. Keep practicing, stay curious, and most importantly, enjoy the learning process!</p>
