<h2>Basic Proportions</h2>

<p>You want a <strong>2 by 3 ratio</strong> for a generic head: <strong>2 units wide</strong> and <strong>3 units tall</strong>. If you imagine the head as an egg or sphere, cut it horizontally into three equal sections. From a front view, the bottom of the sphere usually lands around the bottom of the nose. The overall head is <strong>longer than it is wide</strong> before adding hair or other features.</p>

<p>The ear often sits <strong>roughly at the middle</strong>, measured from the back of the skull to the front of the ear, and then from the front of the ear to the face. The <strong>hairline</strong>, <strong>eyebrow line</strong>, <strong>nose</strong>, and <strong>chin</strong> can be placed in thirds. Another approach is to see the eyes as <strong>halfway</strong> between the top of the (bald) skull and the bottom of the chin. You can adjust these proportions slightly to exaggerate or refine a character.</p>

<h2>Using Simple Shapes</h2>

<p>You can use an <strong>egg</strong>, <strong>box</strong>, or <strong>tube</strong> to structure the head. Each has pros and cons:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Egg</strong>: Good for capturing the overall mass of the skull.  </li>

<li><strong>Box</strong>: Helps visualize planes and angles.  </li>

<li><strong>Tube</strong>: Easy for cleaning up the main form and working around cylindrical twists.</li>

</ul>

<p>You often need a <strong>mashup</strong> of these shapes because the head has many subtle curves and planes. Begin simple and then refine. Keep in mind that the <strong>back of the skull</strong> extends beyond the face, so include it when you rotate the head away from the front view.</p>

<h2>Drawing the Front View</h2>

<p>It helps to mark a <strong>center line</strong> down the face and a line at the <strong>eyebrows</strong>. From there:</p>

<ul>

<li>Locate the hairline, nose, and chin by comparing lengths.  </li>

<li>Keep all main features, brow line, nose, and mouth corners, <strong>parallel</strong> to each other.</li>

<li>Place the ear around the same horizontal level as the eyebrows, but it can move up or down depending on the angle.</li>

</ul>

<p>You can also <strong>box out</strong> the hairline by drawing parallel lines around the top of the head. This technique clarifies the front plane and edges of the hairstyle.</p>

<h2>Drawing Three-Quarter Views</h2>

<h3>Slightly Above</h3>

<p>When you are looking <strong>slightly down</strong> on the head, the <strong>chin</strong> and <strong>jawline</strong> appear higher compared to the top of the skull. The <strong>center line</strong> will curve accordingly, and features still need to be consistent with each other in perspective. Parallel lines for the brow, nose, mouth, and chin maintain the three-dimensional feel.</p>

<h3>Slightly Underneath</h3>

<p>When you place your viewpoint <strong>under</strong> the head, the <strong>ears</strong> may appear lower, and you might see the <strong>underside</strong> of the chin. Maintain parallel lines for the mouth and nose to anchor your perspective. Even subtle details like a small shadow beneath the chin reinforce the sense of looking from below.</p>

<h2>Practice Tips</h2>

<ul>

<li><strong>Sketch Freely</strong>: Start your drawing lightly, refining as you establish each feature’s position.  </li>

<li><strong>Use Parallel Lines</strong>: Brow, nose, and mouth lines should align in perspective.  </li>

<li><strong>Play with Hair</strong>: Lock in a sense of the skull’s shape first, then layer hair and style on top.  </li>

<li><strong>Refine in Stages</strong>: Add more accurate features after you have a strong sense of the overall shapes.  </li>

</ul>

<p>Keep practicing with different viewpoints to gain confidence. Over time, you will feel comfortable breaking down heads into shapes that clarify structure and perspective.</p>
