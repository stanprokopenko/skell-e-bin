<h2>Setting Up Blobs</h2>

<p>I like to start with simple, organic blobs, just a bunch of oval shapes drawn in different sizes, lengths, and proportions. At first, these ellipses look flat on the page, but my goal is to make them feel three dimensional.</p>

<p>I arrange them so some overlap others, and I decide which shapes are in front and which are behind. Overlapping elements adds depth and starts to suggest forms that push forward or recede. Sometimes I’ll add small secondary forms or tiny wrinkles to convey a “compression” where two blobs meet. I won’t worry too much about how perfect these overlaps are, I’m just inventing shapes and building 3D arrangements.</p>

<h2>Cross-Contour Lines</h2>

<p>Next, I add cross-contour lines to emphasize the blob’s volume. These lines curve around the surface, acting like topographical lines on a map. They help me picture each blob as a fully dimensional object rather than a flat oval. I might also show soft plane breaks by drawing straighter lines in sections, implying a flatter surface rather than a perfect cylinder.</p>

<h2>Diminution</h2>

<p>If I stack similar shapes going back in space, they appear smaller as they recede. By slightly shrinking each shape and making them overlap, they naturally look like they are moving away. It’s a simple method, bigger elements look closer, smaller ones appear further.</p>

<h2>Adding Shadows and Edges</h2>

<p>Once I see my blobs in 3D, I decide where the light is coming from. In this exercise, I keep it simple by imagining a light from above, slightly in front. Then I mass in large shadow areas using a charcoal pencil or graphite, leaving the paper light wherever I think the light hits.</p>

<p>After blocking in shadow shapes, I clarify edges:</p>

<p>• <strong>Silhouettes (outer edges):</strong> I clean up any soft or wobbly outlines to get sharp, smooth silhouettes.<br />

• <strong>Edges within the form,</strong> Wherever one blob meets another, I define a sharp boundary if the transition feels abrupt. Then I refine the form shadow edges themselves, deciding how soft or firm these edges should be to convey a roundness or subtle plane change.</p>

<p>I also pay attention to texture. If my shadows look too grainy, I go back with my pencil tip (or a smudge stick for soft blending) to even things out. This helps me control how crisp or soft my shadow edges are.</p>

<h3>Sharp vs. Soft Edges</h3>

<p>Edges define shape. A sharp edge can make the form feel boxy. A softer edge usually makes it feel round. I often soften the lower parts of the blob’s shadow to show that the form curves gently away from the light. If I want a subtle plane change, I’ll make a slightly firmer edge there. Often, I’ll add a half-tone shape opposite the highlight to further show how the form transitions between light and dark.</p>

<h3>Cast Shadows</h3>

<p>When light hits one blob, it can cast a sharp shadow onto the blob behind it. Adding crisp cast shadows contrasts nicely with the softer form shadows, which helps the blobs stand out. I try not to get too hung up on the perfect angle of each cast shadow, close is good enough to suggest the effect.</p>

<h2>Experimenting and Having Fun</h2>

<p>The best part of these blob exercises is there’s no wrong way. I often cheat perspective or lighting if it helps the final look. As long as I keep my focus on edges, sharpening some and softening others, I learn how each transition changes the sense of volume.</p>

<p>I encourage you to push and pull your shapes and let them organically evolve as you shade. Overlaps, cross-contours, diminution, and attentive shadow edges are strong tools for making simple sketches look convincingly three-dimensional.</p>

<p>Enjoy experimenting with these stress-free blobs, no pressure, just playful exploration of form and edges!</p>
