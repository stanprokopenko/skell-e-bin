<h2>What's in Premium?</h2>

<p>In the premium lesson, you'll expand your understanding of perspective drawing by moving from one-point to multi-point perspectives. You'll learn about the three dimensions—<strong>width</strong>, <strong>height</strong>, and <strong>depth</strong>—and how <strong>orthographic views</strong> (front, side, and top) help you represent these dimensions accurately.</p>

<p>We'll explore how to use orthographic views to establish proportions, visualize forms from different angles, and prepare for drawing objects in one, two, or three-point perspective. You'll engage in a drawing exercise to create orthographic views of an object, enhancing your ability to think in three dimensions.</p>

<p>This lesson strengthens your spatial awareness and builds a foundation for more complex drawings.</p>
