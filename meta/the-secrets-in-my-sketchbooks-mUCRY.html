<h2>The Strathmore Watercolor Sketchbook and the Dynamic Bible</h2>

<p>I want to start with something a bit more historical, and go into something a bit more modern day. This book is an old one, the <strong>Strathmore watercolor sketchbook</strong>. I used this sketchbook a lot during that time period because of its watercolor paper, which I really liked. The book is falling apart now, it's been in archives on my shelf for many years. But this is the first book I used to create the <strong>Dynamic Bible</strong> back in 2016.</p>

<p>The Dynamic Bible is essentially a collection of lecture notes, visuals, and teaching methods that have been curated into a single book from all the classes I taught at Art Center and many other schools. For about six months, I started collecting all that data. So, certain sketchbooks for me can have a <strong>purpose beyond just drawing</strong>, they can be used to produce something with them.</p>

<p>These are all the originals, drawn straight in with pen and watercolor. I scanned these pages and printed them directly into the book. The only thing I edited was some of the text, which I wrote down as I went along. This was the original Dynamic Bible that I made back then.</p>

<p>To be frank, this book wasn't intended to be sold as a printed book. It was only suggested I do so from people on Instagram and friends who said, "You should really print this and sell it." I did this purely for myself at first. I'd been teaching for about three or four years at this time, and I asked myself the question, <strong>Do people understand what I'm talking about?</strong> So, I wanted to jot everything in terms of notes and processes onto the page for myself.</p>

<p>As I was doing it, people saw it as a nice collection of all the notes I was doing in the classroom, which wasn't available outside of Art Center. That's why people kept pushing me, **"Make a book, make a book." ** Initially, I told them, "No, I'm not printing a book." This is for me and my own experience. But eventually, as people talked to me more, I realized there seemed to be quite an audience for it. That's when I created a Kickstarter, made two books of these originals, put them together myself, edited them, and did all the work, distribution, marketing, Kickstarter, and successfully campaigned it.</p>

<p>So, starting from a simple question of whether people understood my note-taking, I completed two of these books in less than six months. This is the original Dynamic Bible, filled with the typical sketches and drawings that I do, processes of shape, form, observational sketching. A lot of them were done on-site, I would go to the museum, a caf√©, sit down in some location, and draw these things by looking at them.</p>

<h3>Observational Sketching and Dynamic Sketching 101</h3>

<p>This is at the LA Natural History Museum. The foundations, structures of muscle memory, lines, shape, movement, form, volume, texture, surface, this is all Dynamic Sketching 101. Looking back now, even though it's been many years, I still like these drawings. I'm sure many of you will look back on your old sketchbooks and think, "I don't want to look at that, it's so bad." But I have sketches that go back even further, even from my time at Art Center in my twenties. I still have drawings, and I remember when I did them, where I was, how it felt, and I still like them.</p>

<p>You have to have those kinds of experiences and moments of liking your work, even if it is old. Even if it's aesthetically or visually somewhat mediocre, the experience of doing it, that moment in time, is something you have to hold on to as a memory. For me, being at these places - this is at Travel Town here in LA - I love being there, being present to those machines, being inside them, feeling the weight in the materials, knowing the weather, everything.</p>

<h2>The Midori Traveler's Journal: My Companion on the Road</h2>

<p>From this, I want to switch it up a little bit, something a bit more unique. It's small, but very intentional in its use. I have a whole collection of books around me right now, but they have specific applications at times. This book was applied towards the idea of <strong>note-taking for dynamic sketching</strong>. This is for traveling. When I go somewhere, I take a book like this with me. This was made by what was known back in the day as Midori and is now called the <strong>Traveler's Journal</strong> - leather-bound.</p>

<h3>Collecting Experiences and Observations</h3>

<p>I collect tons of stuff, drawings, stickers, stamps, whatever the case is. Observational drawing, sketching, this is from 2017. Sometimes I draw differently as well. Still observational drawing, locational studies. This is in Italy, looking at the fountains, and collecting materials. I picked up birch bark, drew on it, and clipped it in there. I found the squares, I didn't want to draw on the paper, but I found this piece and thought, "I'll draw on that."</p>

<p>I write down notes and observations. I don't just draw, I <strong>experience</strong>. Our desire to understand and organize the living world has been a story of wonder, curiosity, and discovery. Observation has led to text and imagery that have matched changing perceptions about nature's order, stuff like that I find to be interesting in terms of perception.</p>

<h3>Travels and Workshops</h3>

<p>Observation again, tons of observation. Insect collections, this is at the Bug Fair at the LA Natural History Museum. From the Bug Fair, collecting cards, meeting people. In 2017, I traveled to Australia and New Zealand. I went to a workshop on how to do taxidermy on insects and bugs. This included the preparation of tarantulas. We had live little specimens, we had to gut them, prepare them, stuff them, and put them on a mount. So, I took all the notes and drew them out in the process.</p>

<h3>Daily Journaling and Collection</h3>

<p>My travels to Australia - where am I going? What am I doing on day one? What am I doing on day two? This is my literal journal, I'm using day to day. Picking up flora, fauna, that kind of stuff. Hair, fur from animals, dinners with friends, different locations - Disneyland. I take it with me everywhere, under my armpit, just carrying it around and collecting as I travel.</p>

<p>I also have a mini version, a book within a book, and yes, it does have sketches in it. Yes, it does have drawings inside, and it has a little insect. This is the Traveler's Journal.</p>

<h2>The Rice Paper Accordion Book: Unfolding Creativity</h2>

<p>From this, let's transition to another kind of book, small again. Scale varies for me, I have big sketchbooks and small sketchbooks. This is a rice paper book, and it opens up as such. You see the different thematic nature of aquatic themes. But the thing is that this book <strong>extends</strong>. As an <strong>accordion book</strong>, it's not like a single page, where it's isolated to a composition. I have to think about how it <strong>transitions to the following page</strong>.</p>

<h3>Thinking Beyond the Single Page</h3>

<p>You could treat it as individual sections, but because it's also connected, I want to make sure that the imagery transitions and envelops into the next one. It goes on and on. These are travels, this is when I was in Paris, went to Versailles, studied some sculptures, observational drawing.</p>

<p>I saw birds and ravens and thought, "Oh, I want to draw those," and turned them into dinosaurs. Then I thought about cavemen. I read books on civil wars. My intention and attraction go everywhere, history, science, biology, observation.</p>

<h3>When in Doubt, Draw Godzilla</h3>

<p>I had to draw Godzilla at some point because I thought, "Man, I don't know what to draw right now. I went from Abraham Lincoln to General Lee. I don't know what to draw next." <strong>When in doubt, go to Godzilla.</strong></p>

<p>This accordion collapses in on itself, and I think, "Okay, I've got, it's done." This was about maybe a couple of months of drawing. But now we're not done, we've got to go to the other side. So we flip it and continue on the other end. We do more and more.</p>

<h3>Studies and Imagination</h3>

<p>Studies from referencing, studies from memory, studies from imagination. Building structures or architectures, small scale, big scale, thinking about positive space and negative space. I'm not trying to just fill up everything, I want to design as I'm drawing also, not design the actual thing, but <strong>design the page</strong> for readability and transition.</p>

<p>Is it telling a story? Not so much, but it is somewhat telling a story about my experiences and thoughts. It goes on, here is a five-point perspective, and that's that accordion book.</p>

<h3>Learning and Evolving Through Sketching</h3>

<p>This was my very first accordion book. I'd never drawn in one before, and once I opened it, I realized I didn't know how to use this thing. I had to solve it. I thought, "Okay, well, all I have to do is try to find a way to go from one page to another." I learned, and then I kept doing more.</p>

<h2>The Etcher Accordion Book: Stretching Perspectives</h2>

<p>Then I found another book. This is coming from Australia, made by a company called <strong>Etcher</strong>. This is also an accordion book.</p>

<h3>Deconstructing and Exploring</h3>

<p>I start with observations of things like airplanes. But then I thought, "Well, I like modeling too." So I drew myself modeling and building this thing. Then I deconstructed the actual airplane, the Corsair on this side and the P-40 Warhawk on that end. All the little elements that go into it, playing with perspective, overlaps, and details.</p>

<p>It's about being able to <strong>play with the idea of not just this being a two-dimensional piece of paper</strong>, but I can push back and forward. This goes this direction, up this way, back. This has a perspective back over here, coming forward this direction, following this way towards the heads of the wolves at the tail.</p>

<h3>Designing the Flow of Imagery</h3>

<p>Each component is also navigating and transitioning, helping your eyes know where to go. How am I doing all this? I didn't have a class on how to make sketchbooks, and how to draw in sketchbooks. It's just that I <strong>have fun with this stuff</strong>. With play, it becomes natural. Again, evolution of process, the process becomes a big part of this.</p>

<h3>Themes and Consistency</h3>

<p>I think about how to show one image that transitions to another, or maybe I show multiple of them. Maybe I'll break it down for you. Now it's about <strong>repetition</strong>, now it's about <strong>consistency</strong>. Interests call my attention.</p>

<p>Now it became sports, NBA, arm wrestling. I love arm wrestling, I've loved it since I was a kid because I watched Sylvester Stallone's <strong>Over the Top</strong>. That's a great movie, I don't care what anybody says, it's awesome.</p>

<h3>The Challenge of Drawing Arm Wrestling</h3>

<p>If you really want a challenge, <strong>draw arm wrestling figures</strong>. It is one of the hardest things to figure out. Most people draw arm wrestling figures with equal competition, meaning the arm is straight up, and they both have equal force being put into it. But in arm wrestling, it's tug and war. There's going to be one of dominance and one of submission.</p>

<p>Where do I put the torque, the power pushed through where the other guy's being strained? This build of the composition, the perspective, the figure, and the pose is one of the hardest things you can do, especially when it's out of your mind. And this is out of my head.</p>

<h2>Expanding Themes and Visualizations in Larger Formats</h2>

<p>Let's switch it up again, let's go larger format. I found this at an art store in Austria, and I loved the paper. What I loved about it was that it <strong>laid flat anywhere I opened it</strong>, and it has to do with the awesome binding. I love the paper surface, and it was blank, so I drew on the cover of this, a space guy with all this squid work that goes to the spine and then to the back.</p>

<h3>Deep Dive into Studies and Observations</h3>

<p>This one's been through a lot, but I drew a lot in this one as well. This was at a time I was really studying a lot from Mongolian culture, a lot of observation, studies upon studies, mostly pen work, a lot of marker studies as well. There are hundreds of pages in this.</p>

<p>At this point in this year, my emphasis of focus was something else. It wasn't perspective per se, but it was about being able to <strong>contort, stretch, and pull</strong>. I was still doing studies at times, all this stuff would have been done with things like fountain pens, brush pens, not so much ballpoint.</p>

<h3>Diverse Subject Matter</h3>

<p>My theme and subject matter are hugely varied. You've seen it so far already, figurative work, creatures and animals, vehicles and machines, stylistic cartooniness to serious monsters and creatures, more realistic proportioning, cybernetics to organics. It's all over the place. The subject doesn't really matter to me because I see them all very similarly, it comes from the dynamic sketching approach.</p>

<h3>Passion for Visualizing Drawing</h3>

<p>It's not necessarily the subject matter that I'm drawn to, it's the very act of <strong>visualizing drawing</strong> that I'm drawn to. That's what I love doing the most. Observational drawings inspire stories. This is about dehorning rhinos, poaching.</p>

<h3>Collaborations and Inspirations</h3>

<p>This is actually at a dinner with <strong>Kim Jung Gi</strong>. This is CTN, one of the last CTN shows that we did before we went to LightBox. Carl Kopinski, Nicolas Nemiri, Ms. Ji Soo - that was Kim Jung Gi, a couple of other artists hanging out. Jung Gi drew in my sketchbook.</p>

<h3>Energized by Fellow Artists</h3>

<p>I have a lot of guests who will come in here, and I will collect sketches too. I love doing that. "Draw in my sketchbook, please." As you guys would walk around asking artists to sketch in your book, I did the same. Even now, I'll do it. Carl drew in it, and then I added my own work.</p>

<p>I get <strong>energized</strong>. I'm sitting next to these guys, and they're drawing in my book, and now I want to draw more. This was from a Katsuya Terada gallery show. I saw him drawing while he was explaining and sketching as well. He drew in that for me a little bit, and then I did an iteration after that.</p>

<h3>Observations from Travels</h3>

<p>I have more study-based methods, breaking down shapes. Here's more of my own studies. All this stuff would have been done with fountain pens, brush pens, mostly ink. It's about trying to expand on interiors and perspectives, creating immersion.</p>

<h3>Continuous Drawing and Rotation</h3>

<p>This was a really good book. I love the paper quality, it drew really nicely. This is in the Pantheon in Rome. But as you can see, the level of intensity in terms of how much I'm drawing page after page after page, as I'm also mixing these sorts of books in rotation with others.</p>

<h2>The Italian Sketchbook: Larger Format Illustrations</h2>

<p>This sketchbook came from Italy, made by a company called <strong>Epica</strong>. They make a certain kind of paper in Italy, which is really amazing. This is very ragged, hand-pressed paper made in a certain region of Italy. I ordered this book, and it was about <strong>$150</strong>.</p>

<h3>Using a Special Sketchbook</h3>

<p>When you buy a sketchbook that is expensive, you might not even want to touch it. But anything I buy, I've got to use it. So I started using this book, amazing paper. This is from 2022 as well. Big format, really fun to work on, a little bit of texture, mostly fountain pen, felt pens, and brush pens.</p>

<h3>Observations and Single Imagery</h3>

<p>This is from that movie <strong>Prey</strong> , part of the Predator series. Studies of clouded leopards, observational study at the aquarium. So I'm hand-carrying this thing, taking it to museums and different places, in Africa again. This is studies of the lions in the Mara, live.</p>

<p>This book feels very different in comparison to other books because this became more about the process of study, but this is more about the <strong>single imagery</strong>. So this is what I don't consider as a sketchbook, this is more of a <strong>drawing book</strong>, an illustration book.</p>

<h3>Illustrating Rather Than Sketching</h3>

<p>Sketching and drawing to me are two separate things. Sketching, I am trying to understand something, problem-solving through proportion, line, shape, and perspective. This I'm observing, but I know what I want to do with it. I am now <strong>illustrating</strong> it.</p>

<h3>Pushing Scale and Action</h3>

<p>I still play with imagination, of course. I can be adventurous in that way. But still, most of the time, it's single imagery. I try to consider the idea of movement, pushing scale, elevating action.</p>

<h3>Responding to Events and Inspirations</h3>

<p>When I got the news of <strong>Kim Jung Gi's passing</strong>, I was stepping outside my door to go to New York Comic Con in 2022. I was literally walking out the door to go to the Uber, and I got the phone call, "Cancel your Uber, cancel New York Comic Con because he was in the hospital." Once I got that call, I already knew what was about to happen.</p>

<p>So I sat on my couch and waited four or five hours, and I got the call. This is at four in the morning. They called me back and said he passed. After that, I stayed up, and the show was canceled. On the weekend, I just processed it, and that was the drawing that I did afterward.</p>

<h3>Exploring Themes and Exhausting Ideas</h3>

<p>Later, I was playing with more themes, Hellraiser, one of my favorite horror movies, The Thing, crustaceans, weird stuff. This was the time I think monster pullovers were becoming popular. Sport players, I love people that work in sports.</p>

<p>I drew <strong>arm wrestling again</strong>. I did one iteration before this one, and to be honest with you, I felt like it wasn't that strong. I did one version, and I was watching a match and drew this out of my head, and something was missing. It just didn't have that intensity. So I had to do it again.</p>

<p>In those situations, <strong>repetition</strong> is something you've got to go after. I wanted to push it way more intensively. I pushed the camera angle, foreshortening, and got the closer perspective. Then I felt satisfied. Okay, now I can move on, no more arm wrestling.</p>

<h3>Favorite Pieces and Ongoing Evolution</h3>

<p>I like this one, probably out of this whole book. This is my <strong>favorite drawing</strong> in this book, it's Ultraman. I don't know why I like it so much. I think it's because of how it felt when I did it. I love the imagery in terms of movement. I like the visceralness of it, the texture of the creature, the violent nature of it as well. I think it's super intensive.</p>

<p>You've got to have those moments. Look back on your work and think, "Man, I love it." And I wanted to do it again with a different character. I don't like this one as much. I enjoyed doing it, I don't want to say I hate it, but I feel like the outcome was more natural on the other one. This one was forced.</p>

<h3>Constant Improvement and Exploration</h3>

<p>It's constantly improving and constantly evolving. It jumps like crazy because, as a personal book, it's just personal studies and things of the imagination. My mind wanders quite a bit, it goes from one theme to another. This one was not so thematic based. The accordion books tend to be a bit more that way because of the unifying nature of evolution. But this one became more about the <strong>singular experience per page</strong>.</p>

<h2>The Raggedy Old Book: A Sketchbook with Character</h2>

<p>This is the book I'm using currently, day to day. It's a <strong>raggedy old book</strong>. I bought this in Utah, I found it at a random shop. It was sitting on a shelf, no price tag, no brand. I have no idea what this thing was. I picked it up, and the paper was yellowish and ragged, and I thought, "Man, this thing is junk." But I loved it so much, it felt nice, and it smelled like a basement, an attic with old stuff sitting in there for decades.</p>

<h3>Building a Relationship with Materials</h3>

<p>This thing was a character, and it was like, "Holy crap, who are you?" I opened it up, there's nothing in it, and I thought, "Maybe I'll tell a story or capture more things and work with this book, this character." To me, <strong>inanimate objects even speak to me</strong>.</p>

<p>I talked earlier about the relationship with materials. When I draw, the paper and the pens, I resonate with them. They speak to me because I'm building this sort of physical relationship of movement. Pressure to speed, line to story, thoughts of imagination to observation, and I'm archiving it onto the page, and this paper is giving that to me.</p>

<h3>Endless Pages and Ongoing Journey</h3>

<p>This is from 2022 to 2023 now, so this is a little bit longer. The amount of pages in this is massive because it looks about as thick as the previous one, but the paper is a little bit thinner. It's about the same size, but it's like sandwiched, you can peel it apart, it's like layers of onions.</p>

<p>The more I think I've gone through it, there's an endless amount of pages, it doesn't seem to end. There's something weird about that to me because, to be honest with you, I thought this sketchbook, I would have finished much earlier. I've been working at this sketchbook for a year now, non-stop drawing. But then I get to a certain point, and it's like, <strong>"Why are there so many pages left?"</strong> ** It doesn't seem to end.</p>

<p>But I'm starting to love that because I hope this is an eternal sketchbook, I hope this is eternity for me. It's this constant relationship that I have with this book, and it won't stop. I think I get to a point where I'm getting close, and it's like, "Holy crap, I have so many pages left over," and it feels so good.</p>

<h3>Valuing the Experience</h3>

<p>Of course, the experience of <strong>finishing a sketchbook</strong> is something you need to do. I've shown you many sketchbooks now, and typically I'm finishing up to 10 to 12 sketchbooks a year. So you've got to have at least even one to know what that feels like, that satisfaction of carrying it through.</p>

<p>This is a character in itself. Each of these books is an individual on my shelf, and I know who they are. Whenever I approach my bookshelf and I see the book, it's like, "I remember you." And I open it up again, it's like, "I remember those moments." That level of value is so much greater, not monetarily, but personally, as growth as a person.</p>

<h3>Recent Sketches and Observations</h3>

<p>These are the most recent sketches, the most recent, and going to the very last moments here on these pages. You'll start to see I'm starting to play more based on line gesture, being a little bit lighter. This is observation, I went to a powwow. Again, more organic animals.</p>

<p>Moving, moving, moving, filling this out. I was camping at the time out of Oregon, a little study of my dad's dog. And this is in New York last week, this is the most recent page. This has been a good book to me.</p>

<h2>The Ongoing Journey of My Sketchbooks</h2>

<p>These are only a couple of years of books that I've grabbed, and these are the ones I grabbed off the shelf this morning before I came here. From the countless books on my shelves, these are the ones I grabbed as quickly as I could, put in my bag, and stuffed them in there. But I <strong>do love them</strong>, and every single one of them, the books that you have not seen, have that same level of investment, that same level of character, interest, travel, experience.</p>

<p><strong>This is me.</strong></p>
