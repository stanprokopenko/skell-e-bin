<p>I'm going to talk about how I develop values on a portrait. In this case, I'm using a portrait of Stan Prokopenko himself. To focus on the values and skip the drawing stage, I decided to trace the photo. However, I <strong>do not recommend tracing</strong> at first because it will do things for you that you won't be able to learn for yourself. Never let the tool do for you what you cannot do for yourself. Remember that drawing is an act of understanding and connection.</p>

<h2>Simplifying the Shapes</h2>

<p>Once you have a complex image like this, it's important to simplify it. Look for <strong>high points and low points</strong> in the form. For example, from the back of the head, there is a big downward action. Identify the <strong>outermost point</strong>, in this case, the ear, and mark it as a high point. Between high and low points, ignore small changes, as they can distract your drawing. Simplify complex curves into straight lines, connecting these points.</p>

<h2>Moving on to Values</h2>

<p>Now that we have the simplified shapes, we'll move on to developing the values. The first stage is what I call the <strong>silhouette stage</strong>.</p>

<h3>The Silhouette Stage</h3>

<p>Think of famous silhouettes, like the iconic photograph of Che Guevara. We recognize his intentions and character just from two values. You don't have to dive into shading or advanced techniques yet. You can capture a lot of information with just light and dark.</p>

<h2>Tools for Developing Values</h2>

<p>I'll use several tools:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Pan Pastel</strong>: A palette knife with a sponge on the tip, useful for smoothing and pushing graphite into the paper.</li>

<li><strong>Synthetic Brush</strong>: I cut the hairs to make it stiffer, which helps press the graphite into the paper and create darker values.</li>

<li><strong>Eraser</strong>: Not just for correcting mistakes, but also as a drawing tool to pick out highlights and clean up shapes.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Creating Flat Shadows</h2>

<p>I start by filling in the shadow areas with a flat value. I'm not thinking about any variations between different parts of the shadow, everything is unified into one clean tone.</p>

<h3>Keeping Shadows Even</h3>

<p>It's important to make the shadows very even. Any variations or chicken scratches in the darks will be more visible, and can distract from the overall form. The shadows should be quiet and smooth. Think of the shadows as the <strong>bass in a band</strong>. They're in the background, keeping the rhythm, while the lights are the solo instruments taking center stage.</p>

<h2>Modeling the Big Forms</h2>

<p>With the flat shadows established, we can start creating the illusion of form. Focus on the <strong>bigger masses first</strong>.</p>

<h3>The Egg Principle</h3>

<p>Consider the head as an egg shape. The light is coming from the top, so it decreases as it moves down, and towards the sides. The forehead is the highest point, receiving the most light. Avoid getting caught up in small details like wrinkles, instead, look at how the values change across the big forms to create the illusion of volume.</p>

<h2>Avoiding Visual Traps</h2>

<p>Our eyes can be deceived due to their limitations. We might think certain areas are lighter or darker than they truly are because of the surrounding values.</p>

<h3>Human Eye's Limitations</h3>

<p>Scientists have found that the range of light intensity in nature is vast, much greater than what our eyes can perceive. The human eye adjusts to focus on specific values within a limited range. This can cause us to exaggerate contrasts when drawing.</p>

<h3>Relative Contrast</h3>

<p>For example, the neck may appear as light as the forehead, but scientifically, it's further from the light source and cannot have the same highlights. Be cautious not to overemphasize contrasts due to these visual limitations. Always consider values in <strong>relationship to the rest of the form</strong>.</p>

<h2>Modeling Smaller Forms</h2>

<p>Once the big form modeling is established, we can move on to the smaller forms.</p>

<h3>Secondary Forms</h3>

<p>Now we can think about features like the nose, eye sockets, and mouth. The nose projects from the egg-shaped head, so we'll darken the sides to show how it turns away from the light. The eye sockets are recessed and will be darker, especially on the side away from the light.</p>

<p>Even the mouth has its own form. The upper lip often projects forward and catches more light, while the sides of the mouth recede into shadow. Remember to keep these transitions subtle.</p>

<h2>Adding the Darkest Darks</h2>

<p>After modeling the smaller forms, we revisit the shadows to establish the darkest values.</p>

<h3>Establishing the Darkest Value</h3>

<p>The <strong>darkest note</strong> in this portrait is the shirt, especially in the shadow. By adding this darkest value, the previously established shadows in the face will appear lighter by comparison.</p>

<h3>Adjusting the Shadows</h3>

<p>Adding the darkest darks helps to balance the overall value range. It prevents the shadows in the face from looking too dark and creates depth in the drawing. The same principle applies to the hair, which is darker towards the bottom and lighter on top due to the way it catches light.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p>By starting with simplified shapes and moving from big forms to smaller forms, we've developed the values in the portrait in an organized way. This method helps create a sense of form and depth without getting lost in details too early. Remember, this process is universal and can be applied to any drawing, regardless of style.</p>

<p>In upcoming lessons, Stan will teach you about edges. I'll come back and focus on edge work to finish this drawing, discussing how <strong>edges contribute to the three-dimensionality</strong> of a portrait.</p>

<p>Thank you for joining me in this process!</p>
