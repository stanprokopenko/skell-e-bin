<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>I like to think of the head and neck as basic shapes fitting onto the torso. Sometimes I use an <strong>egg</strong> or <strong>capsule</strong> shape for the head. When it moves into profile, though, I shift to a <strong>boxy shape</strong> so the face can drop down and the skull can move back without a weak chin. I’ll often add a <strong>sailboat triangle</strong> at the back of the skull to show that higher back of the head. All of it is fluid and can be rounded off or chiseled later as I refine the head.</p>

<h2>Front and Profile of the Head</h2>

<p>When I draw from the front or a three-quarter view, I keep the head shape symmetrical. From a profile, I carefully separate the forehead, face, and back of the skull. I sometimes follow a slight <strong>curve</strong> in the face and skull to maintain a fluid look.</p>

<h3>Adjusting Chin and Skull</h3>

<p>• I keep the <strong>chin</strong> defined by a slightly <strong>boxy</strong> edge if needed.<br />

• The <strong>skull</strong> is higher at the back than at the front.<br />

• I can adjust curves or corners to achieve a fluid or chiseled look.  </p>

<h2>Neck, Throat, and Pit of the Neck</h2>

<p>When placing the neck, I pay attention to the <strong>throat</strong> moving forward from the pit of the neck in profile. I visualize a <strong>tube</strong> or <strong>cylinder</strong> for the neck, and I find its center line. For a male, it’s wider, for a female or child, it’s thinner. The pit of the neck is usually lower than the shoulders, and the <strong>collarbones</strong> slope up or swing in small arcs.</p>

<h2>Torso Connection</h2>

<p>I like to connect the neck to a <strong>tube or “coke bottle”</strong> torso shape. The shoulders are often wider than the waist, so I see three main <strong>segments</strong>:

1. Neck tube.<br />

2. Chest and rib cage (the bigger tube).<br />

3. Waist area (which narrows).  </p>

<p>I draw <strong>through</strong> the arms or shoulders if necessary to ensure I understand the complete structure underneath. Then I can place the shoulder girdle and arms on top.</p>

<h2>Putting It All Together</h2>

<p>In a <strong>front view</strong>, I keep the arrangement of the neck to the torso simple and symmetrical, adjusting later if the pose shifts. In a <strong>profile</strong>, I extend the <strong>center line</strong> straight down through the torso, even if part of it is hidden by the arm or chest. I can play with the <strong>shrugging muscles</strong> or the <strong>sagging triangles</strong> around the neck and shoulders, marking out the trapezius or collarbone area. </p>

<p>As I refine, I <strong>chisel</strong> out planes and shapes, always checking proportions and relationships. I don’t have to make these lines final or perfectly clean right away. It’s enough to feel the main forms and know how they stack. Then I simplify or stylize as needed, whether it’s for a more heroic figure or a softer look.</p>

<p>That’s the process I use to build a wide range of poses, starting with the underlying structure and adding complexity step by step.</p>
