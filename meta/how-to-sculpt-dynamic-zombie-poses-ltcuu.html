<p>Welcome to this spooky Halloween sculpting session. Today, I'm diving into creating a Halloween-themed character. I'll be spinning a wheel to decide which character to sculpt, adding an element of surprise to the process.</p>

<h2>Materials and Tools</h2>

<p>For this quick, fun sculpture, I'm using:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Wire armature</strong>: A basic framework for the sculpture.</li>

<li><strong>Basic sculpting tools</strong>: Some of which I made myself.</li>

<li><strong>Aluminum foil</strong>: To fill out the armature and save on clay.</li>

<li><strong>Wax-based clay</strong>: Similar to the brown microcrystalline wax I've used before.</li>

<li><strong>Character wheel</strong>: To randomly select the character to sculpt.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Choosing the Character and Pose</h2>

<p>I spun the wheel, and it landed on <strong>female zombie</strong>. Keeping with the zombie theme from last time, I'll be sculpting a female zombie today.</p>

<p>For reference, I'm using a pose called <strong>Felicia 007</strong>. The pose feels very zombie-like, with an unbalanced stance and the body twisted in an unnatural way. I plan to <strong>exaggerate</strong> this pose as much as possible to embody a possessed, out-of-control zombie.</p>

<h2>Building the Armature and Posing</h2>

<p>First, I capture the pose using the wire armature:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Push the gesture further</strong>: Exaggerate the pose to enhance the zombie-like qualities.</li>

<li><strong>Adjust the armature</strong>: Bend the arms and legs to reflect the twisted, unnatural stance.</li>

<li><strong>Modify proportions</strong>: Push the hips up to shorten the distance between the torso and legs.</li>

</ul>

<p>This gives me the basic pose, which I can attach to the base using some clay.</p>

<h2>Preparing the Clay and Base</h2>

<p>I'm using a <strong>green-gray wax-based clay</strong>, which suits the zombie theme. To make it easier to work with, I warm it up until it becomes softer and more pliable. In the early stages, softer clay helps build up forms faster.</p>

<p>I build a small base for the sculpture and <strong>press the armature into it</strong>. Then, I fill out parts of the sculpture with <strong>aluminum foil</strong> to save on clay.</p>

<h2>Covering the Armature with Clay</h2>

<p>With a basic understanding of the pose and the foil in place, I cover the armature in a thin layer of clay:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Start from the feet</strong>: Working upward adds stiffness to the lower body.</li>

<li><strong>Keep it thin</strong>: Allows me to build forms without getting too thick too fast.</li>

<li><strong>Use clay pancakes</strong>: For larger areas, flattening the clay helps cover more surface.</li>

</ul>

<p>I make adjustments to the pose as needed, since big changes are easier to make at this stage.</p>

<h2>Blocking in the Head</h2>

<p>For the head, I use a <strong>wedge-shaped block-in</strong>, similar to an axe shape. This helps establish:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Front face plane</strong>: The overall direction the face is looking.</li>

<li><strong>Head proportions</strong>: A good foundation for adding facial features later.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Refining the Major Forms</h2>

<p>Now, I start thinking about the major forms:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Rib cage</strong></li>

<li><strong>Pelvis</strong></li>

<li><strong>Head</strong></li>

</ul>

<p>I also begin adding anatomy details, especially in thicker areas like the legs. I focus on the front angle and then the side view to see how the rib cage compares to the pelvis. Drawing guidelines helps me keep the forms aligned.</p>

<h2>Adjusting Anatomy and Pose</h2>

<p>I notice the wrist is bending the wrong way, so I make that adjustment early on. I imagine this zombie was at a swimming pool in a swimsuit, which lets me work out the anatomy without it being indecent.</p>

<p>I modify the pose slightly to improve the design. As artists, we have the freedom to make such changes to enhance the sculpture.</p>

<h2>Capturing Gestures and Simplifying</h2>

<p>I focus on capturing the gestures:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Legs</strong>: There's a nice gesture where the muscles wrap into the gluteus medius.</li>

<li><strong>Side silhouette</strong>: Simplifying the side view helps avoid adding unnecessary clay.</li>

</ul>

<p>Simplifying the curves and gestures keeps distractions out and emphasizes the overall movement.</p>

<h2>Sculpting the Face and Expression</h2>

<p>To keep the face feminine, I add <strong>hair</strong> to soften the features. For the mouth, I decide to open it unnaturally wide, making it uncanny and unnerving, perfect for a zombie.</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Cheeks tightened over teeth</strong>: Gives a skeletal appearance as the hunger sets in.</li>

<li><strong>Wide-open mouth with teeth showing</strong>: Enhances the horror element.</li>

</ul>

<p>I adjust the arm and head positions so it looks like she's spotted something to devour.</p>

<h2>Refining Details</h2>

<p>I continue to refine the sculpture:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Anatomy</strong>: Adding muscles along the spine toward the trapezius.</li>

<li><strong>Hands</strong>: Capturing the gesture simply, suitable for a gesture study.</li>

<li><strong>Clothing</strong>: Indicating a swimsuit helps focus on simplified anatomical forms.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>This is a <strong>quick gesture study</strong>, done more for fun and to practice anatomy, gesture, and pose without getting bogged down in details. Quick studies like this are great for learning and improving sculpting skills.</p>

<p>I encourage you to try your own gesture studies, maybe even with a Halloween theme. It's a fun way to stay creative and productive. Thanks for joining me in this sculpting session, and I hope to see you in another video.</p>
