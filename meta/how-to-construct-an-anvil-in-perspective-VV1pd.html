<h2>Setting Up the Base Box</h2>

<p>I began with our <strong>orthographic rough drawing</strong> of the anvil, focusing on the <strong>width</strong>, <strong>height</strong>, and <strong>depth</strong>. Even though I'm drawing mostly by hand, I used a straight edge to make the initial lines nice and dark. These lines represent the base of the box on the floor, the set of the prop I'm drawing in this demo.</p>

<p>The <strong>height line</strong> is vertical, and I drew it lightly, knowing that the whole front corner of the box isn't that important, it doesn't make its way into the drawing. I decided how tall to make it, and took it up to a certain height. This established the height and depth of the rectangle.</p>

<p>The depth of the rectangle needed to be credible in comparison to the ortho. I projected the top of the box back to complete the rectangle. It looked a little too deep, so I trimmed it. Now, the adjusted height at the far end is the height of the box.</p>

<p>While the height was easy, it was the <strong>width on the X-axis</strong> that I was seeking. Every time I rehearsed this, I always made this plane too deep. I knew it was too deep because when I projected it back, it turned into a square. So, I tried to underdo it a little and make it a proper rectangle.</p>

<p>I projected lines to check. When the angles were good, I kept them precise to avoid wobbly freehand lines. With a bit of erasing, the base lines now form the box in which this magnificent anvil will sit.</p>

<h2>Finding Centers and Sections</h2>

<p>Next, I needed to know the center of the front plane. Finding the center would make it easier to measure back. I guessed the center point and ran it back on the <strong>X line</strong> to the base. By connecting these points, we have a complete section.</p>

<p>We'll also have other sections, like the halfway point across, which is the <strong>center coronal section</strong>. By connecting these points, we create a <strong>transverse section</strong>, a horizontal plane. We shouldn't overdo these structural lines, or they can become confusing, so we keep them light.</p>

<h2>Constructing the Base</h2>

<p>We're aiming for a base that's a specific height. The halfway point extends beyond the halfway mark. I compared the distances and chose points that would create a credible rectangle in proportion. By extending lines to the other side and connecting the dots, we ensure the base is proportionally correct.</p>

<p>We're looking at the bottom rectangle and ensuring it's longer in depth than in width. Once satisfied, we can start adding the feet later. With some structure now in place, we can proceed.</p>

<h2>Building the Hanging End</h2>

<p>We know the <strong>hanging end</strong>, which is not as high as the base, is about half the width of the whole box but set into the center. I estimated its position, marking the top of the hanging end and running it down. Since it touches the ortho, I could look at it as a flat plane and trust the measurements.</p>

<p>By finding the center of the far plane, right there at the top, we find the point of the horn, the <strong>bick</strong>. Placing it just below the top, since it is rounded off, we can now start building up the intersection. We're looking for a <strong>waist</strong>, <strong>throat</strong>, and <strong>midsection</strong>.</p>

<h2>Defining the Waist and Midsection</h2>

<p>Starting at the top of the base, I found the center point. If the height of the base is one unit, then the entire height up to the halfway point is roughly three units. I ran a line up the center of the entire form.</p>

<p>Looking at the sides, the halfway point seems correct. By running lines back, we're making a subdivision of the center coronal section. Accuracy is key, and one wrong position can make things difficult.</p>

<p>We found the depth halfway back by working with the <strong>height line</strong> and the <strong>depth line</strong>. Next, we determined the depth of the center section. The ortho tells us it goes beyond the halfway point, out to the foot divisions and a little beyond.</p>

<p>By working on a clarified plane, we can determine the width. Finding the center point of the top plane of the neck and breaking it into quarters, we establish how wide it will be. <strong>Halfway up</strong> and <strong>halfway back</strong> meet in a point that tells us the height and width, allowing us to build the rectangle around it.</p>

<p>We may now want to lose some of the structural lines to reduce confusion. Making a straight line from this corner to the base serves as a compromise of the curve line, ensuring we have a reliable structure.</p>

<h2>Adding the Body of the Anvil</h2>

<p>The body of the anvil is fairly narrow, about <strong>one-fourth the width</strong> of the top plane face. Simplifying the lines, we determine its position. We notice the front side goes out further, and we estimate how much further to extend the rectangle.</p>

<p>The side line of the face will go forward on the <strong>Z-axis</strong>. We decide where it stops, it may go beyond the base. Lifting it up gives us a clear resolve.</p>

<p>From the ortho views, we see it starts to taper at the top, getting narrower. We adjust accordingly, dropping it down and bringing it in. The corners of the bick will come from these adjusted points.</p>

<p>We don't want to forget the <strong>collar</strong> extending forward. By extending it appropriately, we can see it clearly. Connecting important lines ensures we capture the structure correctly.</p>

<h2>Drawing the Horn (Bick)</h2>

<p>We take lines from the center below the top of the box and run them consistently, adding a sudden upturn at the end to represent the <strong>horn</strong>. It's a center line, not the contour.</p>

<p>Adding another center line, which is more curved and almost spherical, from the base up to the bick helps define the form. The contour will make it so we can't see the center line above it. We'll see the contour from the other side and the near convex corner.</p>

<p>Using the analogy of wrapping a <strong>rubber band</strong> around the form helps visualize the contours. The rubber band goes off in one direction, goes vertical, then curves around in the other direction. Adding these lines creates a look of transparency and three-dimensionality, relying only on lines.</p>

<h2>Refining the Drawing</h2>

<p>We proceed to refine the top curve, a straight line that makes a significant curve, aiming down at the midsection transverse plane. It's a <strong>ZY vector</strong>, aiming straight down and then curving.</p>

<p>Looking at the front, the plane aims down and out a little, then more severely. Placing a cross-contour line, a <strong>Y line</strong> that's a portion of an <strong>XY vector</strong> or <strong>coronal plane</strong>, helps define this.</p>

<p>We know that if the foot were right-angled, it would aim back accordingly, but since it's curved, we adjust. Drawing the feet on the ground and adjusting curves helps establish the footprint.</p>

<p>By running lines straight down and choosing a plane from which it splits, we define the sides. We can <strong>curve</strong> or <strong>chisel</strong> as needed, using straights to guide curves and vice versa.</p>

<p>Adding curves and cross-contours conveys depth and form. Darkening the base with bits of atmospheric perspective extends proportions and gives the drawing a mature look.</p>

<h2>Finalizing the Drawing</h2>

<p>At the risk of being a bad influence, I decided to rescue my <strong>line quality</strong>. While one should ideally live with compromised line quality as a learning experience, refining lines can enhance the drawing.</p>

<p>Using a kneaded eraser, I cleaned up the drawing, emphasizing curves and plane breaks. Heavying up the baseline, which sits on the floor, adds weight and solidity.</p>

<p>By making clean lines, ensuring clarity, and thinking through each part, we've created a drawing of the anvil that's both accurate and expressive.</p>

<p>I'm going to scan the drawing now, and you'll have the high-res version to look at and say, "Oh gosh, I can do better than that."</p>
