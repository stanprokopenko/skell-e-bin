<h2>What's in Premium?</h2>

<p>In this lesson, we explore how to build color and lighting in digital portraits. Starting with a merged base layer, we apply local colors to the skin and hair using the <strong>color layer mode</strong>, adjusting saturation and experimenting with different layer modes like <strong>multiply</strong>, <strong>overlay</strong>, and <strong>vivid light</strong>.</p>

<p>To add depth, we introduce color variations on <strong>multiply layers</strong>â€”adding reds to the ears and nose, yellows to the forehead, and cooler tones to the shadows. We refine the painting by focusing on lights and darks, using the smudge tool sparingly to maintain defined values.</p>

<p>We cover adding specular highlights with a <strong>screen layer mode</strong> to emphasize shininess on areas like the eyelids, nose, and lips. Incorporating rim light enhances the lighting effect by following the contours of the face. We utilize subsurface scattering with a <strong>color dodge layer</strong>, adding saturated reds to areas where light passes through thin skin, creating a glowy effect.</p>

<p>Finally, we add subtle skin textures such as freckles or beauty spots using a <strong>multiply layer</strong>, adjusting opacity for subtlety. Throughout the lesson, we focus on ensuring the colors and values work together to bring the portrait to life.</p>
