<p>Hey everybody, welcome back! Today, I'm going to be doing <strong>Value Composition Thumbnails Level Two</strong>. I'll start with this lady, I'm not sure if she's begging or trying to convince somebody of something. The way we compose our values will affect how this piece feels. Maybe if it's a little darker, or the way we crop it, can make her feel even smaller and more vulnerable. Alternatively, it could potentially make her feel larger. We'll see, it might have an effect on the story.</p>

<p>I'll begin with markers and then, after I pick a thumbnail I like, I'll do a larger one on the side using pencils. The markers will help me get through the little thumbnails quickly so I can iterate faster. Then I'll move on to the bigger one with pencils so I can have more control and design the shapes.</p>

<h2>Materials</h2>

<p>I'll probably use a <strong>9</strong> and a <strong>5 marker</strong>, and I'll use the <strong>white of the paper as a third value</strong>. For the pencils, I'll use a <strong>6B</strong>, <strong>HB</strong>, and <strong>4H</strong> to get a wide range and help me separate my values.</p>

<h2>Starting the First Thumbnail</h2>

<p>I start with a clean rectangle, pretty small thumbnail. The photo is a bit squared off, but maybe that's okay. For my first thumbnail, I usually stick to the photo, so I can just learn about it, not experimenting too much just yet.</p>

<p>I'm trying to simplify and abstract her shape into a simple form that fits in here and captures her pose. She's got a lot of space above her head, and I definitely want to keep that for now. She's also really close to the border on the right.</p>

<p>When I squint, I see that the <strong>face is the brightest</strong>. There are also the <strong>tips of the fingers</strong> that are pretty bright, and they're tiny shapes. Together, these little light dots create a lighter area. I'll probably abstract that into just a small light shape to represent the light.</p>

<p>There's a lot of <strong>middle values</strong> going down her dress, like the necklace hanging off. It feels light, but when I squint, it's actually much darker than the light on her face. There are also folds and stripes down the front, but I feel that's a distraction. I'm going to focus on the face and the hands as the light areas, and represent everything else as a big dark shape of her body.</p>

<p>I notice that the background is all mid-value. She has a cast shadow on the wall behind her. I could make the background a light value and the cast shadow a mid-value, or merge the shadow with the background. For this thumbnail, I'll go with what I see as more true to the reference, which is mid-value, and the only light values are her face and hands.</p>

<h2>Second Thumbnail: Adding the Cast Shadow</h2>

<p>In the second thumbnail, I'm going to change one thing: I'll include the <strong>dark cast shadow</strong> on the wall as a dark mass and merge it with her body.</p>

<p>I start with her dark shape to ensure I get it correct. Simple but accurate is the way to go in these thumbnails, but simplicity over accuracy. I include the light shapes for her face and hands again.</p>

<p>Now, on the side, she is casting a shadow on the wall. I'll add that as a dark shape behind her, merging it with her body. This creates an almost <strong>yin-yang</strong> composition, you have a diagonal across the image where most of the canvas on the right is mid-value, and on the left is that dark value. Along the border, you have a little bit of light.</p>

<p>I can adjust the shapes to control the balance. I could bring the dark all the way up to get a real clear, clean diagonal, but I kind of want it to still feel like an organic shadow.</p>

<h2>Third Thumbnail: Experimenting with a Light Background</h2>

<p>In the third thumbnail, I'm going to make it a little lighter overall. I'll go with a <strong>white background</strong> and a <strong>mid-value cast shadow</strong>. I might even bring in some of the <strong>lights on the dress</strong> to see how that looks.</p>

<p>I keep the same crop but now, instead of the background being mid-value, it's light. This changes how the hands interact with the background. The darks under her hands will pop from the background, not the light fingertips, they'll blend in with the background.</p>

<p>I like how the light pattern on the folds creates a diagonal, curving across. I include some mid-values to represent the lit drapery.</p>

<p>I also add a mid-value cast shadow behind her. This creates an interesting effect, but I'm not sure if I like the drapery lit up. It might be stronger if I fill all that in or, in a larger painting, keep those details but as another value that's much darker than mid-value.</p>

<h2>Fourth Thumbnail: Adjusting the Crop and Composition</h2>

<p>In the fourth thumbnail, I play with the cropping a bit. I try a wider composition, maybe a perfect square or slightly wider. I'll keep her on the far left but make her a mid-value figure with a dark background.</p>

<p>I start by making the background dark. Because of this, I make the mid-tones of her face, and her hair stays dark. Her hands need to be mid-value to stand out against the dark background. I bring all of that necklace back into the light, as if it's shining directly onto it.</p>

<p>This composition feels very different. She's now a lighter shape in a darker environment, making her feel more angelic. But because the environment is darker, it might end up feeling a little scarier, instead of a mysterious figure in the shadows, it's an innocent person in a darker, scarier environment. Maybe that contrast is kind of nice.</p>

<h2>Fifth Thumbnail: Introducing a Large Cast Shadow</h2>

<p>In the fifth thumbnail, I create a wider composition, giving more space behind her and less in front. I make the cast shadow a star player, possibly showing danger coming from the front that we don't see.</p>

<p>I put her slightly forward from the center, and draw her shape. The cast shadow starts shorter than her, but I feel the shadow should be more significant, so I make it bigger, even taller than her. I also add a dark shape above her, which is interesting, it could represent something looming over her.</p>

<p>This composition feels strong because it's so different from the others. It's the only one where she's a light figure. However, it feels less about her and more about the environment, and I prefer it to be more of a large portrait where she's the main figure.</p>

<h2>Selecting the Best Thumbnail</h2>

<p>Now I have to make the hard decision about which one I like the most. I don't like the wide ones as much as the tall ones, although the fourth one is pretty strong. It feels strong because it's different, but I think it's between the first two and the last one.</p>

<p>The benefit of the wall being mid-tone is that the face and hands are the only light shapes, which is a really strong strategy for bringing attention to those areas. The strength of the one with the light background is that the dark silhouette feels darker because the background is mostly light.</p>

<p>I decide to adjust the third thumbnail by making the overall tones darker. Instead of all white, I make the background a slightly darker light and darken the cast shadow. This way, I still have the background and the face and hands as the lighter value, but everything's dimmed down. I also add the wall ending and the shadow behind it, similar to what I did in the second thumbnail.</p>

<p>By doing this, I feel like this is my favorite now. It's all subjective, of course, but I'm going to go with this one. I'm going to add a fourth value with the light of the face being even lighter, and if while I'm working on it I feel like I want a fifth value, I have that option.</p>

<h2>Creating the Larger Drawing with Four Values</h2>

<p>I'm moving on to the larger drawing now. I'm going to do pencils, and it's going to be a lot of shading. I have my 6B, HB, and 4H pencils, giving me a very wide range to help me separate my values.</p>

<h3>Establishing the Shapes</h3>

<p>I get these shapes in, still trying to keep it abstract, big abstract shapes for her figure. There's her face, it might be a little too large, but I can always cut into it. It's easier to make a light shape smaller by darkening around it.</p>

<p>I keep the fingers abstract. I don't want to draw an anatomically accurate hand here as I'm exploring composition. I'm keeping it simple so I can modify it quickly.</p>

<p>I include the shape of the cast shadow, making it a bigger element. I adjust the shape of the wall, making it thinner to represent the edge.</p>

<h3>Establishing the Value Range</h3>

<p>I like establishing my full value range early. I have five values:</p>

<ol>

<li><strong>Very Dark</strong>: The darkest areas, like her hair and the deepest shadows.</li>

<li><strong>Dark</strong>: Dark areas within the folds of her dress.</li>

<li><strong>Mid-Value</strong>: The cast shadow on the wall, the side of her face that's in shadow.</li>

<li><strong>Light Mid-Value</strong>: The wall and some parts of the face and skin.</li>

<li><strong>White</strong>: Reserved for the face and a few highlights on the fingertips.</li>

</ol>

<p>I start by filling in the darkest areas with the 6B pencil, and make sure the shapes are clean and sharp. I include pure blacks in the features on her face, the eyes, nostrils, corners of the lips.</p>

<h3>Adding the Mid-Values</h3>

<p>Next, I move on to the mid-values using the HB pencil. I fill in the shadowed areas of her face, the cast shadow on the wall, and parts of her hands. I make sure there's a clear separation between this mid-value and the darker areas.</p>

<p>I also use the 4H pencil for the lighter mid-values, filling in the wall and lighter areas of her face and skin.</p>

<h3>Adjusting the Values</h3>

<p>Now that I have the main values established, I can adjust them. I decide to darken the cast shadow, making it more prominent. I also darken the bottom area, removing contrast between the background and the bottom part of the dress.</p>

<p>I add a fifth value by introducing slight variations within the wall and the dress, to help guide the viewer's eye and maintain focus on her face and hands.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p>I'm coming to the end here. It's not much different from the photo, a few key changes. I darkened the whole bottom area, made the cast shadow more prominent, added the wall, and removed a lot of the detail on the dress. This brought more focus to her face and hands.</p>

<p>I started with a photo I really liked, so I'm not surprised that many of the things I tried that were very different didn't stick. I already had a pretty good vision and was mostly set on the effect or mood of the photo itself, just improving a little bit to focus more on her.</p>

<p>That's it for this session! It turned out much longer than I thought it would, but it was a lot of fun, and I hope you learned a lot. I'm going to do one more, and then we'll move on to critiques. See you guys later!</p>
