<h2>What's in Premium?</h2>

<p>In this lesson, we tackle the challenge of drawing figures from different angles without relying on references. Starting with simple shapes and stick figures, we'll build a foundation to establish poses and spatial relationships. You'll practice sketching the same figure from various perspectives, using gesture lines and cross-contours to communicate three-dimensional form. We'll discuss how to recognize weaknesses, iterate on your sketches, and separate the processes of sketching, thumbnailing, and drawing. By the end, you'll have strategies to build your visual library and draw figures more confidently from any angle.</p>
