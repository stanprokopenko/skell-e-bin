<h2>What's in Premium?</h2>

<p>In this premium lesson, we break down the anatomy and structure of the ear to help you draw it accurately. You'll learn how to place and proportion the ear on the head using the Loomis method, aligning the top of the ear with the brow line and the base with the base of the nose.</p>

<p>We simplify the ear's complex forms into basic shapes, starting with hook shapes representing the helix and antihelix. Step-by-step instructions guide you through blocking in the ear using straights and curves for structure.</p>

<p>You'll become familiar with the key anatomical parts—helix, antihelix, tragus, antitragus, triangular fossa, concha, and earlobe—and how they relate to each other. The lesson includes demonstrations of drawing the ear from different angles—front, back, and profile—using reference images. Tips are provided on capturing the ear's unique shapes and landmarks from each perspective.</p>

<p>By the end, you'll have a solid understanding of ear anatomy and practical techniques for drawing it from various viewpoints.</p>
