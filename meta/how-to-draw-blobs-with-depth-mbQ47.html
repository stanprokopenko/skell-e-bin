<h2>Why Blobs</h2>

<p>You’re going to do a stress-free exercise to practice shading form and focus on <strong>edges</strong>. There’s no right or wrong. You try things out and see the effects. You’ll draw blobs and shade them to see how different edges change how the forms feel.</p>

<h2>Set Up Your Blobs</h2>

<p>Start by drawing a collage of <strong>ellipses</strong>, <strong>ovals</strong>, and <strong>blobby eggs</strong> in various sizes and proportions. Keep it loose. It’s very two-dimensional at first, but you can quickly make it feel 3D with a few tools you already know.</p>

<h3>Make It Feel 3D</h3>

<p>Use these to push it into three dimensions:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Overlaps.</strong> Decide what is in front and what is behind. Put the front forms overlapping the back ones. You can even add a little wrinkle or compression where they meet. If you reverse the overlaps, it just feels like the viewer is on the other side. Still correct.</li>

<li><strong>Cross-contour lines.</strong> Wrap lines around the forms to reveal direction and curvature. They don’t have to be perfect cylinders. You can indicate subtle <strong>planes</strong> if a blob has a little corner.</li>

<li><strong>Diminution.</strong> Things get smaller as they go back. A sequence of forms decreasing in size suggests depth. Overlaps will confirm it.</li>

</ul>

<p>Organic forms are forgiving. You don’t need perfect perspective or vanishing points.</p>

<h2>Add Shadows and Focus on Edges</h2>

<p>This is where it gets super 3D. You’ll focus purely on the <strong>edge of the shadow</strong>. Not ball shading with all the reflected lights and highlights. Just the edge quality.</p>

<h3>Decide the Light</h3>

<p>Pick a general light direction. For example, from the top and a little in front. Then:</p>

<p>1) <strong>Mass in the shadow shapes.</strong> Invent the general shadow areas. Keep it loose at first.

2) <strong>Clean up silhouettes.</strong> Use <strong>sharp edges</strong> around the outer shapes. Don’t worry about atmosphere or lost edges for this exercise.

3) <strong>Clarify inside edges.</strong> Where one form ends and another starts, make that edge sharp if it’s an abrupt connection.</p>

<p>You can put a darker, thicker line on the <strong>shadow side</strong>. It’s less distracting there. On the <strong>light side</strong>, keep outlines lighter. This comes from the line weight lessons.</p>

<h2>Tools, Texture, and Cleanup</h2>

<p>Use what you’re comfortable with. A <strong>charcoal pencil</strong> can make edge control easier. A <strong>kneaded eraser</strong> and a <strong>pencil eraser</strong> help carve sharp edges. If you’re using <strong>graphite</strong> and the shadow mass looks textured:</p>

<ul>

<li>Define the shape with the tip, then fill the shadow more evenly to remove white specks. Clean shapes make edge adjustments easier.</li>

<li>You can lightly even out texture with your finger or a smudge stick.</li>

</ul>

<p>Don’t let heavy construction lines compete with your forms. Lighten or remove them so the illusion reads clearly.</p>

<h2>Shape the Form With Edge Quality</h2>

<p>The edge of a <strong>form shadow</strong> is created by the roundness or hardness of the form. You decide:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Softer edge</strong> feels rounder, like a big ball.</li>

<li><strong>Firmer or sharp edge</strong> feels boxier or has a sudden plane change.</li>

</ul>

<p>You can vary edge quality along a single shadow:</p>

<ul>

<li>Near the top, keep it a bit firmer.</li>

<li>As the form turns away from the light toward the bottom, make the edge <strong>extremely soft</strong> and the value slightly darker.</li>

</ul>

<p>You can go back and re-sharpen parts of the edge where you want it to feel more precise.</p>

<h2>Halftones Are Also About Edges</h2>

<p>Add <strong>halftone shapes</strong> on the light side to reveal more form. Do not mindlessly scribble. Think in shapes and <strong>gradations</strong>:</p>

<ul>

<li>Place a halftone as a shape, then gradate it to describe the edge and plane change.</li>

<li>You can suggest a subtle plane with a firmer or softer halftone edge depending on how you want it to feel.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Cast Shadows Make It Pop</h2>

<p>Cast shadows are <strong>crisp and sharp</strong>. Add them to make the forms jump:</p>

<ul>

<li>From a top light, drop sharp cast shadows down and to the side.</li>

<li>Those sharp interior edges will stand out against your softer form edges and make the forms pop.</li>

</ul>

<p>Don’t obsess over perfect light direction accuracy. Get it close. Focus more on how your <strong>edges</strong> and <strong>planes</strong> affect the form. You can cheat light and perspective. If it looks like a plane change, the viewer will believe you.</p>

<h2>A Quick Way to Explore</h2>

<p>You can stumble into convincing form fast:</p>

<ul>

<li>Pick a blob. Choose one edge to be <strong>firm</strong> to suggest a sudden plane change.</li>

<li>Make another edge <strong>soft</strong> to slow into the plane change.</li>

<li>Add a small halftone gradation to suggest a plane, even if the light direction is not perfect.</li>

<li>Clean up texture if it fights the illusion.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Apply This to Previous Projects</h2>

<p>Go back to your <strong>ginger root</strong> and <strong>cross-contour on organic forms</strong> projects. You already set up the 3D forms with line. Now:</p>

<ul>

<li>Pick a light source.</li>

<li>Place the shadow shapes.</li>

<li>Decide edge quality for each form shadow based on your cross contours.</li>

<li>Add halftones with intentional edges where helpful.</li>

</ul>

<p>If you don’t want to draw over the originals, redraw them and shade on top.</p>

<h2>Assignment</h2>

<ul>

<li><strong>Level 1:</strong> Invent blobs and shade them. There’s no right or wrong. Include variety. Some forms should have <strong>sharper corners</strong>, others should be <strong>very round and soft</strong>. Focus on clean silhouettes, clear shadow shapes, and intentional edge control.</li>

<li><strong>Level 2:</strong> A more challenging version is in the next video. Do the Level 1 blobs first to get comfortable.</li>

</ul>

<p>Get blobbing. Experiment. See how edge decisions change how your forms feel.</p>
