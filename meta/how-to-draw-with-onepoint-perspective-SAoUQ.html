<h2>Setting Up the Perspective Grid</h2>

<p>I begin by setting up a <strong>one-point perspective grid</strong>. Getting this grid right is crucial because it determines how foreshortened the airplane will appear. I make sure the grid extends far enough to accommodate the wings and other parts of the plane. Including more grid lines than you think you'll need can be very helpful.</p>

<h2>Sketching the Basic Structure</h2>

<p>Next, I <strong>divide the airplane's body into three parts</strong>. The first two sections are equal, while the last section is longer. Estimating these proportions isn't easy, even for me, but it's essential for accuracy.</p>

<p>I draw <strong>vertical lines</strong> to establish the corners of the plane's body. Then, I create a <strong>right-angled box</strong> in one-point perspective with a square front. This box serves as the basic structure of the airplane.</p>

<h2>Adding the Dome</h2>

<p>I focus on the front of the plane, which has a dome. I find the <strong>center of the front face</strong> and sketch an ellipse to represent the dome. If you're a beginner, don't worry if this seems tricky, you'll learn how to place that dome in time. For now, just give it your best estimate.</p>

<h2>Drawing the Tail</h2>

<p>Moving to the back of the plane, I sketch the tail. The tail rises <strong>significantly higher than the top of the dome</strong>. Remember, the height of the tail isn't foreshortened since it's vertical, it diminishes in size due to perspective but doesn't tilt.</p>

<p>I find the <strong>center area on the back plane</strong> and estimate how far forward the tail comes, about a third of the way. I draw vertical lines to represent the tail's side planes, which are extremely thin because of the foreshortening.</p>

<h2>Adding the Stabilizing Wings</h2>

<p>Next, I add the <strong>stabilizing wings</strong>. They run right across the <strong>top plane</strong> of the tail section. Starting from the top of the back plane, I estimate their width to be about the same as the height of the tail. I draw them as rectangular wings first and then refine their shapes. Remember, these wings are <strong>slightly angled</strong> due to the perspective.</p>

<h2>Drawing the Main Wings</h2>

<p>The <strong>main wings</strong> extend back to the vanishing point, which makes them appear highly foreshortened. This can look odd at first, but <strong>trust the grid</strong>, it guides the perspective accurately.</p>

<p>I find the <strong>base of the wings</strong> on the body and draw them outwards, ensuring they align with the perspective lines. These wings will appear extremely angled due to the one-point perspective, which is perfectly normal.</p>

<h2>Finalizing the Drawing</h2>

<p>With the basic shapes in place, I go back and <strong>darken the important lines</strong>, adjusting as necessary. Sometimes, I use a straight edge to clean up lines, and that's perfectly fine. <strong>Precision is important</strong>, but if something doesn't look right, trust your eye over the instruments.</p>

<p>I lightly <strong>erase construction lines</strong> that are no longer needed. For the dome and other curved elements, I might use templates, or freehand them if I'm feeling confident. Don't worry if your ellipses aren't perfect, they'll improve with practice.</p>

<p>In the end, I have a drawing of an airplane in proper one-point perspective, with all parts proportioned and positioned accurately. <strong>Remember</strong>, it's all about starting with a solid grid, establishing your basic shapes, and refining from there. Now, give it a try yourself!</p>
