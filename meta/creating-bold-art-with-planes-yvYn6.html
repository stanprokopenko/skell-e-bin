<p><strong>Planes</strong> are essential in painting and drawing as they describe changes in direction on a form. They create shapes that mimic the structure of the head, providing a <strong>sculptural feel</strong>. Carved planes give a solid feel and make value changes more obvious compared to rounded edges. This approach helps in creating artwork that is structured and bold, rather than soft and vague.</p>

<h2>The Asaro Head as a Visual Aid</h2>

<p>The <strong>Asaro head</strong> is a valuable tool for artists. It demonstrates how planes work in art, helping artists visualize and understand the structure of the head. By studying the Asaro head, artists can better grasp how to apply planes in their work, enhancing the overall form and structure.</p>

<h2>Choosing Subjects with Visible Planes</h2>

<p>When selecting subjects for drawing or painting, it's important to choose those with <strong>defined facial planes</strong>. For example, subjects with visible planes on the forehead and cheekbones are ideal. These features provide clear direction changes that can be emphasized in the artwork, contributing to a more structured and sculptural result.</p>

<h2>Enhancing Planes in Artistic Work</h2>

<p>Artists can use <strong>artistic license</strong> to enhance planes for more direction change. For instance, even if a photo shows a flat forehead, an artist might choose to exaggerate the planes to create more depth. Additionally, when drawing hair, it's effective to chunk it into planes, giving it a sculptural quality that adds to the overall structure of the piece.</p>

<h2>Creating Sculptural Drawings and Paintings</h2>

<p>The goal in drawing and painting is to achieve <strong>form and structure</strong>. This means avoiding soft and vague representations and instead aiming for boldness that resembles a beautiful sculpture. This approach ensures that the artwork has a strong presence and conveys a sense of solidity.</p>

<h2>Influence of Fred Fixer</h2>

<p>My teacher, <strong>Fred Fixer</strong>, had a significant influence on my approach to art. He emphasized drawing as if a sculptor would use it to create a model. This means indicating structural details in drawings is crucial for a sculptor's understanding. The drawings should reflect something useful for a sculptor, showing steps and form.</p>

<h2>Avoiding Vague and Linear Drawings</h2>

<p>To create effective artwork, it's important to avoid vague, soft, or overly linear drawings. Instead, aim for <strong>tonal work</strong> that shows form. This approach ensures that the drawings are useful for a sculptor, providing clear indications of steps and form.</p>

<h2>Incorporating Planes into Artistic Vocabulary</h2>

<p>Understanding and incorporating <strong>planes</strong> into your artistic vocabulary adds depth to your work. Even details should be thought of as small planes, contributing to the overall structure. This understanding enriches the artist's ability to create structured and sculptural artwork.</p>
