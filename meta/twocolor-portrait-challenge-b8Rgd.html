<h2>Finalizing the Painting</h2>

<p>I returned to the studio after some rest to review the painting from last night. I consider it complete for this demonstration. I'm satisfied with the face and the overall painting, but I contemplated adding a few color notes in the background for interest. Before moving to the next lesson, I wanted to finalize the painting while it's still wet, as I don't plan to revisit it.</p>

<h2>Choice of Reference</h2>

<p>I explained the choice of reference for this beginner painting, aiming to help students select subjects for their own work. It's important to choose a subject that can guide the learning process effectively.</p>

<h2>Enhancing the Painting</h2>

<p>I noticed a suggestion of a shape in the painting's corner, which I decided to enhance for an abstract feel. I aimed to be transparent about every step, adding color notes to the background for interest. I used a large brush, despite disliking ordering art supplies, and mentioned the high cost of materials. I experimented with brighter notes in the painting's corner, mixing colors like ketchup and mustard to create an orange note. I tapped yellow ocher onto black to create a green hue.</p>

<h2>Decision-Making Process</h2>

<p>My decision-making process in painting is intuitive and difficult to explain. I sought to add variety by creating a harder edge near the subject's head to avoid uniformity. The painting was created using only two colors, ketchup and mustard, which I found impressive. I mixed green using black and yellow, adding a touch of orange for contrast near the ear. I emphasized the importance of edges in painting, comparing them to musical notes that add variety and interest. <strong>Variety is crucial</strong> to holding a viewer's attention and preventing a painting from being boring.</p>

<h2>Portrait Challenges</h2>

<p>I introduced the model, Ethan Espinosa, a friend and artist, who allowed me to use his likeness for this demo. I discussed the challenge of making a portrait of an unknown person interesting through painting techniques. As a fine artist, I worried about the appeal of portraits of unknown subjects, unlike recognizable figures like Arnold Schwarzenegger. Many artists avoid direct eye contact in portraits to make them more relatable and less specific. I enjoy painting eye contact, treating portraits as historical figures to add significance. The appeal of a portrait lies in how it's painted, not just the subject's identity.</p>

<h2>Adding Emotion and Complexity</h2>

<p>I aimed to make the painting more than just a portrait of Ethan by adding emotion and color. I added pure color to the background to enhance the painting's complexity and challenge the notion of a two-color palette. Limiting the palette forces reliance on fundamental painting tools like shapes, values, edges, and color. I added a sharp edge behind the subject's head to create contrast, despite it not being in the photo. I adjusted the subject's hair to reflect a natural rhythm and style.</p>

<h2>Educational Aspects</h2>

<p>The first lesson involved following stages in painting, with an assignment to document these stages with photos. Skipping stages can lead to issues later in the painting process. The next lesson will involve a different head, with the same assignment of documenting stages.</p>
