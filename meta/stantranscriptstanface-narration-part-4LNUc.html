<p>Whenever I show a tool that provides answers, people often ask, "Is this cheating?" I like to compare these tools to calculators. You can either spend time mastering calculations, or use a calculator for efficiency. It depends on your purpose. If you're in a math class and the rules prohibit calculators, using one is cheating. But if you're checking your answers, it's not cheating, it's feedback. However, if you always rely on the calculator without trying on your own, you are cheating yourself out of improvement.</p>

<p><strong>Contextual Use of Tools</strong></p>

<p>Understanding the context of tool use is crucial. In some jobs, like rocket science or medicine, precision is vital. Here, using a calculator isn't cheating, it's necessary. Similarly, some artists project sketches or photos to ensure perfect proportions. The final result matters more than the process. But remember, precision tools can hinder creativity. If you need creativity, relying too much on precision tools can be limiting.</p>

<p><strong>The Role of Tools in Learning</strong></p>

<p>Tools are for feedback and catching errors early. This prevents bad habits and accelerates improvement. But if you depend on them too much, you miss out on developing your skills. It's about finding a balance. Use tools to develop your eye, but don't let them stifle your creativity.</p>

<p><strong>Precision vs. Creativity</strong></p>

<p>In fields requiring precision, like technical jobs, tools are essential. But in art, precision can limit creativity. You need room to explore and experiment with proportions, values, and colors. Tools should help you see correctly, not confine you to reality's boundaries.</p>

<p><strong>Balancing Tool Use and Artistic Growth</strong></p>

<p>Don't become overly reliant on tools. They should aid, not replace, your creative process. Push and pull your artistic boundaries. Explore beyond precision tools to foster creativity. It's about finding the right balance between using tools and nurturing your artistic growth.</p>
