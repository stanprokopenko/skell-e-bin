<p>In the premium lesson, Ben demonstrates how to stylize portraits by starting with the <strong>largest shapes</strong> and refining down to finer details. He explains how to transition between <strong>2D and 3D thinking</strong> to build depth in your drawings. You'll learn techniques for understanding and simplifying facial features like the <strong>nose</strong>, <strong>ears</strong>, and <strong>eyes</strong>, using basic shapes to capture their forms. Ben shares tips on drawing <strong>hair</strong> as big shapes, managing <strong>eye direction</strong>, and using tools like the <strong>lasso</strong> for quick adjustments. He discusses the benefits of using <strong>style references</strong> to develop your own style and how to push <strong>expressions</strong> by adjusting features. The lesson also covers working in <strong>traditional vs. digital media</strong>, introducing <strong>colors and values</strong>, and refining your drawing for better results.
