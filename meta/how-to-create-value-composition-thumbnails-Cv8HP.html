<h2>Starting with a Basic Thumbnail</h2>

<p>All right, hello everybody. I'm going to be doing some <strong>value composition studies</strong>. In this demo, I'll be using a Level 1 approach. I'm exploring a few <strong>thumbnail variations</strong>.</p>

<p>I usually like to start off with a boring one, just something that's already pretty close to what the photo is. I'm not really exploring too much, I'm just starting off. It can even act as a little warmup.</p>

<p>I don't always use a ruler for my borders, but why not? I feel like I have to make these a little more presentable for you guys.</p>

<p>So I'm not going to play too much with the cropping or the major value groups. I'm just going to take a look at this. I'm going to study the photo as it is and just see what I can do.</p>

<p>Unless I already know going into it, like, "Oh gosh, I really hate how his shirt is so black."] It's so distracting, I want to make it mid-value so it blends in with the background better. If there's something in the photo that I just know I really hate going into it, I could start by changing it. However, that's usually not the case.</p>

<h2>Simplifying Major Shapes</h2>

<p>I start with some <strong>major value groups</strong> and <strong>value shapes</strong>. Down here is this little triangle for the hands or under the hands. I'm not drawing hands, I'm just drawing the big shapes, right? So two wrists, and a big blocky shape for the hand group.</p>

<p>And then up here, kind of squared off in the hair. I can go even simpler than this. I think I'm just getting warmed up a little bit. Even my simplifying muscles are getting warmed up.</p>

<p>So those are the big shapes that I'm seeing. Now, when I squint down, let's see how they are grouped together. The background is definitely a mid-value, right? It's not dark, it's not light, it's right in the middle there. So let's get that in there.</p>

<h2>Filling in the Values</h2>

<p>Now, when I'm filling in these larger areas, I'm not trying to be too clean. Again, I want to get through these fairly quickly, but I don't want to make it so messy that it doesn't feel like one value.</p>

<p>A little bit of texture is fine, but if I'm so messy that my values are all over the place, I'm not communicating the thing that I'm trying to communicate with it. You have to be clear enough but don't waste your time.</p>

<p>Everything else I'm not quite sure about except the shirt is very, very dark. Let's get that in there.</p>

<p>Same thing here, just want to get that thing filled in. You can see why drawing smaller can be beneficial. It's kind of a trade-off. You go too small, and you can't really design your shapes very much. There's just not enough space to draw the shape of these two hands. But if you go too big, you're just wasting so much time filling in all this space.</p>

<p>All right, so that shirt is definitely dark. And now in the face, I'm seeing some darks on the bottom planes and the right plane. So there's this cheek, definitely a lot underneath the chin.</p>

<h2>Connecting and Simplifying Shapes</h2>

<p>I don't like too many floating shapes. When I do a floating shape, I'm usually thinking about it as, "Okay, if this shape is kind of calling for attention, is that okay?" If not, I'll try to find a way to connect it to something else.</p>

<p>If it is fine, like if it's an eye, it's like, "Oh cool, great." It's a floating shape, it'll stand out more. But like all the stuff in the hair, I don't really want it to stand out too much, so connect it to the ear.</p>

<p>See, all this is just one big shape. Simplify it. And that all connects to the dark shape of the shirt.</p>

<p>And then in the hair, I'm seeing some little shadows in there, but I could say, "Well, this little guy over here could just blend in with the background." Or, which I'll try on this first version, I could put a floating shape in here just to kind of frame the head like that.</p>

<p>Now, I need to decide, actually, this is a pretty important decision, do I want the hair and the skin to both be kind of like light and mid-values where the highlights are light and everything else is mid? Or do I want to kind of push the hair lighter overall from the skin, and just leave a few light areas on the skin?</p>

<h2>Evaluating Values and Making Decisions</h2>

<p>When I squint, they're both kind of the same. They both have a very similar local value and a similar range of halftone values.</p>

<p>I guess for this first one, I'm just going to do that, the same thing that I'm seeing here. I see highlights throughout the hair, kind of like a little S pattern. I lose this whole top part into the background, and this is kind of nice. This light pattern in here goes right into the forehead, without really a clear border. So they kind of connect as one little shape. That's kind of nice.</p>

<p>That's cool. I like that S-curve in through here connecting into that.</p>

<h2>Simplifying the Face</h2>

<p>Then in the head, the forehead is definitely quite light, but on the sides, I'm seeing mid-value. Definitely mid-value more at the bottom, like most of it is just mid as it goes down.</p>

<p>The reason I say that is because if you compare it to the light on the forehead, like if you compare the chin and like the top lip, all of that and the cheek to the forehead, it's a bit darker. And then you compare that to the highlights in the hair, it's definitely darker, it's getting pretty close to that background value.</p>

<p>And that's something that you can push, right? You can play with these sorts of things, and I could explore that in other thumbnails that I do. But for now, I'm just going to stay pretty close to what I'm seeing, just exploring it as it is.</p>

<p>Most of this nose is kind of mid-value. Now, I want to be careful that I don't get too detailed. Let's just find the very few dark shapes in here that need to be dark, like the mouth is definitely dark, and it kind of bleeds into this shape under the nose, right? Very simple shape, not much going on.</p>

<p>And then a few darks under the eyebrows. But then, all that other stuff in there might just be a little bit too detailed. They're important shapes, but eventually, you just got to stop and say, "Yeah, it's an important shape, but it's just too small for this thumbnail." It doesn't make a difference. Like as long as I'm showing that, yeah, there's a lot of little shapes in here. Okay, cool. That's enough to say, "Look everybody, there's important stuff here."</p>

<h2>Exploring Variations in Thumbnails</h2>

<p>In the next one, I'm going to do a big jump. I'm going to make the shirt a different value. I want to see if having most of the darks on the head will make it a little bit more interesting. So let's try that.</p>

<h3>Quick Sketching and Simplification</h3>

<p>Really simple shapes. I'm not going to play with the cropping just yet. Big basic shapes. There's the hands.</p>

<p>Okay, so let's try this out. Let's get all of these darks on the head again, dark here, dark here.</p>

<p>Okay, so yeah, very quick. I did that much quicker than the first time around because I don't really care too much about getting the proportions right. I just want to get these little indications in there to see how the different values will affect the way it feels.</p>

<h3>Adjusting Values in the Shirt</h3>

<p>Now, it's kind of hard to see, but within the shirt, there are shadows. The whole thing looks like a dark shadow, but if I make that shirt white or light gray, there are going to be shadows within the shirt.</p>

<p>For example, on the collar, there's a shadow inside here and a little bit here. See a little one coming up. So if I make the shirt light, this stuff is still going to be there.</p>

<p>And then the hands are going to cast a shadow. Now, I don't need to make these black. I could make the shirt white. I think I'll do that. I'll make the shirt white, and then all the little shadows kind of below the collar are going to be a mid-value.</p>

<p>And I can also just kind of lose it into the background, right? Like you've seen little vignettes where you have the details but then just like slowly disappear.</p>

<p>There's definitely darks around this area. Yeah, there's darks in here between the arm and the chest, but I feel like that's a distraction. I feel like at that point, I could just make it disappear into the background.</p>

<h3>Focusing on the Face</h3>

<p>All I really care about is getting some of these major shapes in here to show that this is a hand, but I don't want to bring the contrast down here. This is what I'm trying as a kind of a variation off of this one, keeping the contrast between pure white and black up here, and then everything below that is going to be mid-value and white.</p>

<p>Okay, so those are the little shapes that I would put in. And then a lot of the stuff in here would be really, really subtle. If I were to blow it up, make it a big version, I'd keep it really subtle.</p>

<p>I mean, I'm seeing a lot of darks between the fingers, but I would make those much lighter and maybe even keep it almost entirely just like a linear drawing of the hands. Just like a little bit of these values, like here and here, kind of tone it in.</p>

<p>Do kind of like an Eliza Ivanova, you see her using the blending stump to kind of get a large area of mid-tone in, and then a lot of linear elements in there to outline the kind of a drawing of a hand but not the values of the hand.</p>

<p>All the tonal rendering of the light and the shadows and the highlights, all of that we can keep up here and bring the attention back over here.</p>

<h3>Adjusting the Background</h3>

<p>I haven't decided yet what the background is going to be actually. That could also be mostly white. I think I want to put a dark shape behind him. I don't know what kind of shape it will be, but it's nice to connect this hair to it.</p>

<p>And then I don't want to just do the same thing over here, I kind of want to make it dynamic. And I already have a shadow on the right side of his head, it kind of frames his face. So I don't need to put that shadow here.</p>

<p>This shadow is nice because it frames his face, it makes this edge very clear and provides even more contrast between the lights and the background in this area.</p>

<p>So now maybe in here, I'll make this shape a little more horizontal, right? So that kind of makes it a little off-balance, helps with the tilt of his head, kind of goes with it a little bit. I mean, yeah, I kind of like that. It works.</p>

<p>And you see, I changed a lot. Like, you can stray away from the photo this much. I mean, this is what it's all about, right? You're exploring, you're making your own decisions as an artist. You're not stuck as like a slave to the photo that you've been either given or that you chose, you can do whatever you want.</p>

<p>But yeah, I kind of like that as an option.</p>

<h2>Exploring Lightness of Hair</h2>

<p>Let's keep going. Let's see, what do I want to do next? Okay, I want to play with the idea that his hair is very light, right? Definitely white. I mean, there's a little bit of silver in there, but it's much lighter than most people's hair. So that's kind of a distinct quality about him.</p>

<p>So in order to make it feel lighter, I need to put dark around it. So let's get that lay-in in there again.</p>

<h3>Making the Background Dark</h3>

<p>Now, I don't know what I'm going to do with the shirt yet, so I'm just going to plop it in real quick. There's his hands.</p>

<p>Okay, let's just make the entire background black. And there's many things I could have done here. I didn't have to make the entire background black. I could have just put some kind of shape up here around the hair that is black, and then the rest could have stayed mid-value.</p>

<p>So as you do these thumbnails, if you've run out of ideas, you're like, "I don't know what else to explore." You're just not thinking outside the box enough. There's always more options you can try, things you can change, a different way to crop it. There's too many to really explore all of them. So you have to decide what you want to play with. You have to have an opinion.</p>

<h3>Adjusting Skin and Shirt Values</h3>

<p>So that clearly now doesn't just frame his hair, it frames his whole head actually. So, in order to really make it about his hair, I'm going to have to make most of his skin in here darker in the mid-value. So taking away some of these highlights, maybe.</p>

<p>Now if I keep the shirt white, there's going to be too much contrast in here potentially unless I do this, but that's weird, and I feel like it'd be really weird if I have all this dark everywhere and then suddenly after this border, everything becomes just light and medium. There's no transition to that fade out.</p>

<p>So I think I'm going to make his shirt more of a mid. And that mid-value I'll also think is just a little bit too light. So I'm going in there and darkening it even more.</p>

<p>The reason is because the darker I make this mid-value, the more this light will stand out even more. It'll be like that rare light value, surrounded by all this dark. So I'm making this more of a <strong>low-key drawing</strong>. This is a <strong>high-key drawing</strong>, most of this is light. This is mostly going to be now dark and mid, but the mid is pushed towards the darks as well.</p>

<h3>Keeping Full Value Range</h3>

<p>And so far all of these have been full range from white to black. I haven't really played with the range at all, and I don't feel like I really even care to in this one because I really like the contrast, the lighting on his face. I like how the shadows are really dark, and I like how his hair is light, and so taking one of those away I feel like would not make it better.</p>

<p>So that's why I'm not really playing with the range in this one. You don't always have to limit your range. You can just reorganize where they are.</p>

<h3>Adjusting Darks and Lights</h3>

<p>So there's that, and then let's put some more mid-values back up here. And actually, let's get a few of those darks within the hands. There's this dark, and there's a shadow over here.</p>

<p>I almost want to put more shadow throughout the shirt area, like around the corners, because I don't want these floaters, these floating shadows around here. I definitely want the hands to kind of pop from the shirt a little bit, but I don't want them to be floating like this because I'm not fading them out.</p>

<p>I just realized these shadow shapes that I'm putting in here for the sleeves, they do a pretty good job of leading our eye up. It's a triangle overall that points up to his face. So this going up, this going up.</p>

<h3>Emphasizing Light in the Hair</h3>

<p>And now I'm going to make the hair lighter. So the way to do that is to make some of these halftone shapes smaller, as if we're kind of moving that threshold more and more. So more and more of the darker halftones start to become part of the light, and so each of these shapes just gets smaller and smaller. I'm only keeping the absolute darkest halftones.</p>

<p>And then for the face, I think I'm going to try making it mostly halftone except a little piece of the forehead and maybe a little bit in the cheeks, but not much. I'm just going to try to put most of this in halftone, see how it goes.</p>

<h3>Adjusting Values in the Hands</h3>

<p>I mean, it is interesting. I actually just realized the hands need to be completely mid-value, like they should not stick out more than the face.</p>

<p>Yeah, okay, this is interesting. It's not my favorite, but it could totally work. If I blow this up and I start introducing more subtle value variations within here and within here, this could work. Like, I don't hate it.</p>

<p>It is a little bit busy here though with so many little shapes. I feel like I need to simplify some of this. Maybe just remove this shadow completely. It would just be a very subtle indication of it in the details, but overall there wouldn't be a major value separation.</p>

<p>And notice how dull this pencil is. It's going to be easier for me to draw large shapes. Don't want to omit the dark shapes from here. I'm just getting rid of most of the highlights, but the darks need to stay. So let's get those in there.</p>

<p>Yeah, I don't hate it. I know that when I start actually rendering this, I'm going to introduce a lot more light throughout some of these areas like that. Yeah, that works.</p>

<h2>Focusing on the Hands</h2>

<p>Now, I do want to try another one where it's mostly about the hands. I'm not sure how to do that. I mean, obviously bringing contrast into the hands, but I don't want to make the face feel like it's not important because it's a portrait, you can't just knock the portrait back. So let's see what we can do.</p>

<p>And I'm still not playing with cropping, which I'm kind of disappointed in myself that I'm just going with the same thing over and over again. I'll do that maybe in the next one. I'll just do one more after this, and I'll try to crop it slightly differently. I'll maybe pick one of my favorites from these and then try to crop it different.</p>

<h3>Adjusting Values to Emphasize Hands</h3>

<p>So one very obvious way to do this is to make the hands very light against dark, but I kind of already have that. This is kind of what this is, right?</p>

<p>If I do that, I don't think I would change much because what else would I be able to change? The background? Make that lighter? Because if I do that, then actually these shadows around here become more contrasty.</p>

<p>I'm going to try a different thing. I'm going to do mid-value for the shirt. So that way I can put some of these darks around it, around the light, and then maybe I don't put much shadow up here. Maybe I keep mostly the darks around here, or maybe I just remove the shadow from this side. So it's mostly shadow here, but this fades out. So this shadow actually would act as a way to point down to the hands.</p>

<h3>Experimenting with Shapes and Values</h3>

<p>Okay, this could work. Let's get that mid-value for the shirt. There's no way to know unless we just try it out.</p>

<p>Right, like this works okay. I think this might work a little bit better if I put a little bit of light on the hands as well.</p>

<p>Okay, so there's that. I'm going to start by putting these shadows up here in the hair and the face as the mids and seeing how that looks because I do have that option still of just limiting my range of values in here to only up to maybe starting from a 3 or 4 all the way to a 10.</p>

<p>Of course, there was also that option of just making the background and the shirt black, making it more of a Rembrandt type of thing where there's only two shapes of light in the whole thing, and that's, you know, the head mass and the hands, right? There's just two masses of light. Everything else is dark. I didn't want to do that. It just felt too obvious.</p>

<p>I just wanted to play around with some of these other variations that I wasn't really sure about.</p>

<h3>Adjusting Contrast and Shapes</h3>

<p>So this is all mid, and now let's put some of these blacks in here. Definitely want that contrast.</p>

<p>I don't know how much though, like how far do we take this black? Do we go all the way to the corners or keep it within here? Because that shape right here just looks wrong. It's like, why do we have so much contrast down here but not up here, right? It just feels wrong. That doesn't work.</p>

<p>I wonder if instead of doing that we can just play with something else. So let's put a dark shape up here. I'm just exploring, right? If it fails, so what? I could do another one, or I could pick one of these other ones to do larger. So let's just explore until it is a little bit better than what I have here.</p>

<p>I definitely want to introduce darks in here. It just feels weird that this is not a shadow, that it's just down here in the hands. But what if I make the hair a little bit darker, right? Like if I make it a little bit darker gray instead of a light gray.</p>

<p>It's not bad, but I think something's off. What if I make the rest of this background mid as well? So we're not focusing on that edge between the shoulders and background as much, right? We lose that contrast completely.</p>

<p>Well, that's interesting. But now, I feel like I need to figure out some kind of dark shape in here. And now I'm just coming up with a shape. This isn't based on the photo at all.</p>

<h3>Creating a Checkerboard Pattern</h3>

<p>Now what if this goes all the way to the side? Okay, this could work. Okay, so now we're going for like a little checkerboard pattern, right? Dark, mid, dark, mid. And actually, let me just fill in this entire thing up here. There.</p>

<p>I think that is stronger. Instead of some shape in the background that wasn't motivated by anything, now this shape at least is cut off at the shoulder. This is cut off at the shoulder.</p>

<p>So I didn't remove the contrast between the shoulder and the background, but it led me to this other kind of checkerboard idea. You've got these grays across from each other and these darks across from each other, and then you have light and light just in this diagonal.</p>

<p>Okay, that can work a little bit.</p>

<h3>Further Variations</h3>

<p>And looking at all of these, there's just so many more to explore from each of these. Like for example, with this one, I would want to explore one where I put some more mids all the way through here, right? Framing a little bit around the hands so that the lights in the hands can pop just a little bit, not a lot. I wouldn't put the dark in here, just the mid-value in here to frame the light of the hand just at the top, and then letting the wrist kind of merge into the background. So that would be one other option.</p>

<p>I'll just do it. These thumbnails should not be precious. If you want to just go in there and try another thing out, you can do it.</p>

<p>Okay, yeah, that works. It's like an interesting shape in here. Mostly diagonal, this whole thing, and then this wrist comes out. So if anything, I would maybe just remove some of this detail.</p>

<h2>Playing with Cropping and Framing</h2>

<p>And then finally I just wanted to do one to play with the framing. I'm not sure how I can change it. There's so many versions. There is a version where I have the head, I have the hands, and I could frame it so that it's more centered around the head. Or I could make it just a little bit taller so that he feels a little bit low.</p>

<h3>Adjusting Composition</h3>

<p>Let's try all these out.</p>

<p>Putting a little bit of space above him kind of drops him down a little bit. A little bit of air to breathe up here, right? Because every time I was putting this really close, I felt like, "Oh my God, it's so close to the edge." Felt strange.</p>

<p>I mean, I know it's centering between the two focal points, but sometimes I really enjoy a composition that's not balanced, where something is just a little bit too low, a little bit too far to the right. And you're showing this space, and it's like, "What? What's up with that space? Why is it there?" Kind of like that option.</p>

<p>But then there's also the other option, completely the other direction, where you have a head up in the corner still, and you put even more space below him. So now what ended up happening actually is the hands are right in the middle, and that's kind of cool. Yeah, actually, that's interesting. I actually really do like that.</p>

<h3>Adding Gradient and Shapes</h3>

<p>We're adding some space. Now, I'm going to try a different one, where I actually have a gradation across the shirt. So it starts black. I'm not going to actually do a gradation because I know I said let's keep it as hard edges, right? Or did I say that? I don't remember if I actually said it, but I definitely want you to make a choice. I don't want you to make gradations, but we can have this bottom area mid and then have some kind of shape where it ends, it goes from dark to mid.</p>

<p>And that's kind of the point of me telling you to have only hard edges, because you're going to have to choose the shape between dark and mid. Even though later on you might say, "Well, this is just going to be softened," there's still a shape between those soft edges, it's just not as obvious because it's blurred. But a gradation is still just two blurry shapes. So what are those shapes that are blurry in there? That's what you're going to figure out.</p>

<p>In here, is it just straight across, or is it more like triangle like this? Okay, so this goes from dark and then mid down here, and then the background, I think I will make it mid as well.</p>

<p>That's interesting. What if it's just this mid, and you have light and light in here?</p>

<p>Actually, I'm going to make this whole left side more of a mid-value. Actually, I'll even lighten this whole area over here to lose that into the background. That could work.</p>

<p>Another option here, another variation of this would be to have this entire shadow kind of shape back here also go into dark, but I kind of like how we have this shape in here framing the face, providing a little bit more detail and contrast in this area.</p>

<p>Yeah. Okay.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p>So anyway, that's how you would play with the cropping. There's more variations, right? You can make this horizontal. You can just add space on the side. You can make this a square.</p>

<p>So we put the head in the middle. We put the head on the left. We could also add space only on the right.</p>

<p>So if we make it a square, we could either make it a square where we add on both sides, or we can make it a square where we just add over here. And then all of this is kind of empty space where he's looking. That could work as well.</p>

<p>But okay, I've explored this kind of enough. I could go on for a much longer time if I really am going to spend a long time on this portrait, but I think it's good enough to show you guys how you can take this into so many different directions.</p>

<p>I'm just going to move on to the next one.</p>
