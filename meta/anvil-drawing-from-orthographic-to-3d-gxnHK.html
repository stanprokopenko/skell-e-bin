<p>I started by placing the <strong>horizon line</strong> in the image. To keep the grid subtle, I used two sheets of vellum over it. I chose a <strong>front corner</strong> for the box, marking a point to ensure it stays within the picture. This point determined the <strong>height of the box</strong>.</p>

<p>Knowing the <strong>vanishing points</strong>, I established the three axes needed. I had to decide how <strong>wide</strong> and <strong>deep</strong> the box should be. I aimed for a front rectangle that's <strong>higher than it is wide</strong>. In a wide-angle view, objects closer to us appear narrower due to perspective.</p>

<p>I tested the proportions by running the corners back to the vanishing points. The back rectangle seemed square, but acceptable. This box serves as a guide to place the anvil within it.</p>

<p>Using the <strong>orthographic projection (ortho)</strong>, I found the halfway point. Noting that the base of the anvil extends <strong>in front of the halfway point</strong>, I estimated the position of the back foot. I used the <strong>X method</strong> to find the center, observing how things compress in a wide-angle view.</p>

<p>I constructed the base, a rectangle <strong>deeper than it is wide</strong>. From its center, I lifted a vertical line and this established the height. Being close to the horizon line made side-to-side and front-to-back lines appear nearly the same, but I carefully distinguished them.</p>

<p>Next, I focused on the anvil's <strong>body</strong>. Drawing from the base up to the waist, I used the center line to find the front and back limits. I divided the width into quarters to get the right proportions.</p>

<p>For the <strong>hanging end</strong>, I noted it's about halfway across the base but doesn't reach as far forward as the front foot. I plotted its position, ensuring it aligned correctly in perspective.</p>

<p>The anvil's <strong>horn</strong> extends beyond the halfway point, matching the width of the face. I connected points with straight lines to guide its shape, then transformed them into curves based on the ortho. I added the <strong>step down</strong> and found the center where the horn points.</p>

<p>Using cross-contour lines, I defined the curves of the horn and waist. I paid attention to how lines change direction, aiming down as they move away when above the horizon line. This helped in capturing the anvil's form accurately.</p>

<p>Throughout, I erased unnecessary lines to clean up the drawing. By darkening the lines I wanted to keep, I clarified the anvil's structure. I constantly referred back to the ortho, ensuring symmetry and proportion without directly viewing the anvil in this position.</p>

<p>In the end, I navigated the grid in 3D, constructing the anvil from eye level. This method relies on understanding perspective, using grids and orthographic projections to accurately render complex forms.</p>
