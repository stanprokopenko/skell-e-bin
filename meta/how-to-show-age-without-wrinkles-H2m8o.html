<p>Drawing an aged face requires more than just adding wrinkles. It's about understanding the underlying structure and changes that occur with age. This guide will help you create more realistic and compelling aged faces in your artwork.</p>

<h2>Basic Approach to Drawing an Aged Face</h2>

<p>When drawing an aged face, start by <strong>laying in simple representations of larger planes in the skull</strong>. This approach helps you focus on the overall structure rather than getting lost in details. It's crucial to <strong>avoid overreliance on wrinkles</strong>, which can become noisy and hurt the illusion of form. Instead, concentrate on the underlying changes that occur with age.</p>

<h2>Key Areas to Focus On</h2>

<p>When drawing an aged face, pay special attention to these areas:</p>

<ul>

<li>Eye sockets</li>

<li>Nose shape</li>

<li>Mouth</li>

<li>Cheekbones</li>

<li>Jaw</li>

<li>Temple</li>

</ul>

<p>Understanding how these areas change with age will help you create more realistic aged faces.</p>

<h2>Age-Related Changes in Facial Structure</h2>

<h3>Cheek Area</h3>

<p>The cheek area undergoes significant changes with age. In younger faces, this area is smoothed out due to fat coverage. As we age:</p>

<ul>

<li>The cheekbone becomes more prominent as fat shifts</li>

<li>The malar fat (cheek fat) slides down and settles near the nose</li>

<li>The transition from side to front of the cheek becomes more pronounced</li>

</ul>

<h3>Eye Area</h3>

<p>The area around the eyes is particularly affected by aging:</p>

<ul>

<li>Fat around the eye is affected by gravity</li>

<li>This creates pinches and wrinkles</li>

</ul>

<h3>Forehead</h3>

<p>With age, the forehead undergoes changes:</p>

<ul>

<li>It becomes more prominent</li>

<li>Fat underneath pulls tighter against the skull</li>

</ul>

<h3>Mouth and Jaw</h3>

<p>The lower part of the face also shows signs of aging:</p>

<ul>

<li>The buccal fat (near the mouth) and jowl fat are affected by gravity</li>

<li>Breaking up the straight line of the jaw suggests a later stage of life</li>

</ul>

<h3>Ears</h3>

<p>Interestingly, ears tend to get larger with age. Keep this in mind when drawing older characters.</p>

<h2>Importance of Head Construction</h2>

<p>Remember that head construction is a means to an end, not the final result. Consider how much detail is needed to move to the next step, whether that's rendering or painting. The contour of the face is a result of internal forms, not a thing in itself.</p>

<h2>Lighting and Shading Techniques</h2>

<h3>Dramatic Lighting</h3>

<p>Lighting can be used to tell a story, not just render form. The video uses an example from "The Godfather" to illustrate dramatic lighting.</p>

<h3>Basic Shapes in Head Construction</h3>

<p>Use basic shapes like spheres, cylinders, and boxes to construct the head. This simplification helps in understanding the overall structure.</p>

<h3>Edge Treatment</h3>

<p>Pay attention to edge treatment, as it's important in conveying the turn of surfaces.</p>

<h3>Value Distribution</h3>

<p>When shading, consider how light dissipates as it moves away from the source. Use three main values: light, shadow, and an average value. For focal points, develop either half-tones in light or darker half-tones in shadow.</p>

<h2>Practical Application</h2>

<p>When applying these principles:</p>

<ul>

<li>Use your understanding of form to guide your shading</li>

<li>Focus on the contrast between bone and muscle/fat, which becomes more apparent in older faces</li>

<li>Remember that the basic shapes and construction are tools to help you understand the form, not the end goal</li>

</ul>

<p>By focusing on these aspects, you'll be able to create more realistic and compelling aged faces in your artwork.</p>
