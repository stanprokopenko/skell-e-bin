<p>This course includes <strong>PDFs designed to enhance your skills</strong> in measuring and achieving accuracy in what you see. The focus is on drawing symmetrical objects, which helps you develop a keen eye for detail and precision.</p>

<h2>Exercise 1: Drawing the Other Half of a Base</h2>

<p>The initial exercise involves drawing the other half of a base. Your task is to <strong>mimic one side to create a symmetrical profile</strong>, treating it as a puzzle. It's important to avoid cheating methods like folding or tracing. Instead, approach the exercise as a mathematical puzzle. This challenge encourages you to freehand draw, using tools if necessary, but the ultimate goal is to achieve accuracy through measurement.</p>

<h2>Exercise 2: Mirroring a Mannequin Head</h2>

<p>Another PDF exercise involves <strong>mirroring the other side of a perfectly symmetrical mannequin head</strong>. Here, you are tasked with drawing the other side using any means except tracing or folding. This exercise proves that measuring and seeing solutions are key to drawing accurately. It requires you to ignore the identity of objects and focus on shapes and patterns.</p>

<h2>Importance of Shapes and Patterns</h2>

<p>In these exercises, it's crucial to <strong>ignore the identity of objects</strong> and instead focus on shapes and patterns for accuracy. This approach is similar to drawing the other half of a butterfly with patterns. The goal is to accurately transfer shapes to the other side of the paper.</p>

<h2>Tools and Techniques</h2>

<p>Initially, you may use tools to help with accuracy. However, the aim is to eventually <strong>rely on your eye</strong> for precision. These exercises are designed to awaken your brain and improve your ability to see and draw accurately.</p>

<h2>Goals and Feedback</h2>

<p>The ultimate goal of these exercises is to <strong>improve your ability to see and draw accurately</strong>. Feedback is encouraged to understand the impact of these exercises on your skills. By engaging with these tasks, you can assess your progress and refine your techniques.</p>
