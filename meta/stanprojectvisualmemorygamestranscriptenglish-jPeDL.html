<h2>Why Visual Memory Is Important</h2>

<p>Visual memory is crucial for artists. It helps you <strong>draw from imagination</strong>, <strong>draw faster</strong>, be more creative, and even improves your ability to <strong>draw from observation</strong>. Having a large library of images in your head while you're looking at reference helps you identify the <strong>important information</strong>. You'll be better at <strong>recognizing patterns</strong> that you've seen before and comparing those with what you're seeing now.</p>

<p>By having a highly trained visual memory, you'll be better able to process and store the complex information from your reference while you're drawing it.</p>

<h2>Visual Memory Games</h2>

<p>I'm gonna show you several exercises, challenges, and games that you can play to help improve your visual memory. Artists like Karl Kopinski, Kim Jung Gi, Peter Han, and Eliza Ivanova are able to do what they do because of their <strong>extraordinary visual memory</strong>. No matter what, it's gonna take a lot of practice to get there. But these visual memory games can help you get there faster.</p>

<h3>Game 1: Draw from Memory</h3>

<p>Start by looking at a reference for a minute or two. Study it and try to remember as much as you can about it. Then hide your reference and draw as much as you can from memory. If you want, you can gradually <strong>decrease the time</strong> you spend looking as you get better at this.</p>

<p>After you're done, bring back your reference and <strong>check your accuracy</strong>. For <strong>extra credit</strong>, you can try it again to see if you can do it better the second time.</p>

<h3>Game 2: Draw from a Different Angle</h3>

<p>Look at something and draw it from a <strong>different angle</strong>. You don't have to hide the reference for this one. Just trying to <strong>imagine it from a different angle</strong> is enough to improve your ability to visualize.</p>

<h3>Game 3: Combine Them</h3>

<p>Combine the first two games. Start by looking at your reference for a few minutes, and then draw it <strong>from memory</strong> and <strong>from a different angle</strong>. Or you can make it a little easier by starting with a <strong>study drawing</strong>. Draw it as you see it, then put all that away and draw it from memory and from a different angle. That initial drawing helps you learn the <strong>construction of the forms</strong> and remember a little bit better than just by looking at it.</p>

<h3>Game 4: Advanced Challenge (Level Two)</h3>

<p>This one is only for Level Two. If you're drawing from figure reference, draw it <strong>from a different angle</strong>, <strong>from memory</strong>, and <strong>change the proportions</strong>. You're using the reference as inspiration to <strong>redesign and create your own thing</strong>.</p>

<h3>Bonus Game: Drawing from a Moving Subject</h3>

<p>This next one's not part of this assignment, but you should try it at some point on your own. Draw from a <strong>moving subject</strong>. For example, if you go to the zoo, some animals are just sitting around or sleeping, but others are constantly moving.</p>

<p>Start by watching it for a few minutes, figure out the basic forms, and then take a <strong>snapshot in your mind</strong> of a pose you see as it's moving. Then you draw it. As you're drawing, the animal is still there to help you with the proportions and remind you of the basic forms, but the <strong>pose will have to be from memory</strong>. Occasionally, if you get lucky, you'll see that pose again.</p>

<p>It's very challenging, but it's a fun exercise that forces you to work with what you've got.</p>

<h2>Level One: Drawing from 3D Models</h2>

<p>For Level One, you're going to be drawing from <strong>3D models</strong> that are provided as the next eight lessons in the playlist. They're all interactive right in your browser. For each 3D model, you can pick the game that you want to try from the first three:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Draw from memory</strong></li>

<li><strong>Draw from a different angle</strong></li>

<li><strong>Combine them</strong></li>

</ul>

<p>For this project, make sure you're focused on practicing <strong>perspective</strong>. Construct these things out of <strong>simple primitives</strong>. In the next demos, I'll show you a few more perspective tricks like subtracting one form from another and how to draw the same curve in a different spot.</p>

<p>If you're not sure how to <strong>rotate</strong>, <strong>zoom</strong>, and <strong>pan</strong> the 3D model, just click the little help icon down here and you'll see the instructions. Also, if you hold <strong>Alt</strong> while dragging with the left mouse button, you can <strong>rotate just the light</strong>. That could be pretty useful.</p>

<p>The benefit of doing these from a 3D model is that if you're drawing it from a different angle, you can then change the angle of the 3D model to the one you drew to actually get <strong>instant feedback</strong> on how you did. But keep in mind, this isn't meant to be done perfectly. It's meant to challenge you and help you get better at <strong>visualizing 3D forms</strong> in your head.</p>

<p>If you rotate the model to check yourself and it's not exactly right, it's fine. Just take the feedback and do another one.</p>

<h2>Level Two: Drawing from Figure Poses</h2>

<p>For Level Two, you won't be able to check yourself because you'll be working from <strong>photos of figure poses</strong>. For each one, you can choose one of the four games. And don't forget that <strong>changing proportions</strong> is another option.</p>

<p>Simplify those poses to a <strong>mannequin</strong>. You can use the <strong>gestural torso boxes</strong> from the previous project, then attach cylinders for the limbs and the neck. The head can be a <strong>Loomis head</strong>. If you're not sure what that is, you can watch my free videos from a while back. Or you can just use a simple sphere or a box like we did before.</p>

<p>You can choose how simple you make the hands and feet.</p>

<h2>Keep Playing and Improving</h2>

<p>I'm giving you this reference for this specific project, but you can keep playing memory games like this after the course is done anytime you want to improve your visual memory. And you can do this with any focus. It doesn't have to be about perspective. You could try to remember the <strong>gesture</strong>, <strong>shapes</strong>, <strong>colors</strong>, <strong>shadows</strong>, whatever.</p>

<p>Alright, that's it. If you don't remember anything I said, you're off to a great start.</p>

<p><strong>Have fun!</strong></p>
