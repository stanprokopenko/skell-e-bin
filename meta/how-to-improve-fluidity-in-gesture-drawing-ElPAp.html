<p>Welcome to the final critique for gesture. This critique focuses on the <strong>shape method</strong> that we've been working on recently. I hope this approach offers a nice alternative to the initial, more rhythm and line-based method we explored earlier. My intention is to open you up to appreciating any number of styles that exist as a gradation between the two.</p>

<p>While our first approach leaves you with steps to develop if you want to complete something more fully rendered, it's also an entry into <strong>anatomy</strong>. This shape method, on the other hand, leads you more directly into <strong>shape design</strong> and <strong>light and shadow</strong>.</p>

<p>In this critique, I'll address big themes I noticed as I surveyed everyone's work. Even if your work isn't literally drawn over here, I hope you'll find these points beneficial.</p>

<h2>Challenges of the Shape Method</h2>

<p>One consistent challenge I see with this approach is that sometimes we get <strong>too stuck on the shape</strong>. In the part-to-part or shape-based method, we might focus so much on individual shapes that we lose the overall flow.</p>

<p>In contrast, the initial method of lines and relating everything doesn't give you this immediate benefit of shape or weight, but it guarantees that everything is <strong>tied together</strong>. There's a unifying aspect, a flow to all the different parts, even if those parts aren't defined.</p>

<p>This shape method gives you those parts right out of the gate, but it's hard to make them feel <strong>fluid</strong>. What one method is beneficial for, the other lacks. By understanding both approaches, you can start to <strong>tailor and customize a quality of gesture that's just yours</strong>.</p>

<h2>Carrying Through the Center Line</h2>

<p>To address the lack of fluidity, I recommend <strong>carrying through your center line</strong>. For example, start with the center line of the face and continue it into the center line of the throat and down through the body. This helps create a flow or some kind of rhythm, tying the parts together.</p>

<p>You can also look for long winding <strong>S-curves</strong> that give one long gestural statement to hang the rest of the information on. This establishes a unifying or <strong>establishing rhythm</strong>.</p>

<h2>Finding Tilts and Exaggerating Them</h2>

<p>Make sure to find the <strong>tilts</strong> in the torso and pelvis. Even if the tilts are subtle, you can <strong>push the exaggeration</strong> to enhance the gesture. This adds more weight and movement to your drawings.</p>

<h2>Ensuring Perspective Connections</h2>

<p>It's important to ensure that your <strong>perspective connections</strong> are there. Avoid flat lines that create visual stops. Instead, use wrapping lines and perspective rhythms to <strong>bridge or create carry-through</strong> between parts.</p>

<h2>Using Asymmetry to Break Symmetry</h2>

<p>Sometimes, starting with an <strong>asymmetrical placement</strong> helps with the carry-over or transition from one part to the next. For example, you might start the leg from a different point than expected, which can create a more dynamic and fluid gesture.</p>

<h2>Relating Arms and Legs Across the Body</h2>

<p>Consider relating the arms and legs across the body using <strong>relational rhythms</strong>. This might involve drawing curves that flow from one side of the body to the other, helping to <strong>tie your eye across</strong> the figure.</p>

<h2>Incorporating Anatomy and Form</h2>

<p>Understanding and incorporating <strong>anatomy</strong> helps in better understanding of connections and transitions. For example, you can think of the <strong>shoulders as a box</strong> that lives over the rib cage. This helps to avoid stiff transitions from the arm and rib cage.</p>

<p>By adding anatomical landmarks like the <strong>scapula</strong>, you can create overlaps and wraps with every line. This not only helps with transitions but also gives you more <strong>perspective</strong>.</p>

<h2>Avoiding Over-Reliance on Contours</h2>

<p>Be cautious not to get <strong>too stuck on the outside lines or contours</strong>. Focus on the internal parts and connections. Overly heavy contours can take us outside of the parts instead of appreciating the relational quality between them.</p>

<h2>Using Negative Space to Check Proportions</h2>

<p>Use <strong>negative space</strong> to check proportions. Looking at the negative shapes around your figure can help you spot any proportional inaccuracies. This can be especially helpful in catching issues like limbs that are too long or too short.</p>

<h2>Stylizing and Character Design</h2>

<p>Many of you played around with <strong>stylizing</strong> and character design. The shape method lends itself well to this. However, be mindful of <strong>perspective</strong> when stylizing. Ensure that you don't unintentionally change the camera angle or create unwanted foreshortening.</p>

<p>For example, when altering body proportions for a character, make sure all parts exist in the same <strong>perspective plane</strong>. This helps maintain the overall coherence of the figure.</p>

<h2>Moving Forward: From Shape Method to Light and Shadow</h2>

<p>This approach provides a better path into the development of <strong>light and shadow</strong>. Once you have your simple mannequin, you can start to map out the light and shadow on top.</p>

<h3>Understanding Anatomy as Forms</h3>

<p>Think of the muscles and body parts as <strong>basic forms</strong> like cylinders, eggs, and boxes. This helps in understanding how to render them with light and shadow.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Trapezius</strong>: Think of it as a compressed cylinder. Light it as you would a cylinder hit from three-quarters.</li>

<li><strong>Deltoid</strong>: Consider it a sphere. Light it accordingly.</li>

<li><strong>Tricep</strong>: Visualize it as a ball on the back of the cylinder of the arm.</li>

</ul>

<p>By understanding anatomy as forms, you can bring a sense of <strong>naturalism</strong> through the lighting.</p>

<h3>Mapping Light and Shadow</h3>

<p>Begin by mapping out the <strong>light and shadow</strong> areas on your figure. Focus on <strong>form shadows</strong> (the form itself being hit by light) and <strong>cast shadows</strong> (where one form blocks light from another).</p>

<p>Use differences in <strong>edge quality</strong> to indicate how the form transitions:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Soft edges</strong> for slow transitions.</li>

<li><strong>Firm edges</strong> for more defined areas.</li>

<li><strong>Hard edges</strong> for sharp transitions or cast shadows.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Adding Details with Anatomy</h3>

<p>An understanding of anatomy allows you to think about the muscles individually as their own <strong>perspective contributions</strong> to a part. This means you can bring in <strong>surface effects</strong> and <strong>micro transitions</strong>, enhancing the realism and naturalism in your drawings.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p>I hope this critique gives you ideas not just about consistent problems throughout the assignment but also about where this approach can go. By integrating the shape method with considerations of anatomy, light, and shadow, you can develop more finished and expressive drawings.</p>

<p>Remember, each approach has its strengths and weaknesses. By understanding both, you can create a gesture drawing style that's uniquely yours. Keep experimenting, keep pushing, and continue to develop your eye for gesture, shape, and form.</p>
