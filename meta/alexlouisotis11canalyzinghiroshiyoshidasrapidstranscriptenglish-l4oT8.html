<h2>Observing Water Shapes and Perspective</h2>

<p>When you look at Hiroshi Yoshida's <strong>"Rapids,"</strong> notice how <strong>water arranges itself into roundish shapes</strong> when viewed from above. However, when you look along them, as in this piece, they <strong>compress into ellipses</strong>. Understanding <strong>ellipses</strong> is crucial here.</p>

<p>Observe how Yoshida treats the <strong>top plane of the waterfall</strong>. He depicts it as a plane with varying heights, breaking into a <strong>sloping front plane</strong> with a slight curve. This demonstrates his awareness of <strong>planes in perspective</strong>.</p>

<h2>Composition and Cross Contours</h2>

<p>Yoshida creates a <strong>rhythm of light areas with dark patches</strong> and <strong>dark areas with light patches</strong>. While this is a compositional choice, he doesn't sacrifice <strong>perspective</strong> to achieve this rhythm. Instead, he uses <strong>cross contour lines</strong> to enhance both composition and perspective.</p>

<p>Even in portions of the waterfall, he treats them as <strong>segments of an interior cylinder</strong>. The lines <strong>crowd together at the edges</strong>, as they would on the inside of a cylinder, and <strong>spread out as they face toward you</strong>.</p>

<h2>Scale and Depth</h2>

<p>Notice how the <strong>froth and wavelets decrease in size</strong> as they recede into the distance. The larger shapes in the foreground contrast with the <strong>smaller, intricate patterns</strong> in the background, enhancing the sense of <strong>depth</strong>.</p>

<h2>Perspective Mastery</h2>

<p>Yoshida's ability to control the convincingness of water through <strong>perspective</strong> is remarkable. His work is both stylized and realistic, showcasing his <strong>mastery of perspective</strong>. As you study perspective, find images like this that demonstrate skills you wish to develop. <strong>Analyze them</strong> to deepen your understanding and apply these principles to your own work.</p>
