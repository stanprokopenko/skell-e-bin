<h2>What's in Premium?</h2>

<p>In the premium lesson, you'll learn how embracing "clangers"—experimental marks and spontaneous sketches made without concern for perfection—can enhance your drawing skills. The lesson covers techniques for drawing clangers, such as using different hand positions for varied lines and strokes, and leveraging shapes and rhythms to connect parts of your drawings. You'll discover how to overcome the fear of the blank page by filling it with clangers, understand the importance of using the gestural hand for fluid and dynamic lines, and see how observing everyday people can inspire diverse and compelling characters. The lesson emphasizes the value of practice and experimentation in improving your art.</p>
