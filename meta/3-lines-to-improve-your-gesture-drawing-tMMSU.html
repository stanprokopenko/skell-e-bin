<p>In this lesson, we'll cover <strong>line weight</strong> and <strong>line quality</strong>, which are the first building blocks of learning how to draw anything. This is especially important for <strong>gesture drawing</strong>. You might not think about learning how to draw good lines when aiming for a cool, academic drawing that impresses others. But honestly, it's the thing that can often improve your drawings the most, and it is something you can practice easily. It's a lifelong skill, and you'll get better at it over time.</p>

<h2>The Importance of Good Lines in Drawing</h2>

<p>Everything we'll discuss in this lesson are things you can continually work on and practice. We'll cover:</p>

<ul>

<li>The different types of lines and how they can be used in different circumstances to communicate different things.</li>

<li>How to make lines feel like they overlap.</li>

<li>The beginnings of using <strong>line weight</strong> to push and pull form and create depth.</li>

<li>How different artists use line weight differently to invoke different moods and tell different stories.</li>

</ul>

<h2>C, S, and I Lines</h2>

<h3>What Are C, S, and I Lines?</h3>

<p>If you've taken any figure drawing class or watched tutorials online, you've probably heard of <strong>C, S, and I lines</strong>. As the name suggests, they are:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>C Lines</strong>: Simple curved lines.</li>

<li><strong>S Lines</strong>: More complex curves resembling the letter S.</li>

<li><strong>I Lines</strong>: Straight lines.</li>

</ul>

<p>These lines are the foundation of gesture drawing. You can break down any part of the body using these three lines.</p>

<h3>Using C, S, and I Lines in Drawing</h3>

<p>Each of these lines communicates different ideas within the body:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>C Curves</strong>: Use them to create rounded forms like muscles or soft tissues. For example, drawing a deltoid muscle.</li>

<li><strong>S Curves</strong>: Use them to indicate flow and gesture, showing how a pose is twisting or moving.</li>

<li><strong>I Lines</strong>: Use them to emphasize straight edges or bony parts like elbows or knees.</li>

</ul>

<p>You're going to use these lines for about <strong>90â€“95%</strong> of the drawing. The contour details happen later, in the rendering stage, where you're creating more definitive forms.</p>

<h2>Gesture vs. Contour</h2>

<h3>Understanding Contour</h3>

<p>A <strong>contour</strong> is the outline of a shape, the exact edges of an object. For example, when drawing an arm, the contour outlines what you think is happening in the arm.</p>

<h3>Understanding Gesture</h3>

<p><strong>Gesture</strong> is about what the object is <strong>doing</strong>, not what it <strong>is</strong>. It's the action, motion, or flow. You add the contour details later, once you have an idea of what's happening on a larger scale within the drawing.</p>

<p>For this lesson, we'll focus on the <strong>2D abstract lines</strong> of just C, S, and I lines.</p>

<h2>Simplifying Complex Forms</h2>

<p>Drawing well, especially gesture drawing, is about <strong>abstraction</strong>, and simplifying complex ideas into simple versions. You're taking something as complex as an arm, with its tendons, bones, muscles, veins, and context, and turning it into a simple shape or curve.</p>

<p>The more you're able to contain more information within a simplified shape, the better you'll be at depicting the gesture. Gesture is all about what the thing is <strong>doing</strong>, it is not about the detailed anatomy. The way you use these lines will help your style emerge.</p>

<h2>Styles and Applications</h2>

<p>The subjective nature of gesture drawing means that different artists will use these lines differently, which affects their style:</p>

<ul>

<li>A cartoonist might focus more on the flowy nature and omit a lot of anatomy, emphasizing motion and expression.</li>

<li>A fine artist might emphasize all the anatomy, focusing on form and technical accuracy.</li>

</ul>

<p>Throughout this course, we'll explore how artists like John Singer Sargent use these lines to communicate complex forms and tell a story. We'll see how animators use these tools to communicate motion sequentially throughout a scene.</p>

<h2>The Role of Intuition in Gesture Drawing</h2>

<p>One important aspect of gesture drawing is <strong>intuition</strong>. When drawing gesture, you're not just thinking about what a pose is doing exactly, you're letting your hand <strong>feel through</strong> the drawing.</p>

<h3>Building Intuition Through Practice</h3>

<p>Drawing good lines comes from practice and building muscle memory. An exercise to illustrate this:</p>

<ul>

<li>Take your <strong>dominant hand</strong> and draw a circle. You'll likely feel confident in your ability to draw circles, straight lines, C curves, and S curves.</li>

<li>Now, try drawing a circle with your <strong>non-dominant hand</strong>. You'll notice that the confidence and ability to execute the same flow disappears.</li>

</ul>

<p>The only reason you're able to draw well with your dominant hand is that you've done it a lot and built up that intuition.</p>

<p>If you're a beginner or haven't built up that level of confidence yet, <strong>be patient</strong>. Drawing well takes time. It's about integrating knowledge into your art practice and letting it digest over time until it becomes intuitive.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p>The act of drawing well, and gesture drawing specifically, is about letting your hand flow and creating lines that eventually represent something. These lines help you tell a story.</p>

<p>Remember, the more you practice drawing <strong>C, S, and I lines</strong>, the faster and more efficient you'll become at using them to depict form. Be patient with yourself, and trust the process. Over time, these skills will become second nature, and your ability to capture gesture and motion will greatly improve.</p>
