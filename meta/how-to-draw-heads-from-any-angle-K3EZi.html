<p>Welcome to the critique session. Many great submissions were received. Reviewed all submissions to identify common struggles and questions. Example provided uses an egg shape for the cranial mass instead of a ball. Questions about head width and temple placement were common. Proportions given move with the face regardless of position.</p>

<h2>Common Questions and Struggles</h2>

<p>Questions about <strong>head width and temple placement</strong> were common. The <strong>proportions</strong> given move with the face regardless of position. A common method used is the <strong>five eyes across</strong> technique, possibly from Andrew Loomis. This method works well in front view but not in turned views. </p>

<p>Temple placement is <strong>flexible and mobile</strong>, not fixed. A practical approach favors what works for drawing over exact measurements. Temple positioning helps show side versus front view. The position of the drawing is more important than exact temple placement. Temple placement changes with head rotation. </p>

<p>Finding the temple involves sighting and using clues like the brow end and shadow. Drawing is seen as a malleable, sculptural process. Features are about form intersections, not just drawing skulls and noses. Value gradation indicates surface turn. Drawing involves building up and modifying forms.</p>

<h2>Proportions and Temple Placement</h2>

<p>Temple placement is <strong>flexible and mobile</strong>, not fixed. A practical approach favors what works for drawing over exact measurements. Temple positioning helps show side versus front view. The position of the drawing is more important than exact temple placement. Temple placement changes with head rotation.</p>

<h2>Practical Drawing Approaches</h2>

<p>Finding the temple involves <strong>sighting and using clues</strong> like the brow end and shadow. Drawing is seen as a <strong>malleable, sculptural process</strong>. Features are about <strong>form intersections</strong>, not just drawing skulls and noses. Value gradation indicates surface turn. Drawing involves <strong>building up and modifying forms</strong>.</p>

<p>Emphasis is placed on <strong>form intersections and surface quality</strong>. For example, cutting back the cranial mass reveals sockets. It's important to maintain perspective and form continuity. Each form must wrap and connect to the dominant surface, like the head or skull.</p>

<h2>Importance of Perspective and Form Continuity</h2>

<p><strong>Managing shapes in perspective</strong> is crucial. Each form must <strong>wrap and connect to the dominant surface</strong> (head/skull). For example, when drawing the back of the head, align the proportions correctly. The placement of the occipital bone and its relationship to other features is important.</p>

<p>Maintaining perspective and form continuity is essential. When building forms and features in profile view, focus on spatial relationships and form intersections. Adjust proportions and perspective as needed. Dealing with extreme views requires maintaining form and sighting features based on perspective.</p>

<p>Adjust the tilt and perspective in your head drawing. Manage the tilts throughout your drawing to maintain consistency. Keep the initial direction of your face drop consistent to avoid warping. Double-check the nose and watch the tilts for overall presentation. Use curves instead of straight lines for profiles to enhance perspective.</p>

<p>Check proportions using halves and thirds. Practice building past the plane of the face for profiles. Ensure the skull ends at the base of the nose. Create the occipital shelf and forward to the ear. Draw through the jaw, slightly underneath the eye and chin. Push overlaps in the cheek area for better form. Ensure the face in profile view is asymmetrical.</p>

<p>Double-check proportions when looking up and down. Match features to the angle of the face underneath. Push the neck more in line with the spine for naturalism. Ensure features attach to the front plane of the face. Use wrapping lines to maintain form intersection. Adjust the height of the ear and other features as needed.</p>

<p>Use form intersections to relate big decisions and soften them later. Modify head construction to emulate qualities of the subject. Thin the chin or move the corner in for a more feminine look. Adjust the height of the cheekbone and the trajectory of the temple. Round off corners for a softer face feeling. Define the planes of the nose early for easier development.</p>

<p>Check the width across the front and adjust the temple placement. Use perspective rings to ensure consistent under planes. Ensure asymmetrical C versus S curves for better form. There's a slight difference in height, making the neck feel static. The thyroid cartilage and windpipe structure the neck. The pit of the neck and clavicle fill in some masses. Traps and temple are indicated.</p>

<h2>Examples and Techniques for Head Drawing</h2>

<p><strong>Finding the Temple and Other Features</strong></p>

<p>Finding the temple involves sighting and using clues like the brow end and shadow. Drawing is seen as a malleable, sculptural process. Features are about form intersections, not just drawing skulls and noses. Value gradation indicates surface turn. Drawing involves building up and modifying forms.</p>

<p><strong>Building Forms and Features in Profile View</strong></p>

<p>When building forms and features in profile view, focus on spatial relationships and form intersections. Ensure each form wraps and connects to the dominant surface, like the head or skull. For example, align the proportions correctly when drawing the back of the head. The placement of the occipital bone and its relationship to other features is important.</p>

<p><strong>Modifying Head Construction for Subject Qualities</strong></p>

<p>Modify head construction to emulate qualities of the subject. Thin the chin or move the corner in for a more feminine look. Adjust the height of the cheekbone and the trajectory of the temple. Round off corners for a softer face feeling. Define the planes of the nose early for easier development.</p>

<p><strong>Using Wrapping Lines for Form Intersection</strong></p>

<p>Use wrapping lines to maintain form intersection. Adjust the height of the ear and other features as needed. Use form intersections to relate big decisions and soften them later. Check the width across the front and adjust the temple placement. Use perspective rings to ensure consistent under planes.</p>

<p><strong>Fine-Tuning Features and Proportions</strong></p>

<p>Ensure asymmetrical C versus S curves for better form. There's a slight difference in height, making the neck feel static. The thyroid cartilage and windpipe structure the neck. The pit of the neck and clavicle fill in some masses. Traps and temple are indicated. The jaw starts at a specific point and moves down to an initial cutback. The ear placement is a helpful measurement. Features placement involves keystone and profile. Triangular planes are used for eye sockets and other features. Overlapping forms can enhance the drawing. The center of the eye aligns with the corner of the mouth.</p>

<p><strong>Flexibility in Steps for Adjustments and Changes</strong></p>

<p>Flexibility in steps allows for adjustments and changes. The keystone might be too wide, affecting the brow area. Form intersections and overlaps are crucial for maintaining perspective. Consistent stacking of perspectives is necessary. Drawing involves creating a 3D grid or mesh. Each form should stand on one of the axes. The language of drawing involves understanding and comfort. The denture sphere should integrate with the head's rhythm. Muscles are form intersections that add to the dominant form. Drawing is sculptural, requiring an understanding of form. Proportions should be checked at each stage. The base of the nose might be placed too low. The steps are understood, but fine-tuning is needed. The wrapping lines should connect and integrate with the form. The jaw shape should reflect the model's form. Overlapping the chin behind the nose builds depth. The nose might be too long; double-check proportions. The process is understood, but tweaking and molding are necessary. Success with the process allows for tweaking lines and molding head construction. This approach helps in dealing with likeness.</p>
