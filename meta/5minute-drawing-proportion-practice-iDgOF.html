<h2>Homework Assignment Overview</h2>

<p>Your homework for this lesson is to start including proportions on top of your drawings. This practice is crucial for improving your understanding of facial structure and ensuring your drawings are accurate.</p>

<h2>Adding Proportions to Existing Drawings</h2>

<p>To begin, work from the <strong>brow to the chin</strong>. Focus on developing the <strong>halves and thirds</strong> of the face. Here's how you can do it:</p>

<ul>

<li>Take your previous drawings where you have the first four steps completed.</li>

<li>On top of these drawings, assign the halves and thirds.</li>

<li>This will help you see how the proportions fit into your existing work.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Practicing the Entire Process</h2>

<p>Next, you need to practice the entire process on new drawings. Follow these steps:</p>

<ul>

<li>Spend <strong>five minutes per drawing</strong>.</li>

<li>Aim to complete <strong>20 drawings in total</strong>.</li>

<li>Work through <strong>steps one through five</strong> for each drawing.</li>

</ul>

<p>The five-minute marker is a bit arbitrary. It's mainly to keep you focused and prevent you from falling into bad habits. If you need to extend the time a little, that's okay. The goal is to have a time limit to ensure you don't overdo or underdo it.</p>

<h2>Importance of the Time Limit</h2>

<p>The <strong>five-minute marker</strong> serves several purposes:</p>

<ul>

<li>It keeps you focused.</li>

<li>It helps you avoid falling into bad habits.</li>

<li>It ensures you don't spend too much or too little time on each drawing.</li>

</ul>

<p>Remember, the time limit is flexible. If you need a bit more time, that's fine. The key is to have a guideline to help you manage your practice effectively.</p>
