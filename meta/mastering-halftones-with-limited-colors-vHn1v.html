<p>I took some time to explain terms related to mixing and halftone, aiming to clarify these concepts. Let's dive into the process of mixing colors, particularly halftones, and the practical aspects of managing and using these mixtures in painting.</p>

<p><strong>Mixing Halftones</strong></p>

<p>I began mixing halftones using mustard and ketchup colors. This time, I decided not to add white to the mixture. Once mixed, I store the colors in jars to prevent them from drying out, allowing me to take breaks without any issues.</p>

<p><strong>Adjusting Chroma with Black</strong></p>

<p>I added a bit of black to the mixture to adjust the chroma. I was amazed at how ketchup and mustard can replicate browns. I used to avoid black, fearing it was a "dead" color, but now I appreciate its utility in creating realistic grays and browns.</p>

<p><strong>Limited Palette Benefits</strong></p>

<p>My palette usually includes raw umber, transparent oxide brown, and red, but I can approximate these with limited colors. Using a limited palette can enhance color harmony, though I sometimes rely on pre-mixed colors for convenience under deadlines.</p>

<p><strong>Understanding Halftones and Values</strong></p>

<p>The halftone mixture is slightly darker and warmer than the light, and it reflects the local color as light diminishes. Highlights show the true color of the light source, while halftones reveal more of the object's local color. Matching values is challenging and requires practice, squinting can help determine if values match.</p>

<p><strong>Techniques for Smooth Transitions</strong></p>

<p>For smooth transitions, I might mix shadow and halftone together, but blending is a separate topic.</p>

<p><strong>Preparation and Preservation</strong></p>

<p>I have my average light, halftone, and shadow colors ready, simplifying the painting process. I plan to preserve the paint in jars to extend its usability, leaving some on the palette for immediate use. The shadow color dries fastest, so I prioritize preserving it. Preparation is part of the painting process.</p>

<p><strong>Painting Process</strong></p>

<p>I clean my palette and prepare to start painting, emphasizing that preparation is part of the painting process. I have already mixed the necessary colors, so I won't repeat the mixing process on camera.</p>
