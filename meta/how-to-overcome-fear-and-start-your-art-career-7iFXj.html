<h2>Moving Beyond the Student Mentality</h2>

<p>I've seen many artists who <strong>overdo the student mentality</strong>. They perpetually take classes and <strong>never stop putting themselves under some other artist</strong>. While learning is crucial, there comes a time when you need to <strong>move on</strong> and <strong>express what you've learned in your own way</strong>.</p>

<p>I believe that sometimes <strong>school can be too safe</strong>. It's comfortable to stay in a place where you're always learning, but <strong>you need to get out there</strong>. Facing challenges and even <strong>falling on your face</strong> is part of the journey to becoming a professional.</p>

<h2>My Transition from Student to Professional</h2>

<p>When I was 19, I asked my teacher, "When will I know when it's time for me to go out and actually make a living and become an illustrator?" He told me, <strong>"When you're consistent."</strong></p>

<p>After about three years in art school, my teacher said I was ready. I got a job working on movie posters. Suddenly, I had to make all this knowledge <strong>work right now</strong>. It was <strong>trial by fire</strong>.</p>

<p>I fell on my face a few times in the beginning, but I learned quickly. <strong>Getting out of the mindset of being a student into being a professional</strong> requires guts. It's about <strong>making something out of this knowledge</strong> and not just being in school forever.</p>

<h2>The Role of Passion in Art</h2>

<p>Why did I practice drawing as a young kid, for hours on end? Because I was <strong>drawing things I was interested in</strong>. I drew Batman, the Batmobile, superheroes, whatever captured my imagination.</p>

<p>Passion drives practice. When you're interested in something, you'll work harder at it and <strong>do a better job</strong>. I encouraged my daughters to draw things they loved. It wasn't about learning to draw the head, it was about drawing Harry Potter or characters from their favorite shows.</p>

<p>When you draw your passions, <strong>you get into it</strong>, and that's how you express yourself. <strong>Fan art</strong> comes from that place of passion, and it leads to improvement because you're invested in what you're creating.</p>

<h2>Balancing Passion and Making a Living</h2>

<p>I've been approached by art sellers who want me to paint subjects I'm not interested in. They say, <strong>"I know I could sell it."</strong> But I have <strong>no desire to paint contemporary scenes</strong> that don't inspire me.</p>

<p>I choose to paint what I love, the Western themes, the costumes, the time period. It's not about getting followers or collectors, it's about <strong>doing what I want to do</strong>.</p>

<p>Yes, you need to navigate the professional world, but <strong>staying true to your interests</strong> is essential. If you're passionate about what you're creating, <strong>you'll work harder at it</strong>, and it will show in your work.</p>

<h2>Dealing with Failure and Persistence</h2>

<p>Failure is inevitable. Whether you're just starting or you're a seasoned artist, there will be times when things don't go as planned. I've had paintings that didn't sell, even after six months or more of work. It can <strong>mess with your head</strong>, but you have to keep going.</p>

<p>When you're learning, you'll make mistakes. <strong>You're going to fail</strong>, and that's okay. It's about having a strong sense of self and not getting discouraged. You have to <strong>believe that you'll get there</strong> and keep working at it.</p>

<h2>Learning and Teaching Art</h2>

<p>One of the worst things that can happen is you take an art class and walk away <strong>more discouraged</strong> than when you started. I believe in <strong>breaking down information methodically</strong>. Don't throw six balls at a beginner and say, <strong>"Here, juggle them."</strong></p>

<p>In my teaching, I start with simple steps:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Mapping out</strong> the drawing.</li>

<li><strong>Separating lights from shadows</strong>.</li>

<li>Learning to mix an average light and shadow.</li>

</ul>

<p>We focus on one thing at a time. Once you're handling that well, we introduce the next element. It's about <strong>building confidence and skill gradually</strong>, so you don't feel overwhelmed.</p>

<h2>Applying Fundamentals Across Mediums</h2>

<p>The fundamental principles of art <strong>stay the same across different mediums</strong>. When I started digital painting, I applied the same principles I use in oil painting. I don't rely on digital tricks, I approach it as if I'm working traditionally.</p>

<p>Whether you're painting, drawing, or working digitally, skills like observing tone, edges, shapes, and measuring <strong>always apply</strong>. Practicing in different mediums validates that <strong>these fundamentals work</strong>.</p>

<h2>Understanding Time Frames in Art</h2>

<p>One misunderstanding I've noticed is <strong>how different time frames change your approach</strong> in art. Starting a 9-hour drawing the same way you start a 20-minute sketch is a recipe for disaster.</p>

<p>In short sketches, you might rely more on memory and knowledge to get it done quickly. But for long drawings, you need to spend more time on mapping, measuring, and observing. <strong>Understanding the timing</strong> helps you know <strong>when to use certain methods</strong>, like the Loomis or Riley techniques.</p>

<h2>Advice for Art Students</h2>

<p>Here are some things I've learned:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Practice consistently</strong>. Put in the hours, and apply the principles you're learning.</li>

<li><strong>Draw what you love</strong>. Your passion will drive you to improve.</li>

<li><strong>Don't be discouraged by failure</strong>. It's a natural part of the learning process.</li>

<li><strong>Transition from loving the subject to loving the process</strong>. As you grow, you might find joy in the act of creating itself.</li>

</ul>

<p>If you're thinking about making art your career, remember that it's not always easy. <strong>Consider having a backup job</strong> to take the pressure off. It's a tough industry, but if you're passionate and determined, <strong>you'll find your way</strong>.</p>

<h2>My Painting Course for Beginners</h2>

<p>I've put together a painting course designed especially for beginners. I wanted to <strong>give back</strong> to those just starting out. Instead of overwhelming you with advanced techniques, I <strong>break down the process into manageable steps</strong>.</p>

<p>We start with:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Drawing and mapping out</strong> the subject.</li>

<li><strong>Separating lights from shadows</strong>.</li>

<li><strong>Mixing simple colors</strong>.</li>

</ul>

<p>I use only <strong>four paints</strong>: white, black, alizarin crimson, and yellow ochre. You don't need expensive materials or extensive knowledge. This course is about <strong>holding your hand through each stage</strong>, just like my teacher did for me.</p>

<p>I believe that <strong>anyone can learn to paint</strong> if they have the right guidance. By simplifying the process, you can achieve results <strong>you won't believe</strong>. It's about building confidence and skill in a way that's <strong>accessible and affordable</strong>.</p>
