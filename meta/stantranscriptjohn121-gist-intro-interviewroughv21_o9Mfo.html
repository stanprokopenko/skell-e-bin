<p>Hi, I'm Eric Gist, though you might know me as <strong>EMGIST</strong>. I've worked on various projects in the comic book industry, primarily as a cover artist. Some of my favorite works include covers for <strong>Fantastic Four</strong>, <strong>Iron Fist</strong>, <strong>Wolverine</strong>, and <strong>Hulk</strong>. I've mostly done variant covers—the secondary covers for comic issues.</p>

<h2>My Favorite Covers</h2>

<p>Picking a favorite cover is tough because I like many of them for different reasons. It would probably be between my <strong>Fantastic Four</strong> cover and my <strong>Hulk</strong> cover.</p>

<p>The <strong>Hulk</strong> cover was exciting because it was an action scene—a classic fight between Wolverine and Hulk. Every comic artist wants to illustrate that battle at some point. Plus, it featured a zombie Wolverine, which was cool since I'm known for drawing zombies.</p>

<p>The <strong>Fantastic Four</strong> cover was fun because it involved more storytelling. With multiple characters, each with their own characteristics and the whole family dynamic, trying to capture all that in a single image was a great challenge that I enjoyed.</p>

<h2>My Journey into Comics</h2>

<p>I did my first comic cover around 2007, so I've been doing this for about 15 years. I started working for Marvel in 2016, with my first work being a series of covers for the <strong>Haunted Mansion</strong> series. My first cover featuring a major Marvel character was for the anniversary issue of <strong>Crazy</strong> in 2019. So, for Marvel-specific on-brand work, it's been about four or five years.</p>

<p>From a young age, I wanted to draw comic books. I was into comics since I was a kid—probably around eight years old when I considered myself a comic fan. Initially, I wanted to do interiors. During the '90s boom, when comics started becoming more mainstream, I worked on interiors. I wasn't very good, but I did submissions every month to all the companies and received tons of rejection letters—some of which I still have.</p>

<p>Then I started training with Jeff Watts and realized I had more of a knack for <strong>single image storytelling</strong>. I still loved the genre of comics but shifted my focus to painting and cover art. It took me about ten years to get good enough and another five to start catching on and doing covers professionally.</p>

<p>I got into the industry by taking my work to Comic-Con, showing interior samples at first, but then transitioning to cover art. I've only done covers in comics. I've been asked to do interiors a couple of times, but it never grabbed my interest. If I do interiors, it would have to be a project I'm really excited about. I've also done card illustrations, which is similar to covers but printed on cards instead.</p>

<h2>My Artistic Style</h2>

<p>Broadly speaking, my style is often dictated by how I feel about the characters I'm illustrating—not in terms of liking or disliking them, but capturing their essence and conveying that in the image.</p>

<p>I'm known for <strong>deep shadows, high contrast, and moodier pieces</strong>—a noir or horror feel. That's kind of my signature. But in the last year or two, I've been branching out into brighter-colored works, especially when illustrating brighter characters like the <strong>Fantastic Four</strong> or <strong>Iron Fist</strong>.</p>

<p>With the <strong>Fantastic Four</strong>, I went in a more <strong>Norman Rockwell</strong> direction—he's one of my favorite artists. For the <strong>Iron Fist</strong> cover, I used brighter colors to show the history of the character and the literal passing of the torch.</p>

<p>I strive to create images that stand out in people's minds—<strong>iconic images</strong> that are memorable and stand the test of time. I admire artists who balance an iconic image with a deeper story. Your initial read is something unforgettable, but once you look deeper, there's more to discover. That's the kind of painting I want to make—something that sticks with you day after day.</p>

<h2>Advice for Aspiring Artists</h2>

<h3>Specializing vs. Generalizing</h3>

<p>When starting out, it's important to <strong>specialize</strong>. Get really good at one thing before branching out. In comics, you might need to be well-rounded eventually, as the lines between pencilers, inkers, and colorists are blurring. But initially, focusing on mastering one area will serve you better than being mediocre at several.</p>

<p>However, it's good to know a little bit about everything. Be a <strong>jack of all trades, master of one</strong>. Understanding the roles of inkers, colorists, and even writers helps you communicate better with your team.</p>

<h3>Improving at Making Covers</h3>

<p>To get better at making covers, <strong>study the people who are good at it</strong>. Don't limit yourself to contemporary artists or just comic cover artists. Look at cover artists throughout the history of illustration and even narrative painters before print, like <strong>Bouguereau</strong>, <strong>Caravaggio</strong>, and <strong>Rembrandt</strong>. I often look at their work more than modern artists.</p>

<p>Work on your <strong>fundamentals</strong> and <strong>make covers</strong>. If you want to get better at golf, you play golf. If you want to get better at making covers, you make covers. Create a lot of them, even if they're bad at first. That's how you'll improve.</p>

<h3>Important Fundamentals</h3>

<p>The fundamentals include:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Figure Drawing</strong>: This includes basic drawing, fundamental forms, lighting, and anatomy. In comics, figures are paramount.</li>

<li><strong>Composition</strong>: Placing the figure in an interesting composition is crucial.</li>

<li><strong>Color Theory</strong></li>

<li><strong>Perspective</strong></li>

</ul>

<p>Focus on being really good at figures and composition. You can let some things slide in other areas, but you can't be bad at anything because it can be distracting.</p>

<h3>Avoiding Common Pitfalls</h3>

<p>Avoid forcing a style. Study your influences and <strong>let your style emerge naturally</strong>. Don't try too hard to be someone else, or you'll end up a second-rate version of another artist. <strong>Be yourself</strong>.</p>

<h3>Embracing Limitations</h3>

<p>Limitations can be beneficial. They make you be clever and think through problems, leading to more creative solutions. When you're restricted, you have to find a way around, which can result in originality. Limitations force you to dig deeper, and anything that does that is great for creativity.</p>

<h3>The Importance of Thumbnails</h3>

<p><strong>Thumbnails are a vital part of the process</strong>. A friend once told me that the first five thumbnails you do are always someone else's idea. It's important to push past those initial ideas to reach something unique to you. Don't settle for your first idea; explore multiple options.</p>

<h3>Looking Back: What I Wish I Knew</h3>

<p>I wish I knew <strong>how good you have to be</strong> to work at certain levels. Each level you reach, especially in comics, there's a tier system. Starting off, you might work for smaller companies with less exposure. As you climb, you're competing for attention among top artists.</p>

<p>When I was younger, I submitted work to Marvel, DC, and Image without realizing how unrealistic it was at my skill level then. Maybe that ignorance kept me motivated, but looking back, I realize how much I needed to improve. Even now, I sometimes wish my work was better when I see it next to giants like <strong>Alex Ross</strong> and <strong>Totino Tedesco</strong>.</p>

<p>Your job is to create good images, but for the company, it's about <strong>selling books</strong>. You have to be able to sell comics. Make sure you're good enough to stand out and contribute to the success of the titles you work on.</p>
