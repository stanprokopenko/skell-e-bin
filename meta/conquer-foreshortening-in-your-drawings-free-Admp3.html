<h2>What's in Premium?</h2>

<p>Learn how to master foreshortening in gesture drawing. This lesson covers techniques like shortening lines and emphasizing wraps to convey depth, maintaining rhythm in complex poses, and using asymmetry to prevent figures from feeling flat. You'll discover how to draw from the inside out by focusing on underlying forms. We'll address common challenges like drawing reclining poses and limbs coming toward the viewer, and show you how to use line weight and design elements to enhance your drawings. By embracing forward-backward projection and using gesture drawing as a notational tool, you'll be able to capture the essence of any pose.</p>
