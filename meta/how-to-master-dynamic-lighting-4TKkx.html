<h2>Static vs Dynamic Shapes</h2>

<p>In art, we often talk about <strong>static versus dynamic shapes</strong>. Static shapes are your basic forms like perfect squares, parallel lines, and perfect circles. These are primitive and straightforward. When you add perspective and energy to these shapes, they become dynamic. Dynamic shapes have a flow and energy, with a sense of pushing, pulling, and bending. Static characters and poses, with even hips and shoulders and symmetry, can be boring. This is how we first learn to draw because it's easier to understand. But dynamic characters, with energy flowing through their bodies, offer a completely different and more engaging look.</p>

<h2>Static vs Dynamic Lighting</h2>

<p>The concept of static and dynamic doesn't just apply to shapes, it also applies to <strong>lighting</strong>. Static lighting is even and flat, while dynamic lighting shows the energy of light. There are many components to light - </p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Direct light</strong> from the sun</li>

<li><strong>Shadowed sides</strong> of objects</li>

<li><strong>Ambient light</strong> that fills shadows</li>

<li><strong>Ambient occlusion</strong>, the contact point of soft shadows</li>

<li><strong>Indirect light</strong> that bounces off surfaces</li>

<li><strong>Specular highlights</strong> and reflections</li>

<li><strong>Secondary reflections</strong>, soft reflections not directly from the light source</li>

</ul>

<p>Dynamic lighting involves separating these components to show the energy and flow of light.</p>

<h2>Examples of Dynamic Lighting</h2>

<p>I took some photos of an egg to illustrate static versus dynamic lighting. Static lighting is even, while dynamic lighting shows a lit side, a dark side, bounce light, and specular highlights. Similarly, with a Dobby the house elf statue, flat lighting is static, but moving the light sources creates a dynamic effect. Changing the color temperature of lights, using warm and cool tones, enhances this dynamic quality.</p>

<h2>Dynamic Lighting in 3D and Film</h2>

<p>In 3D, I scanned Dobby's head and lit it both flatly and dynamically. Dynamic lighting, with rim lights and opposing sources, gives a different feeling. In film, dynamic lighting is often used to create mood and depth. For example, in "Dune" and "The Last of Us," lighting is used to highlight shapes, create depth, and focus the viewer's attention.</p>

<h2>Common Mistakes in Digital Painting</h2>

<p>A common mistake in digital painting is focusing on local color, rather than dynamic lighting. Painting objects in their local colors, red carpet, tan walls, brown wood, can result in flat images. Instead, think about how light affects these colors. Dynamic lighting can make scenes more appealing and believable.</p>

<h2>Practical Applications</h2>

<p>When painting interiors, use light to enhance appeal and believability. In illustrations, focus on light-centric rather than object-centric lighting. In film, light shapes form, creates depth, and directs focus. For example, in "Ratatouille," dynamic lighting was used to focus attention and create contrast.</p>

<h2>Dynamic Lighting in Nature and Photography</h2>

<p>In nature and photography, dynamic lighting is crucial. For instance, in the Columbia River Gorge or an Iceland geyser, contrast, separation, and composition are key. Dynamic lighting helps create images that are easier to understand and more visually appealing.</p>

<p>As artists, we should strive to apply dynamic lighting techniques in our compositions. Observing and understanding light is essential in creating engaging and believable art. Let's go out and paint, using these tools to enhance our original compositions.</p>
