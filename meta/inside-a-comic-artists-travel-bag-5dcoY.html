<p>My name is Daniel Warren Johnson, and this is my travel bag for conventions, commissions, or general travel. I love working with a variety of tools, each serving a unique purpose in my art process. Here's a detailed look at what I carry with me.</p>

<h2>Pens</h2>

<p><strong>Pigma 3.0</strong>

- Makes nice flat marks

- Very dry</p>

<p><strong>Pilot Parallel Pen</strong>

- Intense and bold

- Great for drawing straight lines and buildings

- Filled with custom ink because the original ink isn't good</p>

<p><strong>Micron 08</strong>

- My go-to pen

- Evolves as it ages</p>

<p><strong>Kuretake Number 13 Brush Pen</strong>

- Cool but the tip lasts only about a week</p>

<p><strong>Winsor &amp; Newton 1.0 Pen</strong>

- Bold and thick

- Durable tip, unlike the Micron 1.0</p>

<p><strong>Tombow Hard Brush Pen</strong>

- Unopened

- Great for intentional, slow lines</p>

<p><strong>Bic Crystal 1.6mm Ballpoint Pen</strong>

- Classic but gunky</p>

<p><strong>Signo Uniball Gel Pen</strong>

- The most opaque gel pen available</p>

<p><strong>Copic Multiliner 0.8</strong>

- Great for panel lining

- Durable tip but runs out of ink quickly</p>

<h2>Pencils and Graphite</h2>

<p><strong>Pentel 0.9 Pencil</strong>

- Tried and true

- I love the 0.9 size</p>

<p><strong>Neox Graphite</strong>

- Highly recommended</p>

<h2>Brushes</h2>

<p><strong>Pentel Aquash Brush</strong>

- Used for watercoloring on the go

- One of my favorite and most relaxing activities</p>

<p><strong>Pentel Brush Pen (Not Pocket Version)</strong>

- Great for filling in big black spots

- Doesn't hold well if erased over</p>

<p><strong>Pentel Pocket Brush Pen</strong>

- Delicate with a 50-50 chance of being solid

- Ink sometimes comes out too fast

- <strong>Pro tip</strong>: dry the ink on a paper towel before making a fine line</p>

<p><strong>Zebra Brush Pen</strong>

- Great ink

- Durable tip

- Waterproof</p>

<h2>Other Tools</h2>

<p><strong>10-Point Divider</strong>

- Used for perspective drawing and technical illustration

- Very helpful for drawing comics</p>

<p><strong>Blick Blade Cutter</strong>

- Used for cutting tones on the road</p>

<p><strong>AIN Japanese Erasers</strong>

- Usually used but currently out of stock

- The type of lead used is more important for erasing pencil lines over inks</p>

<p><strong>Presto Whiteout</strong>

- Thick and not acid-free

- Likely to yellow in 10 years

- Used daily</p>

<p><strong>Akashiya Thin Line Pen</strong>

- Okay but wobbly and dry</p>

<p>I love all my tools and use them frequently. Each one has a special place in my travel bag and helps me create my art wherever I go.</p>
