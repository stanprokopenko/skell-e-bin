<h2>What Are Filters?</h2>

<p>Filters are ideas or constraints I apply to help focus my drawing. A filter can be a real-world observation, like how objects get smaller in the distance, or how color and value become closer to the sky’s color the farther back it goes. It could also be more abstract, like deciding I’ll emphasize line over tone, or focusing on emotional content. By choosing different filters, I can alter the feel, style, and effectiveness of my work.</p>

<p>I can stack these filters, adding some and removing others to refine my personal voice. For example, I might remove most shadow details or eliminate background detail. This is similar to the way a Rembrandt painting sometimes frames its subject with deep, unadorned darkness. Those choices can shift the viewer’s attention and create a strong, unique style.</p>

<h2>Gesture and Structure</h2>

<p>In this demonstration, I focus on two main filters: <strong>gesture</strong> and <strong>structure</strong>.</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Gesture</strong> is the long-axis curve or the main movement down the form.</li>

<li><strong>Structure</strong> is the way I move around the form in space, deciding if I see it as a flat 2D shape or a solid 3D volume.</li>

</ul>

<p>When I practice gesture, I might ask if the line is too curved, or not curved enough, to capture the flow I want. Structure involves establishing length, width, and depth. I decide if I want the arm as a simple tube, box, or a combination of the two. These ideas guide my marks and help me see how to adjust angles, proportions, or overlaps as I draw.</p>

<h2>Changing the Process</h2>

<p>Sometimes I’ll change how I physically draw. I can slow down, make multiple light lines, or overlap strokes to get more precision. I can also choose a bolder, faster approach to capture energy, like a sword stroke by Zorro. By being <strong>consciously curious</strong> each time I adjust my process, I keep myself open to improvements. Instead of just sticking to a single method (“30-second gestures” or “10-minute constructions”), I experiment, refine, and evolve.</p>

<h2>Simplify and Iterate</h2>

<p><strong>When in doubt, simplify.</strong> Rather than tackling the entire figure, I might isolate the upper arm. That’s my filter: “draw just the tube of the upper arm.” I decide how it curves in space, whether it tilts toward or away from me, and experiment until I hit that “sweet spot.”</p>

<p>If I’m missing a sense of 3D volume, I’ll iterate again. I might make it a box instead of a tube, or do a hybrid shape, tubular at the top, boxy at the bottom. Each version helps me see new possibilities. If proportions feel off, I repeat the process with better proportions. If my marks look nervous, I focus on fluid lines. By iterating in many directions, I train my eyes and develop mastery.</p>

<h2>Three-Dimensional Tilt</h2>

<p>I like giving forms a slight tilt so I can better see their volume, rather than locking everything in the flat picture plane. For a box, I’ll angle it so I can see top and side planes. For a tube, I ensure its ellipses show the correct tilt. By exploring these tilts and overlaps, I practice conveying depth in my drawings.</p>

<h2>Putting It All Together</h2>

<p>All these steps, filters, simplifications, and iterations, allow me to</p>

<p>• Identify a clear idea (“the arm is a tube,” “the arm is a box”).<br />

• Compare each new line or mark to that idea.<br />

• Adjust and refine until it feels right.<br />

• Move on to the next filter or iteration.  </p>

<p>I don’t try to do everything at once. I practice piece by piece, stacking only as many filters as I can handle. Over time, I build more complex drawings by layering in new filters: value, light and shadow, or more sophisticated anatomical details.</p>

<p>By staying curious, simplifying when needed, and iterating often, I keep growing as an artist. This approach fuels deeper practice, encourages personal style, and helps me retain control over each stage of my drawings.</p>
