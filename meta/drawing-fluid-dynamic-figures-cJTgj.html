<p><strong>Welcome back! Today, you're going to delete the complex. ** Let's get rid of all that unnecessary stuff. You'll </strong>never draw a complex drawing**, instead, you'll build simple upon simple, and to the untrained eye, it'll look complex, but also beautiful and fluid.</p>

<h2>Embracing Simplicity and Gesture</h2>

<p>Keep that <strong>magic in your hands</strong>: the fluid idea of gesture connecting forms. Think of the <strong>bean bag</strong>, a classic that folds in the middle. You'll be doing a lot of folding and moving around, and there's no avoiding it.</p>

<h2>Learning to Love Hands</h2>

<p>And why should you avoid hands? <strong>Learn to love hands</strong>. Throw some hands in between figure drawings to shake things up and keep yourself fresh. It's easy to lose the power of drawing the hand if you only draw quick sketches where they're mostly sticks at the end of a pad.</p>

<h2>Building Confidence Through Mileage</h2>

<p>You'll explore anticipation and get your voice into these drawings. Remember, <strong>all the minutiae are there for you to explore</strong>. So get into it, have fun with it, and <strong>draw with the power of osmosis</strong>.</p>

<h3>Repeating Simple Shapes</h3>

<p><strong>Keep repeating the very simple shapes</strong> until you understand them well enough to take it to the next level. You can also go back to scratch and do the first lessons all over before you get here. <strong>Watch, listen, draw, repeat</strong> - that's the way to go.</p>

<h3>Gaining Confidence</h3>

<p>It's all about <strong>mileage</strong> to get you into the flow of drawing with incredible confidence and without fear. When you walk into a life drawing class, everything's terrifying. You don't know what's happening, the model's not the same as before. You can't see the bones, just the outline of the figure, and that's plenty for you.</p>

<h2>Focusing on Bones and Landmarks</h2>

<p>You can always see where the <strong>tenth rib</strong> is, where the <strong>hip crest</strong> is. So <strong>look for bones first</strong>. The head's always going to be an obvious thing because it's mostly bone. Remember, even in foreshortened views, <strong>Mr. T and Mrs. V</strong> are there for you.</p>

<h3>Understanding Anatomy Enhances Drawing</h3>

<p>Drawing the figure is eternal, it's never going to be the same pose, ever, not exactly. But what's always there for you is Mr. T and Mrs. V, even in very foreshortened views.</p>

<h2>Manipulating Line and Value</h2>

<p>One of the big gifts you have with what's seemingly limited tools is that you can make <strong>value, line, and proportion</strong> do whatever you want them to do, and the camera can't. The artist's voice is different every time.</p>

<h3>Using Broad and Thin Strokes</h3>

<p>You can use <strong>broad pencil strokes</strong> and then <strong>thin lines</strong> to create depth and realism. Within those broad strokes, it's easier to place smaller things. <strong>The viewer will fill it all in for you</strong>. And once again, that is the Holy Grail, where the artist only says enough, and then the viewer says the rest.</p>

<h2>Overcoming Challenges with Hands</h2>

<p><strong>Hands are hard</strong>, everyone acknowledges that. But the more you do them, the more you understand them in dimension, and the easier it is. So <strong>draw lots of hands</strong>. When you're designing the hand, think of it as thick, not a thin thing. Remember, <strong>simplify the most complicated thing</strong>. Make it as simple as you can.</p>

<h3>Understanding Proportions</h3>

<p>Think of <strong>half and half</strong> and then half again when laying out the hand. From the wrist down to the first big knuckle of the thumb is half and half to the end of the thumb. So basically, the thumb right down to where the wrist starts is just a bit longer than the longest finger from the mid-knuckle.</p>

<h2>Incorporating Rhythm and Storytelling</h2>

<p>Feel the <strong>rhythm</strong>, and the female figure is great for that. It's got the big hips, the tubular middle, and that beautiful swing into the waist. If you can think of a story for every character you're drawing, even if it's a live-draw character, you'll become so much more invested in it, and the action will flow more.</p>

<h3>Adding Anticipation</h3>

<p>You'll explore <strong>anticipation</strong>, and things like that. Give yourself a theme, maybe revenge or anticipation. Create intrigue by anticipating the next move.</p>

<h2>Loving the Process</h2>

<p>Remember, nobody's taking a measuring tool to your drawing. So think <strong>simple first</strong>. Enjoy the process. <strong>Mileage is magic</strong>. The more you draw, the better you can do it. Drawing is something you have to be very aware of as something that can stop being so keen in your mind. It needs to be constantly honed if you want to retain these skills and keep them fluid.</p>

<h3>Continuous Practice</h3>

<p>Keep drawing, and you'll come back to it. If you take a break, it's very hard to come back after that, but it all comes back. The process is the enjoyable part. If you're not enjoying the process, then you're not enjoying over 99% of the drawing to get to that very last moment where it's finished.</p>

<p>So, <strong>let's get into it, have fun with it, and draw with the power of osmosis</strong>. Good luck!</p>
