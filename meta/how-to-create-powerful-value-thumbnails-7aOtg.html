<h2>Exploring Value Compositions</h2>

<p>I'm working on <strong>value composition thumbnails</strong> for Level Two. I chose an image of a lady who appears to be begging or convincing someone. The way I compose the values can affect how the image feels, making her appear <strong>smaller and more vulnerable</strong> or <strong>larger</strong> depending on the composition.</p>

<h2>Materials and Setup</h2>

<p>I start with <strong>markers</strong> to quickly iterate through thumbnails, using the <strong>white of the paper as a third value</strong>. After selecting a thumbnail I like, I'll do a larger version with <strong>pencils</strong> for more control over the shapes. I'm using markers numbered <strong>9</strong> and <strong>5</strong>.</p>

<h2>First Thumbnail: Sticking to the Photo</h2>

<p>For the first thumbnail, I stick closely to the photo to understand it better. I simplify and <strong>abstract her shape</strong> into simple forms that capture her pose. There's a lot of space above her head, so I include that. When I squint, her <strong>face and fingertips</strong> are the brightest areas, which I'll represent as small light shapes. The rest of her body becomes a <strong>big dark shape</strong>, and the background is a <strong>mid-value</strong>.</p>

<h2>Second Thumbnail: Adding the Cast Shadow</h2>

<p>In the second thumbnail, I include the <strong>dark cast shadow</strong> behind her as a dark mass, merging it with her body. This creates a <strong>yin-yang composition</strong>, with a diagonal division across the canvas. It strengthens the focus on her face and hands by keeping our attention in the middle.</p>

<h2>Third Thumbnail: Lightening the Composition</h2>

<p>I experiment with a lighter overall composition by making the <strong>background white</strong> and the <strong>cast shadow a mid-value</strong>. I introduce some of the <strong>lights on her dress</strong>. However, I find that the lit drapery distracts from the focus on her face and hands. Simplifying the dress into darker values might be stronger.</p>

<h2>Experimenting with Cropping and Values</h2>

<p>I try a wider composition, placing her on the <strong>far left</strong> and making her a <strong>mid-value</strong> figure against a <strong>dark background</strong>. This shifts the emphasis and makes her feel more <strong>angelic</strong> but also changes the mood. Another version focuses more on the environment, but I prefer to keep the attention on her.</p>

<h2>Choosing the Final Composition</h2>

<p>After comparing the thumbnails, I decide to go with the last one, which combines elements I like. I plan to use <strong>five values</strong> in the larger drawing: the darks, mid-values, lights, and introduce a fourth and fifth value for added depth.</p>

<h2>Creating the Larger Drawing</h2>

<p>Using <strong>6B, HB, and 4H pencils</strong>, I redraw the composition with more accuracy. I label and plan my <strong>five values</strong>:</p>

<ol>

<li><strong>Darkest darks</strong> (value 1): her hair and the deepest shadows.</li>

<li><strong>Dark mid-values</strong> (value 2): details in her drapery.</li>

<li><strong>Mid-values</strong> (value 3): the cast shadow and parts of her face and hands.</li>

<li><strong>Light mid-values</strong> (value 4): the wall and lighter areas of her skin.</li>

<li><strong>Lightest lights</strong> (value 5): highlights on her face and fingertips.</li>

</ol>

<p>I fill in the darkest areas first, ensuring clean, sharp edges. I carefully render the mid-values and light values, keeping the composition balanced.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p>This process helps me refine the composition and focus on the most important elements, the <strong>face and hands</strong>. I made a few key changes from the photo, like darkening the bottom area, and emphasizing the cast shadow. Although not drastically different from the photo, these adjustments enhance the focus and mood I want to convey.</p>
