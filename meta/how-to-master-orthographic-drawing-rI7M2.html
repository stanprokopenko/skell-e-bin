<p>Hi everybody, here we are in the Proko studio for our critique on orthos. It's amazing how one can put out a project to the world and you out in the world respond with this kind of volume. Thank you.</p>

<h2>Understanding the Project Assignment</h2>

<p>I think, granted that you're watching this critique, you understand the project, which was to take something you like and <strong>draw it from at least two points of view that are at right angles to each other</strong>. Probably a third, fourth, or fifth point of view, so that you know it from all angles. This is to prepare you to draw it from an oblique angle.</p>

<h2>Challenges with Complex Objects</h2>

<h3>Vera Robson's Advanced Chair</h3>

<p>Let's take a look at someone who made it into a project that is like a finished illustration: <strong>Vera Robson</strong>. She feels she messed up the 3D image a bit and that wasn't part of the assignment. Well, it's okay because she chose an advanced object and colored it all in. Even though that was certainly not required for this assignment, it can get in the way because you're making it beautiful.</p>

<p>When you've got an object this complex that has curves in it, like the back of a chair making a curve, that curve in an ortho, especially when you're beginning, can give you grief. But let's take a look. We can see that the <strong>front view and the back view have the same silhouette, or should, because we are infinitely distant front and back</strong>. How do we know this is the front? Because the seat overlaps the back. How do we know this is the back? Because the back overlaps the seat. Otherwise, same silhouette.</p>

<p>We cannot tell from the front or back view that it is moving in or moving away from our eye. So, we need a side view that shows that center point. Granted that it is a center point. Whenever we're understanding curves, we want to understand straight lines. The more right-angled the straight line is, the easier it is to understand.</p>

<p>This is tipped back at an angle. Let's keep it simple and turn this into a flat and presumably vertical plane. If I want to find the center of that, I would run from corner to corner, the traditional dotted lines, to know where the center is, right there. Then I would run from that place back somewhere, maybe straight back or at an angle, but we have to find a way to do that in the oblique. We do know that line will not go that way or that way.</p>

<p>Why? Because the <strong>Z line on this chair is aiming up at a vanishing point</strong>. We're looking down on it, it's aiming up. So, that means the Z line here will go that way, and then if we found the center of that X line and the center of that height line, we would be able to create the curve that would let us find where that point is back in space. You did it very well, Vera. You landed on a good enough position to pull it off.</p>

<p>But I do not recommend to those of you who are working on this project to take it to this much finish. It might be better for you to do several of these, as some of you have, without coloring them in. Very good, though, and this was an advanced problem.</p>

<h3>The Role of Auxiliary Views</h3>

<p>Here's what engineers do when they have these kinds of problems: they create <strong>auxiliary views</strong>. We're not talking about an oblique view where we look at something from an angle that's not straight on. We're talking about the object itself having something in it that isn't right-angled and may have a pattern on it. So, we then create a separate ortho that gets the camera in there to look at a slanted plane.</p>

<p>There was an example in the free lesson of a birdhouse where I created an auxiliary view. Engineers do this all the time. You're not training to be engineers, but you are in the role of engineering students to get your head around this for a bit so that you'll be able to use it in your freehand drawing.</p>

<h2>Simplifying Objects for Orthographic Projections</h2>

<h3>Cheyenne's Bird Project</h3>

<p>Let's go to <strong>Cheyenne</strong>, who posted first. Good job, Cheyenne. We've got the top, then swiveled to the front, and then we could have swiveled in the same direction and shown the bottom, but you switched right to the back view, which is fine. In fact, there's an advantage to it. It gives us a chance to compare the front and the back, which I'll get to in a moment, and then the underneath view.</p>

<p>Now, these wing things. When you place these into oblique views, which you did thoughtfully and with nice reversals, I want to show you something that makes perfect sense. If our eye is in the center here, that this form is going away from us to our left, and therefore, a curve like that using the blob approach, a curve like that, a curve like that, a curve like that, would make it so that when we snap these tight, we would be looking at forms that are moving away from our eye as they go to our left.</p>

<p>However, look at what's happening over here. Depending on how close we are to this thing, a proximity issue, this may be doing the opposite. This may be coming toward us like this, and this portion would be going away from us, like we saw earlier. That creates a complication because you've got a number of obliques, as well as an organic form here.</p>

<p>But here's the point that I am making, How would we know that this would be coming toward us possibly and that would be going away from us unless we had a <strong>top or a bottom view</strong> to show us the forward on Z, that is, forward on Z as well as out on X? Here again, we've got this going away from us, and going away from us still.</p>

<p>Now, I should mention that a great deal of this depends on how close we are. We'll be getting to that. This very well may be going away from us, depending on whether the thing is pulling its wings back. By the way, in case you didn't know it, bird wings, that is, a wrist and an elbow, it's back here, and you can see this shoulder blade on bats and birds is there on the side. It goes back to an elbow, forward to a wrist, and then those end up being fingers that go out from there.</p>

<p>Look at how on this front view, they are going away here, and they are going away here. On this back view, it looks as if they are going forward and then coming back, going forward and then very, very subtly coming back. These are beautifully developed with all the detail. Thank you again, Cheyenne.</p>

<h3>Front and Back Views: Same Silhouette</h3>

<p>Now we'll move to this front and back thing. We talked about on Vera's piece how you can tell that one is from the front because of what overlaps, and what is on the back because of what overlaps. But what we didn't mention is that the <strong>front view and the back view, just like these two side views, even if they have different things on them, will be exactly the same silhouette</strong>.</p>

<p>Why? Because the camera's a million miles back, zoomed in, and so if you put it in the dark, whichever side you are, it will be the same silhouette that blocks out the light behind it.</p>

<p>We can see a rough and perfect example of this in <strong>Melanie Skierce's animated shoe</strong>, which, if we look at the turnaround, we can see that one side or the other, back or front, are exactly the same shape. Three-quarter going away one direction or the other direction or from the front will have the same silhouette, granted they are in the same degree of rotation.</p>

<p>Now, I should mention that won't happen in real life, and it will not happen with your eyes when you are working from an object, especially when you're close to it. If you know <strong>Stephen Peck's anatomy book</strong>, Peck's anatomy book has a rendering of a skull from different positions. If the widest part of the human face, even the head, the parietal eminence, is very wide, the zygomatic arch is typically the widest part of the skull. If you can see it in silhouette from looking underneath it, you should be able to see it from looking down on it in an ortho. But if you've got it there in front of you and it's close enough, looking down on it, the cranium will swell, and it might block it out.</p>

<p>Now, I think that's because Peck was working from a model as you were. Some of you mentioned how hard this was and took photographs of it and still had trouble. If you're going to do this from a photograph, you've got to get on the other side of the room and zoom in to flatten it out into the view that we want. The idea is that in an ortho, <strong>no diminution, everything stays its constant size</strong>.</p>

<h2>Projection Techniques</h2>

<h3>Melanie's Shoe and Projection</h3>

<p>Melanie also did an awesome projection where she placed the top ortho above and then tracked the lines down to find out where things would go. In a few lessons, group 10, we're going to do this projection thing in a more complicated way through a picture plane. But this is a rudimentary way to project by just rotating at any position you want, running the lines down for your oblique view, and then you've got the positions of each of these.</p>

<p>We're still an infinite distance from this. There will be no diminution. There are no receding lines that converge to vanishing points. This would be harder to do if you were to tip this corner down, but we'll take that up in lesson group 10. You might want to look these over and understand the logic and even dare to try your own.</p>

<h3>Discussing Rick B's Question</h3>

<p>And, by the way, thank you Melanie for explaining things to others, like your response to <strong>Rick B</strong>. Rick B did the pencil sharpener and noticed the relationship between that and an image from an uncredited artist who should be credited. Melanie made the distinction between a drawing that is in perspective and a drawing that is out of perspective.</p>

<p>Let's look at Rick B's question:</p>

<blockquote>

<p><strong>"Why did looking at my lead sharpener for a second try at an orthographic drawing inspire so much fear in me? Could be childhood issues. I just about hyperventilated looking at the detail on this little thing. I will be working on this tomorrow. Mama did not raise no quitter. At this moment, I have no clue how to get started on this. I'll look at it in the morning and it might not look as difficult as my mind made it out to be tonight."</strong></p>

</blockquote>

<p>You're bringing up a secret. In that interview that <strong>Adam Guettel did with Stephen Sondheim</strong>, this genius dogmatically asserted that **"I am a firm believer in the sleeping on, the dream mind."] Giving yourself the problem before you go to sleep and letting your dream mind work on it. ** It's a good thing, and geniuses do stuff like that.</p>

<p>But that's another issue. What I want to focus on now is the third picture. That's this one from the uncredited artist, who we want to find out who did it, and that you noticed that it was like this. You found this bit of awesomeness while on a search for how to transfer measurements to a cylinder in perspective. Not a clue who did this, as all the results of the picture search came out in Russia, and you think it is very cool and would like to crack the perspective and draw it sometime in the near future once you figure out how.</p>

<p>Let us do that. Rick, you did see that even though the proportions of how this cylinder is divided up are different on these, they are essentially the same thing but with less valley in there. That would be an ellipse that would go all the way around, just like the ellipse that goes all the way around for the front lip, and everything would connect. There would be a point in the center of the circle that the center line of each of these blocks would aim to, a vanishing point that way, and these would aim to the same vanishing point because they are parallel. But these lines would not aim to the center, their vanishing point is not in the center. We will take that up, it is so advanced.</p>

<p>But before dealing with those technical problems, to be able to see that one is like the other is a creative leap.</p>

<h2>Simplifying Complex Objects</h2>

<h3>Randy Pontillo's Pneumatic Scissors</h3>

<p><strong>Randy Pontillo</strong> was second to post, and you did this freehand. Good. Good for your brain, good for your hand. I want to point something out. That's the bottom view, that's the top view, that's the back view, and that's the front view. But see, these pneumatic scissors, this thing that angles off like that to one side, that will affect how it looks over here. This is exactly the kind of thing that could use an <strong>auxiliary view</strong>. If we are looking at it from this side over here, that would be going away from us. If we are looking at it from this side over here, this would be coming toward us. You took on a tough one, thanks for showing.</p>

<h3>Spiridon's Sofa</h3>

<p><strong>Spiridon's</strong> sofa, if your name is pronounced <strong>Spiridon</strong>, let me know. Here's what you did well in your choice of subject matter, you chose something that had <strong>all right angles</strong>. It does make things simpler, and it also does take some thinking. The height of this part back here from the right and the left, we see there's a sliver of high part, but we don't know where it is. It's not here. Oh, it's the middle part. When you do your oblique, you will clarify that because you know from having seen which parts project and which parts do not exist in that area.</p>

<p>This is the blueprint of what you'll do in the build, whether you draw it or actually build it. In fact, these always used to be done as blueprints way back in the day, which was a technical reason for how they printed orthos on paper for architects. Not important here but interesting if you want to look it up.</p>

<p>Now, granted that that was your real sofa and this business of working from the object. That's the way we're doing this project, but you can do it in reverse, which is how it is normally done for practical purposes. Think of why this evolved. In the first place, to draw something you can build, and so you know, that airplane I drew was not a model that I drew from. I drew the orthos, and Stan had a modeler build it. Those of you who work in 3D programs and are familiar with all this don't have to draw orthos.</p>

<p>But I've been around enough 3D modelers to know that when they are coming up with their own ideas, they tend to draw them out this way, from different views. And 3D modelers, like concept artists who give them these ideas, work from orthos. When you're learning this, starting this way with pure right-angled objects and simplifications is not only a sensible way to learn, we're trying to be more than sensible, we're trying to gain skill. So, if we're trying to gain skill, always, always look back and forth to imagine this as swiveling on X and swiveling on Y. You compare not only the direct swivels, but if that is a depth measurement, this should be the same depth measurement. If this is a depth measurement, this should be the same. And if this is a width measurement and this is a width measurement, this width here and this width up here will be the same.</p>

<h2>Simplifying Curves and Obliques</h2>

<h3>Dave Sakamoto's Simplified Car</h3>

<p>We're going to take a little time with <strong>Dave Sakamoto</strong>. Dave, this is the perfect way to think, simplifying it into mostly right angles. Something as complex as this car with all those oblique angles and those curves has been reduced, so the only oblique angles to speak of, such as this one, go back on Z while they go up on Y. Notice that they do not do what happens on the car, I think, it looks like it, that they also would go in on X a little bit, which makes them more difficult to draw. But that is exactly what you'll be doing in our next lesson group, naming the directions that these oblique lines go.</p>

<p>Now, here is another advantage of this, not just that you've simplified it into mostly right angles with a few simple leaning lines, but also that if you want to <strong>find the center point</strong> of this flat plane, it is so easy to do because you can see the diagonals from corner to corner, and you will know that where they meet will be the center, so that this and this would be the same. It is not anything like that easy when it becomes curved.</p>

<p>This is doing the same kind of thing that Vera's, the back of Vera's chair, was doing, although hers was curving concave to the front. This is, I assume, straight down, but to find the center line means that we would have to say this is the side close to us. Over on the other side is the one far away, and where would the center line be? It would be way over there.</p>

<p>Now, look what's happened. This is all the right side, and the peak of the curve as it goes around there, and that is all the left side, which is going around the bend. Curves are different from flat planes, and the way we get to them is by doing what you have done, Dave, getting this simplified blocky version first. As you study this way, you are reaching toward that.</p>

<h3>Daniela's Chainsaw</h3>

<p><strong>Daniela</strong> took on a chainsaw, brave. The chainsaw was a bit more than I could chew. It's an unusual thing to chew, but it's up to you.</p>

<h3>Smithies' Duplos</h3>

<p><strong>Smithies' Duplos</strong> - very good for this project because you could never guess, unless you knew from this side or this front or this back or this other side view, that these are round. We need another view for that. Good choice. One thing that can help you to remember that a perfectly rectangular shape is a circular form is to do the sound effect, the Doppler of "voom," as you go across there. But I've done that plenty, and I hope you have been too.</p>

<h3>Dan the Animator's Coffee Cup</h3>

<p>Now, <strong>Dan the Animator's coffee cup</strong>, oddly, when you round the corners on something, it might, just out of the power of suggestion, make you recognize that this is a circular form. There's no logic to it. That could be a flat piece of sheet metal, it happens to have rounded corners. But we'll take up more in our next critique on this business of suggestion.</p>

<p>Here's what's important for what we're doing here, the <strong>distance</strong> of where this curved corner begins and the distance between the outside edge and the inside maybe should be the same distance, but maybe not. It may be that this is telling us that it doesn't cut in until further toward the center, and if that is the case, I think it is the case, oh my goodness, I think you are. You're showing us with this dotted line that there will be some flat ridge up there, before it starts going down.</p>

<p>The important thing is that each one of these isolated views has a relationship to the others.</p>

<h3>Lucy's Coffee Pot</h3>

<p><strong>Lucy</strong> stood out for this coffee pot, look at those clean lines.</p>

<h3>Smithies' Piggy Bank</h3>

<p>As <strong>Smithies</strong> pointed out about this piggy bank, that if these front legs are perfectly on an X-line, then in this side view, one would overlap the other just perfectly because there is no diminution in an ortho. It will be the same size, lined up artificially and usefully. Now, if the piggy is in motion and has one limb in front of another as we do when we walk, that is legitimate. That's what you want to include in the side view, but it would also be consistent with that bottom view.</p>

<h3>Encouraging Comments</h3>

<p><strong>Brandon</strong> is playing a starring role, <strong>Cheyenne</strong>, <strong>Daria</strong>, <strong>Glenn Hughes</strong>, <strong>Amu</strong>.</p>

<h2>The Importance of Comparing Views</h2>

<p>For those of you who scour your own orthos and find discrepancies, you may want to spend extra time on this portion of the course. I know it's challenging, but every one of these is solvable. Start with simpler objects until you get it. They are solvable, and they are valuable, but they take work in one way. They're about <strong>how little do we need to understand a form</strong>. Hone it down only to the most necessary information, and that's what this is about.</p>

<p>Now, regarding subject matter, let's scroll through what we've got here. Many of you chose things that are familiar, and you found that what you thought was familiar was actually a whole new set of dimensions, literally. The familiar becomes strange. That's one way to work from stuff you already know, so that you can know it in a new way.</p>

<p>Another way to approach it is to work from stuff that you want to know, to make the strange familiar. If you're on a project that has any particular subject matter that you want to learn to draw, take it on. I did it with an anvil, a couple lessons from now. It's kind of fun and a reminder.</p>

<h2>Emphasizing the Learning Process</h2>

<p>You are not doing these because the world needs more of them. This is not for the world. <strong>This is for you so that you can offer your ideas to the world in grown-up form.</strong></p>

<p>Now, one last point. This working from an object into an ortho is all very scientific. It is quantifiable. It's left brain. There's really not much creative about it. Our next lesson on <strong>inventing new forms from orthos</strong> is also scientific, but there's a big difference. This was letting the object dictate your choices. In the ortho puzzles to come, you can have a hundred solutions that are all different and all correct. I stretched myself into about seven or eight new inventions. When I looked at what you've posted, you did way more and some that I never thought of. That'll be the creative part.</p>
