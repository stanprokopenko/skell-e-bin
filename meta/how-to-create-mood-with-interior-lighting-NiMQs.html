<h2>Understanding Interiors vs. Exteriors</h2>

<p>When painting interiors, <strong>the approach differs significantly from exteriors</strong>. Interiors lack the same atmospheric and weather effects. Instead, we need to make deliberate choices about <strong>light sources</strong>, considering both <strong>electric and natural light</strong>. Factors like <strong>window placement</strong> and <strong>time of day</strong> heavily influence the scene. <strong>Ambient light</strong> and <strong>ambient occlusion</strong> play a crucial role in adding depth and detail.</p>

<h2>Planning the Scene</h2>

<p>I start with <strong>a simple, scribbly sketch</strong> to capture the basic idea. This rough sketch is more about planning the space, not detailing. For complex interiors, I often <strong>mock up the scene in 3D software</strong> like Maya. Using basic shapes, cubes, cylinders, spheres, I build the main structures, walls, windows, staircases. This helps me <strong>establish accurate perspective</strong> without manually tracking it.</p>

<h2>Blocking in Values with Ambient Occlusion</h2>

<p>With the basic layout, I begin <strong>blocking in general values</strong>, focusing on ambient occlusion. Under areas like stairs and in recesses, I paint <strong>soft shadows</strong> to indicate where light is occluded. This establishes the <strong>overall lighting mood</strong> and helps define the depth in the scene.</p>

<h2>Choosing Light Sources</h2>

<p>Deciding on <strong>light sources</strong> is crucial. Do I want strong sunlight streaming through windows, or a soft, diffused light on an overcast day? For a moody atmosphere, <strong>cool light from the sky</strong> with minimal sunlight can create dramatic contrasts. I might also consider how <strong>fog effects</strong> within the room can interact with the light, adding mystery and depth.</p>

<h2>Utilizing References</h2>

<p>I look at <strong>reference images</strong> to inform my lighting choices. Scenes from movies like <em>All Quiet on the Western Front</em> or <em>Skyfall</em> showcase excellent use of interior lighting with fog and specular highlights. These references help me visualize how light interacts with different surfaces and atmospheres.</p>

<h2>Building Up the Lighting</h2>

<p>Working underneath my line art, I start painting the <strong>ambient light</strong>. I focus on how light from windows or other openings <strong>illuminates the space</strong>, considering the presence of fog or mist. Using layers with blending modes like <strong>"Linear Dodge (Add)"</strong>, I add <strong>glowing effects</strong> around light sources to simulate the soft diffusion of light in the room.</p>

<h2>Adding Focal Points</h2>

<p>Elements like a <strong>dragon sculpture</strong> or a <strong>character entering the room</strong> serve as focal points. By placing them against brighter backgrounds or silhouetting them against windows, I draw the viewer's eye. <strong>High contrast</strong> between these elements and their surroundings emphasizes their importance in the scene.</p>

<h2>Considering Materials and Specular Highlights</h2>

<p>At this stage, I think about <strong>materials</strong> within the scene. Are the floors <strong>wooden or marble</strong>? Do surfaces have a <strong>polished finish</strong>? Materials affect how light interacts with objects, creating <strong>specular highlights</strong>. I add these highlights to indicate shiny surfaces and to enhance the realism of the scene.</p>

<h2>Introducing Local Color</h2>

<p>With the lighting established, I begin adding <strong>local color</strong>. In a scene dominated by cool light, colors like reds will appear more muted and may shift toward purples. By adjusting the saturation and hue slightly, I ensure that colors <strong>feel natural within the lighting context</strong>.</p>

<h2>Refining Details</h2>

<p>I continue to <strong>refine the scene</strong>, adding ambient occlusion around doorways, picture frames, and other architectural details. I make sure that even without the line art, <strong>the scene reads clearly</strong>, and all elements are understandable. This involves balancing values and ensuring that key elements stand out.</p>

<h2>Experimenting with Additional Light Sources</h2>

<p>To enhance the composition, I experiment with <strong>additional light sources</strong>:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Warm interior lights</strong> from lamps can create a cozy atmosphere.</li>

<li><strong>Glow from objects</strong>, like a magical orb, adds interest and directs attention.</li>

<li><strong>Sunlight pools</strong> can introduce dynamic shadows and highlights.</li>

<li><strong>Top-down lighting</strong> can help characters stand out against darker backgrounds.</li>

</ul>

<p>Each lighting experiment changes the mood and focus of the scene, so I choose the one that best fits the story I want to tell.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p>Painting interior scenes is all about <strong>mastering light and atmosphere</strong>. By understanding how light interacts with different materials and using ambient occlusion effectively, we can create compelling and believable spaces. I encourage you to <strong>explore different lighting setups</strong>, study references, and practice incorporating these techniques into your own work.</p>
