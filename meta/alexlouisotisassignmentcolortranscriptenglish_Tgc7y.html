<p>We've learned a lot about color in this section of the course. Now it's time for you to put that knowledge into practice with some assignments. These tasks are designed to reinforce your understanding and help you apply the concepts we've discussed.</p>

<p><strong>Assignment Part 1: Monochromatic Painting</strong></p>

<p>First, paint a sphere using a <strong>monochromatic palette</strong>. You can use red like I did, or experiment with a hue of your own choosing. Try creating a series of monochromatic paintings to see what different feelings and emotions different colors bring. This will act as a warm-up for the second part of our assignment.</p>

<p><strong>Assignment Part 2: Repainting with Different Color Palettes</strong></p>

<p>Once you're warmed up, go online and choose some paintings you admire. Create some line work from these pieces, and try repainting them using different color palettes:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Complementary palette</strong></li>

<li><strong>Split complementary palette</strong></li>

<li><strong>Four-color palette</strong></li>

</ul>

<p>When you do this, make sure to keep the same overall lighting as the original artist, only changing the colors according to your new palette.</p>

<p><strong>Submission Guidelines and Critique</strong></p>

<p>Be sure to post your finished studies along with the references you've used. These will be the pieces that I'll critique later.</p>

<p>We've talked a lot about color here in this session. Good luck with your assignments, and I'll see you soon.</p>
