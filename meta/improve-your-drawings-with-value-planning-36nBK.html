<p>I'm working on the designing value groups project. I have a beautiful cast in front of me, and I'm using a photo so you can follow along with the same reference. In this demo, I'll be using <strong>graphite</strong>, and occasionally switching to <strong>charcoal</strong> to speed things up. We're at the point in the course where we've learned a lot of concepts, and now we're putting them all together and adding one more on top.</p>

<p>When shading something, you still have to get the <strong>proportions</strong> right. You need to think about <strong>gesture</strong>, <strong>rhythms</strong>, <strong>shape design</strong>, <strong>form</strong>, <strong>structure</strong>, <strong>perspective</strong>, <strong>values</strong>, and <strong>composition</strong>. All these things now apply to this one drawing. You have to go through these steps, thinking about all these elements.</p>

<p>Eventually, you'll get to the point where you're combining all these things into one, and you can start right into shading. Some people start by mapping in the shadows with the side of their pencil, thinking about the gesture of the shadows, and then they mold it into a sculpture. You'll develop these skills over time, but until then, you might have to go in stages. That's typically how I demonstrate as well.</p>

<h2>Mapping in the Proportions</h2>

<p>I'm starting by <strong>mapping things in</strong> and trying to get the proportions right. I realize I haven't left enough space for myself because the width of the head would make the chin way off the page. So, I made it too big right off the bat. I decide to <strong>take some measurements</strong>.</p>

<p>I take the <strong>width of the beard</strong> right under the nose and use it as a unit of measure. I notice that the width fits twice into the height from the top of the head to the bottom of the beard, plus a little more for the hook at the bottom. This helps me adjust my drawing to fit on the page.</p>

<p>I mark the bottom of the nose and estimate where the brow ridge is. Usually, from the bottom of the nose to the brow ridge is about halfway to the top of the head. I'm drawing lightly because many of these construction lines will be erased later when I start getting my values in.</p>

<h2>Simplifying Shapes and Finding Rhythms</h2>

<p>Before I start adding details, it's useful to define the <strong>cheekbone rhythm</strong>, which is the separation between the front plane and the side plane. This was an important part of the box of the head we studied earlier. I use <strong>rhythms</strong> to connect various parts of the face, like how the angle of the cheekbone connects to other features.</p>

<p>I'm drawing <strong>major angles</strong> and trying to see where lines hit other features. I think about the gesture and flow of the beard, how it connects to the face, and the overall structure. I'm simplifying complex shapes into simpler ones, like big sweeping lines to create simple shapes.</p>

<h2>Considering Style and Linework</h2>

<p>I'm drawing with <strong>multiple lines</strong> for some of my lines, mostly so you can see it better. I don't always do this, but it makes it easier for the camera to pick up my lines. You don't necessarily have to copy me. Some artists use a bunch of lines and are very expressive in their lay-ins, while others are very precise with one line. These are just <strong>styles</strong>, and they really don't matter as long as you're conveying the structure.</p>

<p>It's important to separate stylistic choices from fundamental concepts that will make your drawing better or worse. You can intentionally do things differently because you're designing it in a way that improves some other aspect.</p>

<h2>Adjusting Proportions</h2>

<p>I realize that my drawing is still too skinny. When you look at your drawing from an angle, it can distort your perception. So, I double-check my proportions by measuring from the top of the head to the bottom of the nose and comparing it to other measurements in the face. <strong>If it feels wrong, it's wrong</strong>, so I adjust it.</p>

<p>I make sure to map out key features like the center line, the angles of the facial features, and where certain elements like the hair or beard hit the face. I'm constantly adjusting my drawing to ensure accuracy.</p>

<h2>Mapping in Shadow Shapes</h2>

<p>Now, I'm starting to <strong>map in the shadow shapes</strong>. I'm outlining all the shadows, and I'll fill them in later. This is called <strong>shadow mapping</strong>. I'm not considering the edge too much right now, I'm just mapping in the right shape.</p>

<p><strong>Squinting</strong> is extremely important at this stage. When you squint, everything within the large groups molds together into one big shape. It helps you see the simplified values and shapes.</p>

<p>As I map in the shadows, I'm simplifying complex areas into simple shapes. For example, I might simplify a soft edge into a straight line if it helps define the form better.</p>

<h2>Filling in the Shadows</h2>

<p>I'm moving on to fill in the shadows. I've been working with an <strong>H pencil</strong>, and now I'm switching to a <strong>4B</strong> to fill in the shadow shapes more quickly. I'm going to fill in the big shadow areas, excluding any light shapes within them for now.</p>

<p>I'm using a <strong>blending stump</strong> to soften some of the texture. When you use a blending stump, it <strong>darkens</strong> the area a bit because it moves the graphite into the texture of the paper.</p>

<p>At this stage, I'm working with only <strong>two values</strong>: the white of the paper and the shadow value I've applied. This is the <strong>notan stage</strong> of the drawing.</p>

<h2>Establishing the Value Range</h2>

<p>Before I get into the background shadows, I'm going to come in with a <strong>darker pencil</strong> and map in some of the <strong>darkest darks</strong>. I'm establishing my full value range on the paper. Now I have my white (the paper) and my black (the darkest darks), which helps me judge my whole value range.</p>

<p>I'm adding dark accents in places like the mouth, the hair, and other areas where I see the darkest values. This makes my shadows feel lighter in comparison and gives me room to add more darks throughout to sculpt the forms within the shadows.</p>

<h2>Simplifying Details for the Focal Point</h2>

<p>I'm simplifying the eye area by filling in a dark shape rather than drawing detailed eyes. By throwing in the dark shape I see, it feels like there's an eye there without focusing on the details. This helps me avoid spending too much time on the eyes and allows me to adjust them easily later if needed.</p>

<h2>Using Charcoal Powder for the Background</h2>

<p>To speed up the process of filling in large areas of shadow, I'm using <strong>charcoal powder</strong>. I'm careful about mixing graphite and charcoal because they <strong>reflect light differently</strong>. I mostly use charcoal to fill in mid-tone shadows and avoid using it for dark accents with graphite.</p>

<p>Using a <strong>brush</strong>, I apply the charcoal powder to create <strong>soft transitions</strong> and avoid texture. It allows me to unify large shadow areas without having to fill them in with a pencil, which would take much longer.</p>

<p>I'm careful to maintain the shapes I've established, making sure not to lose important edges or forms. I can also use softer brushes to create lighter halftones by picking up a small amount of charcoal powder.</p>

<h2>Unifying Values and Controlling Contrast</h2>

<p>I'm thinking about my drawing in terms of <strong>five values</strong>:</p>

<ol>

<li><strong>Value 1</strong>: The darkest darks (black)</li>

<li><strong>Value 2</strong>: Dark shadows</li>

<li><strong>Value 3</strong>: Dark halftones</li>

<li><strong>Value 4</strong>: Light halftones</li>

<li><strong>Value 5</strong>: The lightest lights (white of the paper)</li>

</ol>

<p>I want to <strong>unify areas by dropping them into a particular value</strong> to control contrast and avoid distractions. For example, I'm knocking back the beard area into a darker halftone so that the highlights in the beard don't distract from the focal point.</p>

<p>By unifying values in large areas, I can prevent small details from becoming distracting. It helps <strong>guide the viewer's eye</strong> to the intended focal point.</p>

<h2>Adjusting Edges and Adding Highlights</h2>

<p>I'm using an <strong>eraser</strong> to pick out highlights and adjust edges. The <strong>kneaded eraser</strong> works well for this because it can be shaped into different forms. I'm drawing with the eraser to bring back the lightest values where needed.</p>

<p>I'm also considering the <strong>edges</strong> in my drawing. Some areas have sharp edges where forms meet, and other areas have soft transitions. By adjusting edges, I can enhance the three-dimensional feel of the drawing.</p>

<h2>Finalizing the Level One Drawing</h2>

<p>At this point, I've established my value groups and simplified the drawing with clear shapes and values. For <strong>level one</strong>, this is where I'd have you stop. The drawing is simplified with occasional soft edges and controlled contrasts. The focal point is clear, and the composition works well.</p>

<h2>Moving to Level Two</h2>

<p>Now, I'm going to jump into what <strong>level two</strong> should do. I'll start adding more values and refining the details. I won't limit myself to the five basic values anymore. I'll keep the strong composition, but now I'll work on bringing the drawing to a finish with more subtle variations in value and more detailed rendering.</p>
