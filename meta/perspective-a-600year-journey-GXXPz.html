<h2>The Origins of Perspective in Italy</h2>

<p>Perspective started in <strong>Florence, Italy</strong>, about <strong>600 years ago</strong>. The <strong>Florentines</strong> figured it out, and from there, it spread to <strong>Northern Europe</strong>, the rest of Europe, the <strong>United States</strong>, <strong>Japan</strong>, and eventually the entire world. Now, perspective reigns supreme in the consciousness of all human beings, even if they don't know how to use it.</p>

<p>In the early days, teachers who taught perspective were often cranky because they were teaching, not drawing. Books made things easier, and now we have video. Aren't you glad you weren't born in a previous century?</p>

<h3>Uccello and His Work</h3>

<p>Ancient artists drew in all sorts of ways, but it wasn't until the <strong>15th century</strong> that <strong>Paolo Uccello</strong>, a Florentine Italian, drew this remarkable piece. You'll understand it thoroughly when we study ellipses and measure around circles. Look at how computer-generated it looks, and he drew it <strong>500 years before computers</strong>.</p>

<h3>Leonardo da Vinci's Studies</h3>

<p>Another Florentine, <strong>Leonardo da Vinci</strong>, drew this perspective study. There is much to learn from this:</p>

<ul>

<li>The <strong>freedom of the pen strokes</strong> that comes from mastering pen strokes.</li>

<li>The <strong>process of preliminary work</strong> to prepare finished work.</li>

<li>The appeal to some of us of <strong>unfinished work</strong>.</li>

<li>The <strong>story</strong> he's telling.</li>

</ul>

<p>But we're here for one main lesson: <strong>This is a perspective study</strong>. He's placing imaginary space. The lines on the ground are a grid to track how far back a figure moves in space by moving up in the picture. He made up those lines. He liked the rhythm of things getting smaller in this picture.</p>

<p>He could have gridded it like this, or like that. We'll learn about those differences when we study <strong>lenses and proximity</strong>, how close we are to a scene. This is preliminary work. Those lines may not even be seen in the painting. They are his way of working out where things will go in this scene, before painting.</p>

<p>That's creative work, but there's a lot of pure technical work here. He was not just thinking about the room in perspective but about the <strong>animals and the people</strong>.</p>

<h2>Spread of Perspective to Northern Europe</h2>

<h3>Albrecht D端rer's Contributions</h3>

<p>The knowledge of perspective spread to Germany through <strong>Albrecht D端rer</strong>, who not only drew in perspective but also drew pictures to <strong>explain perspective</strong>. Here he shows that light beams become dots on a window, and connecting the dots gives you a drawing of the object in perspective. We will study that so that you know how it works.</p>

<p>But most of this course is about the skill in <strong>making stuff up</strong>, which D端rer did.</p>

<h2>The Dutch Masters and Perspective</h2>

<h3>De Vries's Paintings and Drawings</h3>

<p>Let's move about a hundred years closer to us. <strong>Jan de Vries</strong>, who was Dutch, loved perspective so much that he did the same kinds of things over and over. These are his paintings, but we are not studying painting as such, only the lines that lead to it.</p>

<p>These are his drawings. What can we learn from them?</p>

<p>First, they are not complex. They are <strong>simple perspective</strong>. You can analyze that in a minute.</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>One-point perspective</strong> - face-on, horizontal lines, vertical lines, receding lines. Spread things out and distortion, we'll deal with that later.</li>

<li><strong>Two-point perspective</strong>: a corner where two sets of lines go away to their points.</li>

</ul>

<p>That's pretty simple if you know where those points are.</p>

<p>Visible <strong>horizon lines</strong>, we have a whole episode on horizon lines, visible or not. These are obvious. Things that project out, things that recess in, basic stuff here.</p>

<p>These are the first things we learn. In fact, these little stages can be used for perspective exercises. You can even try now if you're antsy. Draw characters, imagine them acting out scenarios, and keep track of them in space. Templates for your own SimCity.</p>

<h2>The Widespread Adoption of Perspective</h2>

<p><strong>Uccello</strong>, <strong>Da Vinci</strong>, <strong>D端rer</strong>, <strong>De Vries</strong> - many others. Word got around. Perspective went pretty much everywhere. Let's move a hundred years closer.</p>

<p>Look at those dates. By this time, <strong>perspective was part of every European artist's education</strong>. They learned it the way you learn reading and writing. And this was a hundred years before any human being ever saw a photograph. <strong>Artists were magicians</strong>.</p>

<h2>Changes in the 19th and 20th Centuries</h2>

<h3>Photography and Its Impact</h3>

<p>In the <strong>19th century</strong>, photography came in and changed the world. <strong>Impressionists</strong> started to focus on light the way a camera does. <strong>Expressionists</strong> started to bend perspective, reject restraints, and express their joy in doing so.</p>

<h3>Japanese Woodblock Artists</h3>

<p>Japanese woodblock artists took perspective and ran with it. In the <strong>20th century</strong>, <strong>Hiroshi Yoshida</strong> created some of the most beautiful prints. Their beauty goes beyond perspective, but as perspective, they are impeccable, not just buildings, but <strong>organic forms</strong> and <strong>water</strong>.</p>

<h2>Perspective in Modern Art Forms</h2>

<p>During the 20th century, the fine art world and universities in the US pretty much <strong>abandoned perspective</strong>. But <strong>comic book artists</strong>, <strong>animators</strong>, many <strong>illustrators</strong>, and even some <strong>graphic designers</strong> loved it and used it.</p>

<p>Look up <strong>M.C. Escher</strong> for some of the great work of the 20th century, pre-computer perspective masterpieces.</p>

<p><strong>Perspective - the great discovery from way back when</strong>. Those were artists I like. You have yours. Countless more await. <strong>Dig for treasure</strong>.</p>
