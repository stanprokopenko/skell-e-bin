<h2>What is Value in Art?</h2>

<p>In art, <strong>value</strong> refers to how <strong>light or dark</strong> something is. It's not about worth or cost. If you take a photo and make it grayscale, you'll notice differences in values—the skin might be lighter than the lips, but sometimes different colors can have similar values.</p>

<h2>Lines vs. Values</h2>

<p>While we've learned a lot about lines, remember that <strong>lines aren't real</strong>. We don't actually see lines; we see light affecting forms. Lines are an abstraction we use to represent the edges of shapes. In reality, what we see is an arrangement of colors filling shapes.</p>

<h2>The Components of Color</h2>

<p>Color consists of <strong>hue</strong>, <strong>chroma</strong>, and <strong>value</strong>.</p>

<h3>Hue, Chroma, and Value</h3>

<ul>

<li><strong>Hue</strong> is the color family—yellow, red, blue, etc.</li>

<li><strong>Chroma</strong> describes how <strong>pure or gray</strong> a color is.</li>

<li><strong>Value</strong> is the <strong>lightness or darkness</strong> of a color, from white to black.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Value is Key</h3>

<p>While hue and chroma are important, <strong>value</strong> is the most crucial component for creating the illusion of form. Artists often focus on value separately because it plays a key role in depicting light and form.</p>

<h2>Values Create Form and Depth</h2>

<p>Think of a drawing like a building:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Lines</strong> are like the steel beams.</li>

<li><strong>Values</strong> are like the walls filling in the spaces, making it solid.</li>

<li><strong>Textures and colors</strong> are the decorations and details.</li>

</ul>

<p>Values help create the illusion of <strong>form</strong>, <strong>depth</strong>, and <strong>volume</strong>. As a beginner, it's wise to practice drawing without color, focusing on values to understand light and form.</p>

<h2>The Value Scale</h2>

<p>To organize values practically, imagine a scale from <strong>0</strong> (darkest black) to <strong>10</strong> (brightest white).</p>

<h3>Using the Munsell System</h3>

<p>We'll use the <strong>Munsell system</strong>, which measures <strong>light</strong> rather than pigment. A value of 10 means an area is getting the most light, while 0 means it's in complete shadow.</p>

<h3>Simplifying the Value Scale</h3>

<p>In reality, there's an infinite gradation between black and white, but it's impractical to work with infinity. So, we break it down into manageable steps, usually about <strong>10 values</strong>. This simplification makes it easier to communicate and work with values.</p>

<h2>Determining the Values We See</h2>

<p>There are <strong>four factors</strong> that determine the values we see:</p>

<ol>

<li><strong>Light on Form</strong></li>

<li><strong>Local Value</strong></li>

<li>Surface Material</li>

<li>Atmosphere</li>

</ol>

<p>As a beginner, focus on the first two.</p>

<h3>Light on Form</h3>

<p><strong>Light</strong> affects how we perceive the value on an object's surface. Areas facing the light source appear lighter, while planes turning away appear darker.</p>

<h3>Local Value</h3>

<p><strong>Local value</strong> is the inherent lightness or darkness of an object, regardless of lighting. For example, hair is generally darker than skin. An object's local value isn't always consistent; it can vary across its surface.</p>

<h2>Focusing on Values as a Beginner</h2>

<p>Both <strong>light on form</strong> and <strong>local value</strong> work together to create the values we see. By concentrating on these, you'll train your eye to notice subtle shifts in value and translate them into your drawings. Practicing with values before introducing color will have the biggest impact on your art.</p>
