<p>Jake Heller, founder of <strong>Casetext</strong>, transformed his company by leveraging <strong>GPT-4</strong> to create <strong>CoCounsel</strong>, the first successful <strong>vertical AI agent</strong> in the legal industry. In a span of two months, Casetext went from a $100 million valuation to a $650 million acquisition by Thomson Reuters.</p>

<h2>The Origins of Casetext</h2>

<p>Jake Heller started Casetext over a decade ago with the mission to bring the best of technology to the legal field. As a lawyer with a background in computer science, he was frustrated with the outdated technology lawyers had to use.</p>

<h3>Early Challenges</h3>

<p>Initially, Casetext focused on creating an <strong>annotated version of case law</strong>, relying on user-generated content from lawyers. However, they found it difficult to get lawyers to contribute due to their busy schedules and billable hours.</p>

<h3>Pivoting to AI and NLP</h3>

<p>Realizing the limitations, they pivoted to investing deeply in <strong>natural language processing</strong> and <strong>machine learning</strong>. They aimed to automate processes and improve user experiences, but progress was incremental.</p>

<h2>The Turning Point: Discovering GPT-4</h2>

<p>Everything changed when they gained early access to <strong>GPT-4</strong> through their relationship with OpenAI. Jake recalls the first time he saw GPT-4: "We felt like we had this amazing opportunity to run far ahead of the market."</p>

<h3>Shifting the Entire Company</h3>

<p>Within 48 hours, Jake decided to shift all 120 employees to focus entirely on building a new product based on GPT-4. This was a significant risk, but he was convinced that GPT-4 would revolutionize their industry.</p>

<h2>Building CoCounsel with GPT-4</h2>

<p>They conceptualized <strong>CoCounsel</strong> as an <strong>AI legal assistant</strong>, functioning like a new member of a law firm. CoCounsel could handle tasks such as:</p>

<ul>

<li>Reading and analyzing millions of documents</li>

<li>Conducting legal research and writing memos</li>

<li>Summarizing documents and identifying key evidence</li>

</ul>

<h3>Early Customer Reactions</h3>

<p>Under NDA, they allowed a few clients to test CoCounsel. Clients were amazed by its capabilities, with some experiencing an "existential crisis" upon realizing how AI could change their work.</p>

<h2>Overcoming Challenges and Ensuring Accuracy</h2>

<p>One major concern was the <strong>accuracy</strong> of the AI, especially since legal work requires precision.</p>

<h3>Test-Driven Development and Prompt Engineering</h3>

<p>They adopted a <strong>test-driven development</strong> approach, creating thousands of tests for each task CoCounsel performed. They focused on <strong>prompt engineering</strong>, crafting prompts to guide the AI's responses and prevent hallucinations.</p>

<h3>Achieving Near-Perfect Accuracy</h3>

<p>Through rigorous testing and refinement, they achieved near-perfect accuracy, essential for gaining trust from conservative clients in mission-critical applications.</p>

<h2>Leveraging OpenAI's Models</h2>

<p>Jake discussed the impact of OpenAI's <strong>GPT-4</strong> and the newer model referred to as <strong>O(1)</strong>.</p>

<h3>Advancements with O(1)</h3>

<p>O(1) displayed significant improvements in <strong>precision</strong>, <strong>detailed thinking</strong>, and handling complex tasks. They explored new prompting techniques to teach the AI how to think like the best lawyers.</p>

<h2>Advice for Future AI Product Builders</h2>

<p>Jake emphasized that building successful AI products requires more than wrapping a language model.</p>

<h3>Importance of Domain Expertise</h3>

<p>He noted the value of <strong>breaking down tasks</strong> into manageable steps and injecting <strong>domain expertise</strong> into the AI's thought process.</p>

<h3>The Last Mile</h3>

<p>He highlighted that going from 70% to 100% accuracy involves significant effort but adds immense value. Clients are willing to pay more for solutions that work reliably.</p>

<p>Jake Heller's journey illustrates the transformative power of AI when combined with industry expertise and innovative thinking. By embracing GPT-4 and focusing on precision and reliability, Casetext created CoCounsel, revolutionizing legal AI and setting a precedent for future vertical AI agents.</p>
