<h2>What it is</h2>

<p>A new stealth model, <strong>Sonoma Sky Alpha</strong>, appeared on OpenRouter. It offers a <strong>2 million token context window</strong>, the largest among frontier models. For context, Gemini 2.5 Pro and some GPT-4.1 deployments top out at 1 million, and GPT5 is 256k. It performs well on the extended <strong>NYT Connections</strong> benchmark.</p>

<p>I noted strong game-theory results too. In Diplomacy tests it shows the <strong>highest baseline performance</strong> and is <strong>highly steerable</strong>. Out of the box, it handles strategy, negotiation, and anticipating deception very well.</p>

<h2>Performance highlights</h2>

<p>Early tests describe it as <strong>extremely good</strong>, very accurate, efficient with tokens, and fast. Examples include a web app generated in 48 seconds, a DNA sequence analyzer, and a 10 out of 10 experience as a coding tutor. One personal benchmark has it edging GPT5 by <strong>2 to 3 percent</strong>.</p>

<h2>Variants</h2>

<p>There are two versions: <strong>Sonoma Sky Alpha</strong> and <strong>Dusk</strong>. Dusk sounds smaller and faster. The headline is a <strong>2M context window without sacrificing speed or performance</strong>.</p>

<h2>Who likely built it</h2>

<p>Multiple clues point to <strong>XAI’s Grock</strong>. Unicode literacy tests show it can read invisible Unicode as easily as Grock, while models like GPT5 and Opus 4.1 could not even see the prompt. Stylometric analysis across 400 stories per model also makes the match obvious. Hints suggest the next Grock could be <strong>4.2</strong>.</p>

<h2>Compute and training focus</h2>

<p>XAI runs the <strong>Xi Colossus Memphis Phase 2</strong> cluster, about <strong>200,000 H100 equivalents</strong>. Effort appears focused on <strong>reinforcement learning for reasoning</strong>, problem solving, and developing cognitive strategies.</p>

<h2>Grock code fast one</h2>

<p>Also seen as “<strong>Sonic</strong>” in stealth, <strong>Grock code fast one</strong> quickly took a <strong>52.1% coding traffic share</strong> on OpenRouter by Sept 1, 2025. It tests strong despite likely small size, and it is very fast and cheap.</p>

<ul>

<li>Pricing: input <strong>$0.20</strong> per million tokens, output <strong>$1.50</strong> per million. Cheaper than Gemini 2.5 Pro and even 2.5 Flash.</li>

</ul>

<p>I would use it for common coding tasks where <strong>speed, cost, and accuracy</strong> matter, and reserve larger models for the hardest problems.</p>

<h2>Why this matters</h2>

<p>If Sonoma Sky Alpha is Grock’s next step, <strong>4.2</strong> could bring strong reasoning at huge context with speed. Pairing a big reasoner with a fast, low cost coder looks practical and scalable right now.</p>
