<h2>The Importance of Courage</h2>

<p>Over the past year, I've been presented with all kinds of experiences that pushed me to keep saying <strong>yes</strong> to new opportunities. It wasn't easy, and I had to really push myself. Each time I said yes, it felt like a breakthrough. Others would say to me, "I can't believe you did that." I wouldn't have the courage to do that. But I realized that <strong>courage is essential</strong>, otherwise, I'd always be blocking myself from creating the <strong>vibration</strong> I wanted.</p>

<h2>Shifting into a New Vibration</h2>

<p>Over the past ten months, I gradually shifted more and more into this new vibration, and now I feel like I'm truly there in my life. This shift had <strong>massive consequences</strong> for me. It led to my wife and me separating a couple of weeks ago, and now we are in the process of getting a divorce. Even though I'm going through a divorce, I'm feeling good about it. I'm not giving my power to it, it's not disempowering me. I don't feel bad because I know the new vibration I'm shifting into is the right one for me.</p>

<h2>Facing Life Changes with Courage</h2>

<p>In my relationship with my wife, as some friends pointed out, we became so intimate that we were more like <strong>brother and sister</strong>. It was an experience different from what I was truly feeling called to. My heart was calling me in a different direction. As we talked about it, we agreed that the structure of a marriage around our relationship wasn't working for us. We decided to let that go so we could maintain a relationship that was deep and intimate, with friendship being a big part of that, without blocking ourselves from experiencing other things.</p>

<p>Because I was becoming a <strong>vibrational match</strong> for something new, my wife was as well. She's shifting in a new direction herself. By clinging to each other too tightly, by holding ourselves to our comfort zone, we were blocking ourselves from manifesting what we really wanted. We both had to express and exhibit a lot of <strong>courage</strong> to let go of the old and embrace the new.</p>

<h2>Manifesting Abundance Requires Courage</h2>

<p>This is a huge part of manifesting. If you want to manifest what you want in any area of your life, <strong>courage is essential</strong>. You will not get there if you're blocking yourself from doing anything courageous. You have to start embracing the things that come to you from outside your comfort zone. You have to start saying <strong>yes</strong> to them.</p>

<p>My experience is that if you're truly holding that new vibration and you say yes to the opportunities that match it, it always works out. I'm hard-pressed to think of a time when I was holding that new vibration, embraced an opportunity, and it didn't work out. However, when things that match my <strong>old vibration</strong> show up and I say yes to them, that's when things don't work out. That's when I think, "Why did I do that?" It's because I got sucked back into my past.</p>

<p>When I'm a match for the new vibration and I exercise courage to take advantage of the new opportunities, that's when the money keeps flowing, relationships become very deep and intimate very quickly, and I feel happy. There is a congruent play back and forth between the vibration you're putting out and what your reality is sending back to you.</p>

<h2>Living in a State of Abundance</h2>

<p>Living in that state of abundance is a <strong>wonderful place to be</strong>. You will love it, you will absolutely love it. Yes, you will have to go through this courage process again and again to get there. You need to really allow those manifestations to happen, to experience what you want to experience. <strong>Courage is essential</strong>, you must embrace it to allow your manifestations to happen.</p>

<h2>Embracing Fearlessness</h2>

<p>When you are in a state of abundance, you know that there's <strong>nothing to fear</strong>. You know that <strong>fear is an illusion</strong>, and you see through it. If you're feeding your fear, you're giving your power away again, and that's part of the scarcity vibration. The abundance vibration is <strong>fearless</strong> because there is nothing to fear. You know that anything you want to experience in life, you can create it. If you have an experience you don't want to have, you can create something different, you can replace it.</p>

<p>Knowing and holding that power within yourself, knowing that all that power to create is within you, that you are the <strong>creator of your experience</strong>, is part of the abundance mindset. That is a mindset, or I should say a heart set, or a vibration of fearlessness. You want to reach the point where you are relating to your reality no longer on the basis of fear, but on the basis of <strong>I am the creator of this place</strong>. I'm the creator of my experience, and therefore I couldn't possibly have anything to fear because it's all my creation. I'm here to experience and to enjoy it, and to continue to allow my creative energies to flow.</p>
