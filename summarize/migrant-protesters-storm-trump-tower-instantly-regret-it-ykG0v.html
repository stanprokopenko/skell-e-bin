<h2>Arrest of Mahmoud Khalil</h2>

<p><strong>Mahmoud Khalil</strong>, a Columbia University graduate student and legal permanent resident, was <strong>arrested by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE)</strong> last week. Khalil is known for leading protests at Columbia last spring, where students stormed <strong>Hamilton Hall</strong>, causing the campus to be locked down.</p>

<h2>Protests at Trump Tower</h2>

<p>In response to Khalil's arrest, <strong>hundreds of protesters</strong> stormed <strong>Trump Tower</strong> in New York City, demanding his immediate release. The group entered in regular attire, hiding their protest gear underneath. They staged a flash mob sit-in organized by <strong>Jewish Voice for Peace</strong> in the building's atrium.</p>

<h2>Claims of Free Speech Violation</h2>

<p>Protesters argue that Khalil's arrest is a <strong>violation of free speech</strong> and that he is a <strong>political prisoner</strong>. They fear this could be the first of many such arrests, targeting non-citizens who express dissenting views. One protester stated, "It started with Mahmoud, who is a green card holder, and it might continue with me."</p>

<h2>National Security Allegations</h2>

<p>The Trump administration alleges that Khalil is a <strong>supporter of Hamas</strong> and poses a <strong>national security threat</strong>. Reports suggest he has worked for the <strong>United Nations</strong> and the <strong>British government</strong>, and he holds a UK security clearance. Proponents of his arrest argue that non-citizens advocating against the U.S. and its allies may be overstaying their welcome.</p>

<h2>University Response</h2>

<p><strong>Columbia University</strong> announced that some students involved in last spring's protests have been <strong>expelled or suspended</strong>. The university faced significant challenges during the protests, which required assistance from the <strong>NYPD</strong>. Federal agents have also searched the dorm rooms of two students connected to the disturbances.</p>

<h2>Spread of Protests to Other Campuses</h2>

<p>The protests have spread beyond Columbia to other New York City campuses, including the <strong>New School</strong> and <strong>NYU</strong>. Students and even some faculty members have participated in sit-ins and walkouts, revealing deep divisions within the academic community.</p>

<h2>Ongoing Tensions and Future Implications</h2>

<p>Protesters vow to continue their activities, potentially leading to more confrontations. Law enforcement is evaluating how to prevent future incidents, especially after the breach at Trump Tower. The situation raises questions about <strong>freedom of speech</strong>, <strong>immigration policy</strong>, and <strong>national security</strong>. It also highlights the challenges universities face in balancing student activism with campus safety.</p>
