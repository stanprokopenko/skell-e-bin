<h2>Changing My Perspective on AI Agents</h2>

<p>I was skeptical about <strong>AI agents</strong> in the past, but after experimenting with <strong>GPT-4</strong>, I've changed my mind. Previously, my tests failed during planning stages, but this new approach showed promising results.</p>

<h2>Building an Agentic System</h2>

<p>I created a system with multiple agents:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Image Agent</strong>: Generates images based on prompts.</li>

<li><strong>Code Agent</strong>: Writes and executes code using OpenAI's code interpreter.</li>

<li><strong>File Agent</strong>: Reads, writes, and downloads files.</li>

</ul>

<p>These agents work under a <strong>master agent</strong> that plans tasks and delegates them accordingly.</p>

<h2>Testing Complex Instructions</h2>

<p>I gave the system a list of 15 complex instructions involving calculations, style transfers, HTML generation, and image manipulation. The master agent planned each step, and the agents executed them sequentially.</p>

<p>The result was an HTML page displaying images generated per the instructions. The system handled dependencies and context effectively, producing accurate outcomes.</p>

<h2>Adding a Weather Agent</h2>

<p>To expand functionality, I added a <strong>weather agent</strong> using the OpenWeather API. The process was straightforward:</p>

<ol>

<li>Created a new agent similar to the existing ones.</li>

<li>Updated the master agent to include the weather agent.</li>

<li>Tested with instructions involving weather forecasts and image generation.</li>

</ol>

<p>The system successfully retrieved weather data, generated images based on the forecast, and updated the HTML content accordingly.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p>I'm impressed by how well <strong>GPT-4</strong> handles planning and execution in this agentic system. The ability to add new agents and expand capabilities opens up many possibilities.</p>

<p>I was wrong about AI agents before, but this experience has changed my perspective. I'm excited to explore further and see what else we can achieve with this approach.</p>
