<p>I want to share my thoughts on the rapid changes happening in our industry due to AI. We're at a significant reflection point, and it's crucial for us as artists to not be fooled into thinking this is just a passing phase. <strong>AI isn't going away</strong>, and studios are paying close attention.</p>

<h2>The Reality of AI's Impact</h2>

<p>We take pride in our hard work and dedication to improving our skills. But we can't ignore the fact that <strong>AI is transforming the landscape</strong>. Studios are looking at AI as a cost-effective solution, and it's an uphill battle trying to protect jobs from being outsourced or replaced by AI.</p>

<p>Many of us believe that people care deeply about the quality and craftsmanship of our work. However, the reality is that the general audience wants to be entertained, and they don't always notice or care about the nuances we value.</p>

<h2>The First AI Animated Feature Film</h2>

<p>Recently, the first AI feature film - <strong>"Where the Robots Grow,"</strong> was released on YouTube. It was produced for under $700,000, a fraction of what traditional animated films cost. This film was made by a small team using AI tools, and it's an eye-opener.</p>

<p>Kids and parents are watching it without concern for how it was made. They just want to be entertained. This proves that <strong>AI-produced content can and will be accepted</strong> by the masses.</p>

<h2>Adapting to the New Landscape</h2>

<p>So, what does this mean for us? We need to <strong>educate ourselves</strong> about what's happening. Don't bury your head in the sand or dismiss AI outright. <strong>Awareness is key</strong>.</p>

<p>Rather than just voicing our frustrations, we should focus on what we can control. <strong>Collaborate with other artists</strong>, form teams, and create your own content. Start thinking like entrepreneurs. Build your own brand, and consider how you can offer value directly to audiences.</p>

<h2>The Importance of a Business Mindset</h2>

<p>It's essential to develop a <strong>business mindset</strong>. This isn't something we're typically taught, but it's vital now. Learn about marketing, branding, and how to create products that people want. There are opportunities out there beyond traditional studios.</p>

<p>By creating our own content, whether it's through <strong>Kickstarters</strong>, selling at conventions, or online galleries, we can take control of our careers. Original, hand-created art will still hold value, especially as AI-generated content becomes the norm.</p>

<h2>Moving Forward Together</h2>

<p>Let's not waste energy bashing those who use AI or lamenting the changes. Instead, let's <strong>think outside the box</strong> and find ways to thrive. Be proactive, stay informed, and keep honing your craft.</p>

<p>Remember, AI is already a part of our lives in many ways. Embracing reality doesn't mean giving up on our values. It means finding new paths and opportunities.</p>

<h2>Join the Dance</h2>

<p>I'll leave you with a quote that inspired me: <strong>"Life is a party to which you have been invited. Are you going to sit on the sidelines or join in the dance?"</strong> It's up to each of us to decide how we respond to these changes.</p>

<p>Let's join the dance, create our own opportunities, and make amazing art that connects with people. Together, we can navigate this new landscape and continue to do what we love.</p>
