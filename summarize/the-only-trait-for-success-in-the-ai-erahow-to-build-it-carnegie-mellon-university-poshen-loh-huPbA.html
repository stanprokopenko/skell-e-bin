<h2>AI Can Create Too</h2>

<p>I used to say creativity was the one thing AI could not do. I do not say that anymore. AI now generates lots of ideas, and even solved four of the six highly original International Math Olympiad problems last year. The only clearly human thing left is that we care that humans still exist.</p>

<h2>Language Is the Core Skill</h2>

<p>Large language models are powerful because of the L: language. If students use AI to do their writing, they skip the workout that builds thinking. Driving a mile is not exercise. Neither is outsourcing your writing. To think clearly, I need to be fluent in:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Reading, writing, communication, and logic</strong></li>

</ul>

<p>These skills make you mentally fit and able to handle situations you have never seen before.</p>

<h2>How I Test and Teach Thinking</h2>

<p>When I interview students, I keep asking math questions until it is obvious they have never seen the problem. The goal is not to solve it. I give unfamiliar hints and watch how fast they synthesize new ideas. That is creativity. In class, I write a goal on the board, admit I forgot the method, and ask students for ideas. I give feedback on their thinking. We build solutions together.</p>

<h2>Create Value with Empathy</h2>

<p>Soon, humans will not be the most capable entities. We will need to team up. People choose partners who authentically <strong>create value and delight in others</strong>. The key is empathy: see the problem through someone else’s eyes.</p>

<p>I use AI to <strong>simulate the world</strong>, not to write for me. For example, after hearing a great singer in Nashville, I asked AI for links and background to map the logic of how performers get booked. I built my own model of that world. Simulation is the entrepreneur’s superpower.</p>

<h2>Rethink the Goal</h2>

<p>I once chased competition and tests. I later saw brilliant students who were unhappy and lost. A better philosophy: it is addictive to make others happy. As you delight more people, traditional success often follows.</p>

<h2>Scaling Thoughtfulness</h2>

<p>I run live, coach-led online sessions that teach critical thinking. We train kind, mathematically clever high schoolers (15–18) with professional actors and comedians. They learn charisma and communication while coaching 10–13-year-olds in pairs. Actors watch live and give feedback. It builds skills, joy, and a network of kind, clever people who know and trust each other.</p>

<h2>Stay Critical in a Biased World</h2>

<p>Everyone has an <strong>agenda</strong>. I do too: build a more thoughtful world. AI and media are biased, yet convincing. I read across viewpoints daily and ask, “Is that really the whole story?” You need your own reasoning to avoid being misled.</p>

<h2>Social Entrepreneurship That Sustains Itself</h2>

<p>A good social enterprise should make a <strong>net profit per person helped</strong>. Find the real cost of the problem, identify who pays that cost today, and see if they will pay you to solve it. We fund quality classes, then subsidize access for others. Tie impact to real value.</p>

<h2>A Simple Creativity Loop</h2>

<ul>

<li><strong>Generate with excitement</strong>: keep asking, “Is there another way?”</li>

<li><strong>Destroy with rigor</strong>: try to break your idea.</li>

<li>Keep the few diamonds. Then push them.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Why I’m Optimistic</h2>

<p>Thoughtful people stick together. I see kind, capable young people forming strong networks. That gives me hope that we can face big technological challenges with clarity, empathy, and courage.</p>
