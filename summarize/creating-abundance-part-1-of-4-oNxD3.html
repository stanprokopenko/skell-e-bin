<p>Today, I want to talk about <strong>creating abundance</strong> and how to shift away from a <strong>scarcity mentality</strong>. I'll share how to cultivate a reality where you're constantly putting out an abundance vibe, and experiencing it in your life. Instead of feeling like you're lacking the resources to experience what you want, you'll have <strong>absolute, total abundance</strong> flowing through your life, whether it's money, opportunities, friendships, or connections with others.</p>

<h2>The Misconception About Abundance and External Circumstances</h2>

<p>Often, people say to me, "Steve, it's easy for you to experience abundance. You have lots of money flowing through your life, many friends, and plenty of resources and opportunities. Of course, you're going to feel abundant because of all that."</p>

<p>But what do I say to those people? <strong>That's the stupidest thing I've ever heard.</strong> That's exactly the opposite of the truth. Anyone who thinks that way is giving their power away to circumstances. They're projecting their power outside themselves and giving it away to money, relationships, or opportunities, thinking those external things are stronger than they are. <strong>That's a really, really stupid thing to do.</strong> It's precisely a symptom of the scarcity mindset itself.</p>

<h2>The Fallacy of Money Bringing Abundance</h2>

<p>If you're mired in scarcity, you'll think that money will make you feel more abundant. But is that really true? Think about it for a moment. What do you think would happen if suddenly, out of the blue, your finances improved by a factor of ten? Let's say you have ten times as much money in the bank, all your debts are wiped out, and you have ten times as much income. How would you actually feel?</p>

<p>Some people might say they'd feel excited and love it. But really, you'd most likely feel anxious and stressed because you're being taken outside your comfort zone. If you've never had that experience before, it's new, and you're not used to it. You'd be thinking things like, <strong>"What happened? How did I get here? How do I hold on to it? How do I avoid losing all this money? How do I avoid sinking back to where I was?"</strong> You'd be a little nervous and scared.</p>

<p>Even if you got used to it after a while, it's not going to automatically create a feeling of abundance. You could very easily just raise your expenses up to that level and be right where you were. You may find yourself in a situation where your wants begin to pull ahead of your ability to fulfill them. You might just get greedier and greedier, and you're back in your scarcity state again because now you have desires you still can't fulfill. <strong>More money is not going to solve the problem.</strong> That's certainly not what solved the problem for me.</p>

<h2>My Personal Journey from Debt to Abundance</h2>

<p>The truth is, if you want to create an experience of abundance, you can do that no matter where you are financially. It doesn't matter. What worked for me was starting on this path when I was deep in debt. About ten years ago, I was $150,000 in debt. I had a negative cash flow, was about to declare bankruptcy, and was getting kicked out of my apartment because I couldn't pay the rent. I was broke and didn't have any money at the time.</p>

<p>I was very frustrated because I'd been on this path for years and just sinking further into debt. It wasn't working. I was trying to run a business in a way that just wasn't making any money. I got mired in this idea of financial scarcity. There was so much stuff I wanted to experience in life, and it was always like, <strong>"I can't afford it."</strong> It was always outside my ability to bring it to me because of the lack of financial resources. I thought, <strong>"This is really lame to be living this way."</strong></p>

<p>One day, I walked down to the beach, I was living in Marina del Rey, California, at the time, to clear my mind. I sat down on the beach near the Santa Monica Pier, and looked out at the ocean. I thought, <strong>"You know, this is kind of nice."</strong> It's a beautiful place. ** The surf was coming in, the waves were crashing against the seashore, I was sitting on the warm sand, the sun was shining, seagulls were flying overhead, and children were playing further down the beach. People were having fun on the Santa Monica Pier.</p>

<p>I thought, <strong>"This part of reality that I'm experiencing is not so bad. I can come down to the beach anytime and enjoy it. But when I go back and have to deal with my finances, it feels so disempowering."</strong> I wondered, <strong>"Why do I have to let my negative financial situation ruin my entire life?"</strong> There was so much good stuff going on in my life. For example, I was doing a lot of distance running at the time. I thought, <strong>"I can do a 15-mile run. Why don't I feel good about that instead of feeling bad about being $150,000 in debt?"</strong></p>

<p>I started focusing on the good things in my life and what I wanted to experience. It was a way of saying, <strong>"I'm going to stop feeding my power to all this negativity. I'm going to stop feeding my power to all the stuff that's outside my control. I'm going to withdraw the power back into myself and feed it into things I want to experience."</strong></p>

<h2>Shifting Your Focus to Abundance</h2>

<p>I looked out at the ocean and said, <strong>"You know, this is kind of cool."</strong> I get to come to the ocean and enjoy it anytime I want. At least you're free. At least you, Mr. Ocean, don't call me ten times a day saying, 'When can you make a payment?' '<strong> I started thinking, </strong>"Why am I putting so much energy into the crappiest part of my life?" Why am I feeding that so much time, energy, and attention? It's not really helping, it wasn't making it better. </p>

<p>I thought, <strong>"Why don't I just take my energy and simply withdraw it from that and practically ignore all that negative stuff in my life? I'll just focus on all the stuff I want, all the stuff I want to experience."</strong></p>

<p>So I started focusing on what I wanted to experience. I wanted to have an experience of abundance in life. I wanted to experience creativity. I thought, <strong>"What do I really want to do with my time?"</strong> What I really wanted to do was create a cool computer game that people would enjoy. So I focused my time on doing that.</p>

<p>I shifted my energetic frequency that I was putting out in such a way that I was able to succeed on that path. A year later, my financial situation was stable, and several years after that, it was extremely abundant. I learned how to start shifting what I was putting out.</p>

<h2>Understanding the Vibration You're Putting Out</h2>

<p>Now, what do I mean by the <strong>vibration you're putting out</strong>? Many people talk about this thing called the <strong>abundance mindset</strong> or the <strong>scarcity mindset</strong>. I think that's a rather misleading way of describing this phenomenon. That's a term I've used in the past in casual conversations, and I know I've written at least one article where I talked about the abundance mindset. But it's not so much a mindset, because mindset makes you think it's something up here in your mind, like a thought process.</p>

<p>That's part of it, but it's really the least important part. If you get stuck thinking that you have to think about money a certain way and that will create abundance, it's not going to work. You'll just hold yourself back and run yourself in circles for years. Believe me, I've tried that. It doesn't really work.</p>

<p>A better way of thinking about it is in terms of an <strong>abundance heartset</strong>. It's really more of a feeling than a thought. And I'd say an even better way of thinking about it is considering it as the <strong>abundance vibe</strong> that you're putting out.</p>

<h3>The Energetic Signature</h3>

<p>Imagine you're going to a party, and you're meeting some new people you have never met before. At that party, you get a certain feeling from each person you are connecting with. You might meet a woman who is very gregarious, outgoing, and fun-loving. You can tell she's putting out a <strong>fun vibe</strong> right away, and you'd love to connect with her. Over here, there's a guy sitting in the corner by himself, he looks a little shy, a little aloof. You're getting kind of a <strong>disconnected, aloof vibe</strong> from that guy. And over there, there's someone who looks kind of creepy. You think, **"I don't think I want to talk to that person." </p>

<p>You notice some people put out vibes that just <strong>draw you in</strong>, they just <strong>attract you</strong>. Other people put out vibes that <strong>repel you</strong>. The vibe that people are putting out is something you can pick up even at a distance. You pick it up from their body language, you just pick it up from the <strong>energetic signature</strong> that they're putting out.</p>

<p>Now, <strong>you yourself</strong> are also putting out this energetic signature. Your whole being is resonating at a certain frequency. <strong>Abundance is a different frequency of energy that you're putting out than scarcity</strong>, and it's a frequency that you create.</p>

<h2>Retrieving Your Power to Create Abundance</h2>

<p>Anything you do where you're assigning more power to something outside yourself than within yourself, that's part of the <strong>scarcity vibe</strong>. When you withdraw the power into yourself and maintain the power to create what you want to experience, that's an <strong>abundance vibe</strong>. Because now you have the power to manifest or create whatever you want, that is abundance. **Knowing that you can create whatever you want, that's abundance. Feeling like you can't create something you want, that's scarcity. **</p>

<p>So that power must be withdrawn back into you to really have an abundance vibe.</p>
