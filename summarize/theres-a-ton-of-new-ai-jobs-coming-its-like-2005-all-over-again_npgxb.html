<p>As someone who's been in the IT industry since 2006, I've seen my fair share of changes and trends. Recently, I've been inspired by discussions on Reddit and Twitter to share my career story and insights on the emerging AI job market. The parallels between today's AI landscape and the IT boom of the late 90s and early 2000s are striking, and I believe we're on the cusp of a similar revolution in the job market.</p>

<h2>The IT Job Market: Past and Present</h2>

<p>Back in the late 90s and early 2000s, there was a significant shortage of IT professionals. Getting Microsoft certifications almost guaranteed you a job. I remember my mom's boyfriend landing a $50-70k job after getting his Microsoft certifications - a pretty sweet deal at the time.</p>

<p>When I started my IT career in 2006-2007, the job market was quite different from what it is today. Job titles were vague, like "IT analyst," and HR people struggled to describe IT roles accurately. Hiring managers were mainly looking for someone who could fix computers.</p>

<h2>Predictions for the AI Job Market</h2>

<p>Fast forward to today, and I predict we're about to see a <strong>huge shortage of prompt engineering and AI-related jobs</strong>. Based on conversations with industry insiders from various sectors, I believe we'll see significant growth in AI-related jobs over the next 2-5 years.</p>

<p>Young people who are naturally adept at using tools like <strong>ChatGPT and Claude</strong> will have a distinct advantage in this new job market. However, the real value will come from <strong>combining AI skills with other subject matter expertise</strong>.</p>

<p>We're already seeing <strong>high salaries for AI roles</strong> at top companies like Netflix. Over time, this trend will trickle down to lower-level positions. Last year, I was even contacted to provide on-site AI training, which I had to decline due to fatigue and travel constraints.</p>

<h3>Emerging AI Job Roles</h3>

<p>As the AI industry grows, we'll likely see an increase in jobs related to:</p>

<ul>

<li>Prompt engineering</li>

<li>Chatbot development</li>

<li>AI advisors and supervisors</li>

<li>Generative AI team managers</li>

</ul>

<p>Ancillary skills like API integration and AB testing prompts will also be in high demand.</p>

<h2>Skills Needed for AI-Related Jobs</h2>

<p>To succeed in this new AI-driven job market, several key skills will be crucial:</p>

<ol>

<li><strong>Proficiency with AI tools</strong> like ChatGPT and Claude</li>

<li>The ability to <strong>combine AI skills with subject matter expertise</strong></li>

<li><strong>Understanding of low-level AI processes</strong>, even as tools become more user-friendly</li>

<li><strong>Strong communication skills</strong>, especially the ability to talk to executives, managers, and business people on their terms</li>

</ol>

<p>It's important to note that different levels of AI competence exist, from building neural networks to higher-level abstraction. Understanding the epistemics of AI from various perspectives (philosophical, mathematical, etc.) will be valuable in business applications.</p>

<h3>The Importance of Adaptability</h3>

<p>In my experience, the <strong>ability to learn and build mental frameworks</strong> in technology, science, programming, and math is more valuable than specific skills. For example, I learned Pascal and C++ in high school but haven't used them in years. However, understanding lower-level languages like C++ helps appreciate higher-level languages like Python.</p>

<p>The specific skills you learn are often less important than your <strong>ability to learn and adapt</strong>. This has always been true in professional spaces, and it's especially relevant in the rapidly evolving field of AI.</p>

<h2>The Evolution of Technology Jobs and Skills</h2>

<p>Throughout my career, I've witnessed significant changes in how technology jobs are defined and executed. Early on, I worked as a computer desktop installer. Web frameworks used to be developed in-house but are now off-the-shelf products.</p>

<p>Similarly, the work currently being done on agent frameworks and workflows is difficult, but it will become easier in the future. However, knowledge of low-level AI processes will remain valuable even as tools become more user-friendly. Understanding the underlying technology will set you apart in interviews and pitches.</p>

<h2>The Future of AI and Its Impact</h2>

<p>While some predict that AI will quickly lead to AGI and job losses, industry insiders are looking at a 5+ year timeline. In the meantime, we're likely to see more jobs in prompt engineering, chatbot development, and related skills.</p>

<p>The complete replacement of humans with AI is estimated to be 5-10 years away. However, even with advanced AGI, we can expect some friction in AI deployment.</p>

<p>Personally, I'm excited about the potential for AI to accelerate problem-solving in areas like aging, cancer, nuclear fusion, and AGI itself.</p>

<h2>New Era Pathfinders Community</h2>

<p>To help people navigate this new AI-driven job market, I'm launching a community called "New Era Pathfinders." This initiative aims to help people pursue AI careers and navigate the AI era and fourth Industrial Revolution technologies.</p>

<p>We're planning a pre-launch on July 27th, with a public launch on August 5th. If you're interested in staying ahead of the curve in the AI job market, I encourage you to check it out.</p>

<p>In conclusion, the AI job market is poised for explosive growth, much like the IT boom of the late 90s and early 2000s. By developing a combination of AI skills, subject matter expertise, and strong communication abilities, you'll be well-positioned to take advantage of these emerging opportunities. Remember, the key to success in this rapidly evolving field is adaptability and a willingness to learn. Good luck on your AI career journey!</p>
