<h2>Understanding the S Corporation</h2>

<p>An <strong>S corporation</strong> is a tax election that affects how your business income is taxed. You can have an LLC or an Inc. taxed as an S corporation. Using my <strong>trifecta diagram</strong>, we place <strong>operations</strong> on the left, <strong>assets</strong> on the right, and your <strong>trust</strong> or <strong>1040 tax return</strong> at the bottom. The S corporation operates on the business side.</p>

<h2>Strategy 1: Save on Taxes with an S Corporation</h2>

<p>As a <strong>sole proprietor</strong> or an <strong>LLC</strong>, you pay <strong>self-employment tax</strong> (15.3%) on all net income. For instance, earning $100,000 with $25,000 in expenses nets $75,000, resulting in over $11,000 in self-employment tax.</p>

<p>An <strong>S corporation</strong> allows you to <strong>split your income</strong> into a <strong>reasonable salary</strong> and <strong>pass-through income</strong>. You might take a salary of $25,000, with the remaining $50,000 as pass-through income not subject to self-employment tax. This <strong>significantly reduces your tax burden</strong>.</p>

<p>While some worry about the <strong>reasonable salary</strong> requirement, you can determine a fair amount and <strong>avoid IRS issues</strong> with proper guidance.</p>

<h2>Strategy 2: Build Wealth with a Solo 401(k)</h2>

<p>Use your tax savings to <strong>build wealth</strong> by setting up a <strong>solo 401(k)</strong> within your S corporation. You can contribute up to <strong>$30,000</strong> or more, combining employee deferrals and employer matches, reducing taxable income further.</p>

<p>Your investments can <strong>grow tax-deferred</strong>, and you can invest in assets you understand, real estate, crypto, stocks, or mutual funds. Setting up a solo 401(k) is <strong>straightforward</strong> and it is tailored to your business.</p>

<h2>Strategy 3: Unlock More Deductions with a Board of Directors</h2>

<p>Form a <strong>board of directors</strong> including family or close associates. This enables you to:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Deduct travel expenses</strong> for board meetings.</li>

<li>Provide <strong>business-related devices</strong> like cell phones and laptops.</li>

<li><strong>Write off meals</strong> when discussing business.</li>

</ul>

<p>By involving family in your business, you create legitimate, <strong>audit-protected deductions</strong>, increasing profits and funding more wealth.</p>

<p>The <strong>S corporation</strong> offers powerful strategies to <strong>save taxes</strong>, <strong>build wealth</strong>, and <strong>unlock deductions</strong>. By applying these methods, you can exponentially grow your wealth while reducing your tax burden. It's simpler than you might think, and with proper planning, you can reap these benefits and protect your assets.</p>
