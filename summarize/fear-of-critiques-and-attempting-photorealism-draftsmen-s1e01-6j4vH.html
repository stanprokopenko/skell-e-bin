<h2>Critiques Are Your Feedback Loop</h2>

<p>Critiques are part of a <strong>feedback loop</strong>. I do a thing, I make mistakes, I get feedback, I adjust, then I do it again. The loop can come from a teacher or from tools that measure accuracy. That is how I improve in art, sports, or music. It is trial, error, and correction.</p>

<p>Critiques feel scary because they spotlight failure and invite judgment. They can be emotional. A machine telling me I’m off doesn’t sting like a person saying it. Guard against the <strong>fundamental attribution error</strong>. That’s when someone treats a mistake as proof that you are a mistake. Separate the work from the person.</p>

<h2>Objective vs Subjective Feedback</h2>

<p>I sort critiques into two buckets:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Objective</strong>: Anatomy, perspective, proportion, value, temperature. These can be checked. You either hit the target or you didn’t.</li>

<li><strong>Subjective</strong>: Taste and style. “Make it orange instead of blue.” Humor is a good analogy. One audience roars, another sits silent. Same piece, different reactions.</li>

</ul>

<p>First question I ask: <strong>Do I trust the source?</strong> Do they understand my goals, or are they steering my work toward their taste? I prefer mentors who help me get to my vision, not theirs.</p>

<h2>How to Handle Critiques</h2>

<p>Here are the patterns I see:</p>

<ul>

<li>Too fearful to hear negatives. Growth stalls.</li>

<li>Invites critique, takes notes, applies it. Trajectory skyrockets.</li>

<li>Consumes everyone’s feedback. Gets pulled in all directions and loses vision.</li>

<li>Rejects all feedback. Sometimes works if the vision is strong and right, but it is risky.</li>

</ul>

<p>The ideal is a balance. Think of an <strong>umbrella</strong>. Too open and it collapses. Too closed and it is useless. I stay open to ideas that clearly move me toward my goal and closed to ones that don’t fit.</p>

<p>Beginners should lean more open. Don’t hide behind “it’s my style” to dodge fundamentals. Use a <strong>small, trustworthy community</strong>. An atelier-like group with a shared direction gives variety without chaos. Group dialogue also reveals what is missing in the training and helps everyone find resources faster.</p>

<h2>Why Train in Photorealism and Representational Work</h2>

<p>I don’t believe photorealism is the best art, but it is a great <strong>way to study nature</strong>. A representational goal gives clear rules. If it is off, it is off. That objectivity builds your eye and your toolbox.</p>

<p>What you learn:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Light on form</strong> and <strong>color theory</strong></li>

<li><strong>Value control</strong> and <strong>temperature sensitivity</strong></li>

<li><strong>Material handling</strong> across media. Copy a photo in pencil, watercolor, or stipple. You get immediate, measurable feedback.</li>

</ul>

<p>Use family and photos as references. Early on, I drew from photos until I had access to live models. Representational training makes the feedback loop <strong>objective</strong>. Later, you can bend or break rules with intention.</p>

<h2>Developing Style</h2>

<p>To grow your style, <strong>copy stylistic masters</strong> you love. Treat them as artistic parents. Do homages. Switch styles based on the project. I do this even as a pro. It is a fast way to expand your range without aimless experimentation. Just don’t make copying your whole career. Use it to absorb principles, then synthesize your own voice.</p>

<h2>Takeaways</h2>

<ul>

<li>Embrace critiques as a feedback loop.</li>

<li>Separate objective corrections from subjective opinions.</li>

<li>Choose mentors who share your vision and won’t yank your work toward theirs.</li>

<li>Balance openness and conviction.</li>

<li>Train representationally to learn the science of seeing.</li>

<li>Copy masters to build style, then make it your own.</li>
