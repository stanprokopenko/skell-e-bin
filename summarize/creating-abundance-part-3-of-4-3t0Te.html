<h2>The Importance of Vibration and Feeling</h2>

<p>Many people come to me saying they're trying to apply the law of attraction, they're doing affirmations, reading their goals each day, but they can't seem to manifest anything. They begin to doubt if the law of attraction is even true.</p>

<p>I look at them and ask, "What are you trying to manifest?" They often reply, "I'm trying to manifest a life of passion, excitement, and total abundance. I want all that in my life." Yet, the vibe they're exuding is the exact opposite. They seem disconnected, bored, or apathetic. That's not what abundance feels like. <strong>Where's the feeling?</strong></p>

<p>If the feeling isn't there, it's not going to manifest. The vibration must be put out by that person.</p>

<h2>Methods to Create the Desired Feeling</h2>

<p>It's not just about reading affirmations. For the most part, I think reading affirmations is a waste of time, unless it genuinely helps you create that feeling. If reading affirmations in a passionate state gets you worked up and generates that emotion, then by all means, use it.</p>

<p>Visualization exercises can also help create that feeling. Shifting physiology, standing or breathing a certain way, works for some, but I find it limiting. I don't necessarily associate a specific body language with feeling abundant. In my experience, body language is more of an effect, not a cause.</p>

<p>I find it's easier to focus on thoughts. Sitting in your car thinking about abundance can give rise to the feeling. If changing your body language works for you, like standing a certain way several times a day, then use it. The real idea here is to do whatever it takes to create that <strong>vibration</strong> and make it a dominant part of your daily reality.</p>

<h2>Changes in Reality When Shifting Vibration</h2>

<p>Once you start embodying this new vibration and it becomes more dominant, things in your external reality will begin to change. They'll change in two primary ways initially:</p>

<ol>

<li>

<p><strong>Disconnect with Non-Resonant Elements</strong>: You'll start feeling more disconnected from aspects of your reality that don't resonate with your new vibration. If you're trying to create an experience of abundance, anything that keeps knocking you back into scarcity will frustrate you. Certain people in your life may no longer align with you.</p>

</li>

<li>

<p><strong>Emergence of New Opportunities</strong>: New opportunities, people, and experiences will start showing up that are congruent with your new vibration. For instance, if you're focusing on financial abundance, a new business opportunity may appear. In your old scarcity mindset, you would never have noticed or capitalized on it. Now, it matches your new state of abundance.</p>

</li>

</ol>

<h2>The Need for Courage</h2>

<p>Here's the tricky part, and you may not want to hear it, but I assure you it's true: creating the new vibration is not enough. If that's all you do, you won't get there. The second key element is that you need to exercise <strong>courage</strong>.</p>

<p>To fully shift your reality, not just your internal vibration, you have to take courageous action. There's no way to transition into the new reality without doing something brave, without facing some fear, maybe a lot, depending on how big a shift you're trying to make.</p>

<p>Disconnecting from old relationships and things you're attached to in your old reality will take courage. Embracing the new opportunities that come to you also requires courage.</p>

<h2>Stepping Outside Your Comfort Zone</h2>

<p>Think of it like this, you're in a certain comfort zone right now. You've been experiencing certain relationships, a certain career, a certain financial situation, it's familiar and comfortable, even if it's not what you want.</p>

<p>Shifting to a new state of being, a new vibration, is outside your comfort zone. <strong>You won't be comfortable with it.</strong> When new things start showing up in your life, they'll give you a feeling of discomfort, which you may interpret as fear. You might be scared to take advantage of these opportunities.</p>

<p>When I was shifting my foundation financially, new business deals would show up that were bigger than anything I'd done before. They made me a little nervous. If I let that nervousness shift me back into scarcity, I'd block the abundance. So I had to stay in the abundance mindset, which includes confidence. I had to exercise courage to take advantage of those deals.</p>

<p>On the flip side, I had to be courageous enough to disconnect from things in my life that didn't resonate with my new vibration of abundance. You do have to take action here. That's where the action comes in, being able to summon the courage to follow your heart. When you've created this new vibration, you've got to <strong>honor it</strong>.</p>

<h2>Embracing Change and Taking Action</h2>

<p>If you keep reverting to the old vibration, you'll block what manifests. The manifestations will start showing up, but they'll come in a way that makes you uncomfortable. That's when you have to say, "Alright, I know courage is required. I just have to be brave and do it. I've got to let go of the old and start embracing the new."</p>

<p>For example, this year I decided to focus on creating intimacy abundance in my life. For most of my adult life, I'd had a deep, intimate connection with just one woman, the intimacy part of my life was this one marriage, one relationship. As I thought more about the abundance mindset, this no longer felt like a good fit.</p>

<p>I felt like I was trying to get all my experience of love from just one person, and that didn't resonate with me anymore. I began shifting into a vibration of wanting to be surrounded by a radiant field of love, having deep, loving, intimate connections with multiple people. Maybe not a huge number, but at least half a dozen really close, intimate friends. We could talk about anything, care deeply about each other, and inspire one another.</p>

<p>I imagined what it would feel like to have multiple emotionally intimate connections, with the possibility of multiple physically intimate connections as well. As I envisioned it, it felt so good, better than what I was experiencing. I kept thinking about it and how good it felt. I started shifting into that vibration.</p>

<h2>Allowing Reality to Align with Your New Vibration</h2>

<p>As the new experiences started coming to me, I initially blocked them. I'd think, "Wait a minute, I can't do that, I'm married." But I kept focusing on that right vibration, so these things kept showing up. Eventually, I realized what I was doing. I wanted to step into this vibration, allowing my reality to be congruent with the person I was becoming on the inside.</p>

<p>That took a lot of courage. I had to start doing things that were very much outside my comfort zone, things I hadn't experienced before. But I knew I needed to exercise that courage, to fully embrace the new vibration and let my reality shift accordingly.</p>
