<p>Welcome to Proko! I'm Stan Prokopenko, and today we're diving into a crucial topic for artists: the basic elements that make up any picture. As artists, we're constantly trying to represent our 3D world on a 2D surface. To create the illusion of depth, we need to understand four key elements: Shape, Edge, Value, and Color. Think of these as the periodic table for artists - but luckily, it's a much smaller table!</p>

<h2>The Four Basic Elements</h2>

<p>These elements are the building blocks of any visual representation, whether it's a realistic portrait, an abstract painting, or a photograph. Let's break them down:</p>

<ol>

<li>Shape</li>

<li>Edge</li>

<li>Value</li>

<li>Color</li>

</ol>

<p>While you could argue that there are only three major elements (Shape, Edge, and Color), with Value being a sub-element of Color, we often separate Value because of its crucial role in drawing, especially when working in black and white.</p>

<h2>Shape: The Foundation of Your Art</h2>

<p>Shape is the most fundamental element we use to draw. It's the area that something takes up - the outline or contour of all the pieces in your drawing. But it's not just about the big elements; smaller parts have specific shapes too.</p>

<p><strong>Key points about Shape:</strong></p>

<ul>

<li>Simplify shapes in the early stages of drawing</li>

<li>Focus on composition and big picture breakdown</li>

<li>Think in terms of geometric shapes (circles, squares, triangles, etc.)</li>

<li>Work from big to small</li>

<li>Shape is crucial for conveying the identity of an object</li>

</ul>

<p><strong>Shape design</strong> is an essential skill to develop. It's about making your shapes look good and interesting while effectively conveying your subject.</p>

<h2>Color: The Vibrant Element</h2>

<p>Color is a complex topic that deserves its own deep dive, but let's cover the basics. Color has three sub-categories:</p>

<ol>

<li><strong>Hue</strong>: What we typically refer to as "color" (red, blue, yellow, etc.)</li>

<li><strong>Chroma</strong>: How grey or pure the color is</li>

<li><strong>Value</strong>: How light or dark the color is</li>

</ol>

<h3>Hue</h3>

<ul>

<li>Represented in the traditional color wheel</li>

<li>Can be divided into warm and cool families</li>

</ul>

<h3>Chroma</h3>

<ul>

<li>Ranges from pure colors to grey</li>

<li>Can be "neutralized" by adding grey or its complement</li>

</ul>

<h3>Value</h3>

<ul>

<li>Often considered separately due to its importance</li>

<li>Typically thought of on a scale from 0 to 10</li>

<li>Crucial for showing form and depth</li>

</ul>

<p>As a beginner, it's wise to practice drawing without color (just using value) to focus on form and depth. Once you're comfortable with values, you can introduce color to add emotional impact and catch the viewer's eye.</p>

<h2>Edge: The Transition Between Shapes</h2>

<p>Edge refers to the transition between two shapes. It doesn't have to be the edge of a volume; shapes within a volume have edges too. There are four main types of edges:</p>

<ol>

<li><strong>Sharp</strong>: A sudden transition between shapes</li>

<li><strong>Firm</strong>: Almost hard, but with a very small gradation</li>

<li><strong>Soft</strong>: A smooth transition between shapes</li>

<li><strong>Lost</strong>: So soft that it becomes invisible</li>

</ol>

<p>Edges are crucial for creating form and depth in your drawings and paintings.</p>

<h2>Putting It All Together</h2>

<p>When you're drawing or painting, you need to develop an intuitive checklist to identify these elements in your subject:</p>

<ul>

<li>What's the shape?</li>

<li>What's the color (value, hue, and chroma)?</li>

<li>What's the edge?</li>

</ul>

<p>Let's practice with an example of a clementine:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Shape</strong>: Simplified, it's a crescent for the shadow</li>

<li><strong>Value</strong>: The shadow is the darkest part, so it might be a 0 on a 0-10 scale</li>

<li><strong>Hue</strong>: Transitions from orange in the light to redder in the shadow</li>

<li><strong>Chroma</strong>: Somewhere in the middle, leaning towards high chroma</li>

<li><strong>Edge</strong>: Firm on the left, softer on the right</li>

</ul>

<p>Developing the ability to see and identify these elements is a skill that requires practice. Just like a musician trains their ear, you need to train your eye to see these subtleties and view the world as an artist.</p>

<p>Remember, it's all about repetition and practice. Keep at it, and you'll develop that artist's eye in no time!</p>
