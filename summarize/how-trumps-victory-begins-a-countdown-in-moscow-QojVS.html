<h2>Trump's Victory and Its Impact</h2>

<p>Trump has won a second term, and the <strong>Democrats' blue wall crumbled again</strong>. This outcome has major implications for the <strong>war in Ukraine</strong>. While many in the U.S. debate why the Harris campaign failed, the rest of the world is focused on how this changes the strategic landscape.</p>

<h2>Russia's Accelerated Offensive</h2>

<p>Since <strong>November 2023</strong>, I've noticed that Russia has <strong>intensified its offensive</strong> in Ukraine. The pace has increased dramatically, with <strong>539 square kilometers</strong> gained in October alone. However, <strong>Russian casualties and equipment losses</strong> have also spiked. They're pushing harder, accepting higher losses to gain more ground.</p>

<h2>Anticipating a Trump-Imposed Peace</h2>

<p>I believe Russia's escalation is due to anticipating a <strong>Trump-imposed peace plan</strong>. Trump has expressed a desire to end the war, potentially by freezing the front lines and cutting aid to Ukraine if they refuse a settlement. Knowing this, Russia wants to <strong>capture as much territory as possible</strong> before any peace deal locks in the status quo.</p>

<h2>The Challenge of November Weather</h2>

<p>Complicating matters, <strong>November brings rain and mud</strong> to Ukraine, making advances difficult. The infamous <strong>rasputitsa</strong> turns battlefields into bogs. Russia hoped to reach key objectives like <strong>Pokrovsk</strong> before the weather turned, aiming for winter sieges rather than muddy maneuvers.</p>

<h2>What's Next?</h2>

<p>With Trump's victory certain, it feels like <strong>now or never</strong> for Russia. They might accelerate their efforts despite the weather. Conversely, if Harris had won, Russia might have pulled back, adjusting to a longer war without the urgency.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p>Russia faces a <strong>race against time</strong>, battling both the approaching winter and the geopolitical shifts from the U.S. election. The next few months will be critical in determining the course of the war in Ukraine.</p>
