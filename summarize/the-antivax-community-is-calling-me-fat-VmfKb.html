<h2>My Experience on Jubilee</h2>

<p>Recently, I appeared on a Jubilee episode debating vaccines. The response was unusual, I received some of the strangest comments I've ever gotten. Many focused on my appearance, particularly my <strong>weight gain</strong> and <strong>posture</strong>.</p>

<h2>Empathy in Conversations</h2>

<p>During the debate, I aimed to be <strong>empathetic</strong> and listen carefully. The participants had diverse beliefs, and I appreciated that they were polite and allowed me to speak. I wanted to ensure I provided <strong>accurate information</strong> and acknowledged past mistakes in the medical community.</p>

<h2>Handling Negative Comments</h2>

<p>After the episode aired, I noticed a shift from critiques about being a "pharma shill" to comments about my <strong>weight</strong> and <strong>posture</strong>. People called me <strong>fat</strong>, made jokes, and <strong>body shamed</strong> me. Some even questioned my credibility based on my appearance.</p>

<h2>The Harm of Body Shaming</h2>

<p>I'm aware that I've <strong>gained weight</strong>, and that my <strong>posture</strong> isn't perfect. But <strong>body shaming</strong> is unhelpful, and harmful. It doesn't motivate people to be healthier, it just spreads negativity. We should stop body shaming, and focus on <strong>respectful communication</strong>.</p>

<h2>Respectful Communication Matters</h2>

<p>I saw many unkind comments toward the participants, calling them <strong>stupid</strong> or <strong>misinformed</strong>. Disrespectful comments don't help anyone understand each other better. It's important to approach conversations with <strong>empathy</strong> and listen to different perspectives.</p>
