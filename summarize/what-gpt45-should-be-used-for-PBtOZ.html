<p>I've been exploring OpenAI's <strong>GPT 4.5</strong>, which was recently released with some fanfare. It's not just another upgrade, this model focuses on <strong>creativity and emotional intelligence</strong>. While it doesn't outperform reasoning models on traditional benchmarks, there is something intriguing about it.</p>

<h2>What's New in GPT 4.5</h2>

<p>GPT 4.5 is the largest model OpenAI has ever produced. However, it's not labeled a <strong>Frontier Model</strong> because it doesn't introduce net new capabilities or surpass models like O1, O3 Mini, and Deep Research on most evaluations. Instead, it's at the forefront of what's possible in <strong>unsupervised learning with ultra-large datasets</strong>.</p>

<p>Unlike GPT 4, this model doesn't have <strong>voice mode</strong> and isn't a full replacement. It's designed to feel more natural in interactions, with a broader knowledge base and improved ability to follow user intent.</p>

<h2>Focus on Creativity and Emotional Intelligence</h2>

<p>OpenAI emphasizes GPT 4.5's enhanced <strong>EQ</strong>. In their announcement, they highlight how interacting with it feels more natural. For example, when someone says they're going through a tough time after failing a test, GPT 4 responds with a standard list of suggestions. GPT 4.5, however, replies:</p>

<p><em>"Oh, I'm really sorry to hear that. Failing a test can be pretty tough and discouraging. But remember, it's just one moment, not a reflection of who you are or your capabilities. Want to talk about what happened or do you just need a distraction? I'm here either way."</em></p>

<p>This response feels more <strong>human</strong> and <strong>empathetic</strong>.</p>

<h2>User Reactions</h2>

<p>Many are noticing that GPT 4.5 excels at <strong>creative writing</strong>. One user compared stories generated by GPT 4 and GPT 4.5 from the same prompt. GPT 4's story was generic, while GPT 4.5 produced a vivid and original tale.</p>

<p>Some describe the difference between GPT 4 and GPT 4.5 as the gap between an extremely knowledgeable 20-year-old and an extremely knowledgeable 40-year-old. There's a depth and richness in GPT 4.5's outputs that wasn't there before.</p>

<h2>Challenges with Cost</h2>

<p>Despite its capabilities, GPT 4.5 is <strong>expensive</strong> and compute-intensive. OpenAI's CEO mentioned they're running out of GPUs and are working to add more. There's uncertainty about whether they'll continue supporting it in the API long-term due to its cost.</p>

<p>Some users express concern over the high pricing, noting that it's significantly more expensive than other models. This raises questions about its practical applications and accessibility.</p>

<h2>My Takeaway</h2>

<p>As an instructor, I'm fascinated by GPT 4.5's advancements in creativity and emotional intelligence. While it may not be the go-to model for reasoning tasks, its ability to produce <strong>human-like</strong> and emotionally resonant responses opens up new possibilities. Whether it's helping someone through a tough time or crafting compelling narratives, GPT 4.5 brings a new dimension to AI interactions.</p>
