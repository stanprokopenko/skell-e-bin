<p>A debate on AI and intellectual property (<strong>IP</strong>) led me to question our current IP system. Unique Neosaurus's critiques of IP's flaws intensified my thoughts on its necessity.</p>

<h2>Patent Abuse</h2>

<p>While <strong>patents</strong> protect inventors, they can be abused. Pharmaceutical companies inflate <strong>insulin</strong> prices by filing excessive patents, hindering competition. Insulin costs about <strong>$99</strong> per vial in the U.S., but only <strong>$12</strong> in Canada and <strong>$2.50</strong> in Turkey. This suggests issues beyond IP, emphasizing the role of <strong>government regulation</strong>.</p>

<h2>Crowdfunding as an Alternative</h2>

<p>Unique Neosaurus proposes funding creative works via <strong>crowdfunding</strong> platforms like Kickstarter, reducing reliance on IP. We'd invest in projects we support, relying on creators' <strong>reputation</strong>.</p>

<p>However, this model has risks. Crowdfunding can lead to under-delivery or fraud. Consumers must thoroughly research creators to invest wisely.</p>

<h2>Challenges Without IP</h2>

<p>A <strong>zero-IP world</strong> might flood us with countless similar works, causing <strong>choice paralysis</strong>. Determining the <strong>canonical</strong> version of a story could become chaotic. While originality varies, eliminating IP might dilute genuine creativity with trivial variations.</p>

<h2>The Role of Copyright</h2>

<p>Despite its flaws, <strong>copyright</strong> deters plagiarism. Without it, larger entities could exploit smaller creators without legal repercussions. Ethical standards alone may not prevent plagiarism, especially if undetected or ignored by powerful companies.</p>

<h2>AI and IP</h2>

<p>The rise of <strong>AI</strong> complicates the IP debate. Ironically, I was more open to dismantling IP before AI's emergence. <strong>Copyright lawsuits</strong> are among the few tools against AI companies misusing creative works. AI can disrupt industries and invade privacy, often prioritizing corporate interests.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p>IP and AI can both be abused by those in power. Should we abolish IP entirely? I'm undecided. Though flawed, IP provides protections that may be crucial, especially with AI's rapid advancement.</p>
