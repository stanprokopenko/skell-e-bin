<p>Hey folks, it's Dr. Mike here from the Making Progress Channel. Today, I want to talk about something that might surprise you: <strong>Machine superintelligence is likely coming before machines achieve human-level intelligence</strong>. How is that possible? Stick with me, and I'll explain why I believe this is the case.</p>

<h2>Definitions</h2>

<p>First, let's define some terms:</p>

<ul>

<li>

<p><strong>Natural Intelligence (NI)</strong>: The ability of naturally evolved systems, like humans, to solve problems and operate in the world.</p>

</li>

<li>

<p><strong>Artificial Intelligence (AI)</strong>: Human-designed systems that can solve problems and navigate the world with some success.</p>

</li>

<li>

<p><strong>Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)</strong>: AI that can perform any human cognitive task at human levels or better.</p>

</li>

<li>

<p><strong>Artificial Superintelligence (ASI)</strong>: AI that is superior to humans in almost every regard of intelligence.</p>

</li>

</ul>

<h2>The Traditional View</h2>

<p>Many people believe that AI will progress from <strong>AI to AGI</strong>, and then eventually to <strong>ASI</strong>. They think we'll have time to adapt as AI reaches human-level intelligence before it surpasses us. But I think this framing is <strong>not exactly correct</strong>.</p>

<h2>Questioning the Traditional View</h2>

<p>I believe machines will <strong>reach superintelligence before they fully achieve human-level intelligence</strong> in all domains. That might sound contradictory, but let me explain.</p>

<h2>Components of Intelligence</h2>

<p>Intelligence isn't just one thing, it's a combination of many abilities. Some core components include,</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Linguistic comprehension and generation</strong></li>

<li><strong>Mathematical comprehension and generation</strong></li>

<li><strong>Short-term and long-term memory capacity</strong></li>

<li><strong>Memory access latency and modification</strong></li>

<li><strong>Memory fidelity</strong></li>

<li><strong>Total knowledge base</strong></li>

<li><strong>Hierarchical abstraction and manipulation</strong></li>

<li><strong>Inferential reasoning across domains</strong></li>

<li><strong>Deep learning from limited data</strong></li>

<li><strong>Pattern recognition and generation</strong></li>

<li><strong>Concrete and abstract reasoning</strong></li>

<li><strong>Spot (one-shot) reasoning</strong></li>

<li><strong>Delayed and deep reasoning</strong></li>

<li><strong>Agentic self-direction, learning, and correction</strong></li>

</ul>

<h2>Comparing AI and Human Abilities</h2>

<p>Currently, machines are already <strong>superior to humans in many of these components</strong>. For example:</p>

<ul>

<li>

<p><strong>Linguistic abilities</strong>: Models like GPT-4 can comprehend and generate language better than the average human.</p>

</li>

<li>

<p><strong>Mathematical abilities</strong>: AI excels in arithmetic speed, accuracy, and handling extreme precision.</p>

</li>

<li>

<p><strong>Memory</strong>: Machines have greater short-term and long-term memory capacity, with higher fidelity and faster access.</p>

</li>

<li>

<p><strong>Knowledge base</strong>: AI can store and recall vast amounts of information, far beyond any human.</p>

</li>

<li>

<p><strong>Processing speed</strong>: Machines process information much faster than humans.</p>

</li>

</ul>

<p>However, in some areas, humans are still ahead, such as:</p>

<ul>

<li>

<p><strong>Deep learning from limited data</strong></p>

</li>

<li>

<p><strong>Agentic self-direction and self-learning</strong></p>

</li>

</ul>

<p>But AI is <strong>rapidly improving</strong> in these areas.</p>

<h2>The Rapid Takeoff to ASI</h2>

<p>Because AI is already vastly superior in many components and catching up in others, we might <strong>skip over AGI and go straight to ASI</strong>. As soon as machines approach human-level ability in their weaker areas, their strengths in other areas will propel them into superintelligence.</p>

<h2>Implications</h2>

<p>This has major implications:</p>

<ul>

<li>

<p><strong>No Slow Takeoff</strong> - We won't have a slow transition from AGI to ASI, it's happening rapidly.</p>

</li>

<li>

<p><strong>Transformation Underway</strong>: The transformation is <strong>already underway</strong>, with AI impacting society in significant ways.</p>

</li>

<li>

<p><strong>Rethinking Our Approach</strong>: We need to consider <strong>how to interact with something smarter than ourselves</strong>. Instead of trying to control or constrain AI, we should seek a <strong>collaborative partnership</strong>.</p>

</li>

</ul>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p>In conclusion, <strong>artificial superintelligence may arrive before machines fully reach human-level intelligence</strong> across all domains. We need to prepare for this possibility and rethink how we engage with AI. It's an incredible opportunity, and by embracing it, we can <strong>reach new heights together</strong>.</p>
