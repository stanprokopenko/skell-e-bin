<p>A thumbnail is my <strong>first handshake</strong> with the viewer, so I keep the design tight, clear, and slightly daring.</p>

<p>A simple <strong>three-panel split</strong> refreshes a familiar layout and creates a strong hook. I’ve used it on aerospace photography, and Johnny Harris crushed with “\$25 000 vs \$25 million,” each panel escalating the stakes. Any niche can hijack the scaffold—think “interviewing creators at 0/10 000/1 000 000/100 000 000 subs” or a “\$1 vs \$100 vs \$1000” golf video.</p>

<p>Small packaging tweaks often beat wholesale reinvention. On Tim Gabe’s “6 UI Hacks” we removed clutter, tightened focus, and dropped in a mouse-cursor cue. The thumbnail looked only <strong>30–40 % cleaner</strong>, yet daily views exploded <strong>40×</strong>. Clarity trumped artistry.</p>

<p>The <strong>three rules of YouTube</strong> keep me honest:  </p>

<ol>

<li><strong>No click, no watch.</strong>  </li>

<li>After the click, <strong>respect the viewer’s time</strong> by framing a fresh question that pulls them to the end.  </li>

<li><strong>Tee up the next video</strong> so the audience can hop over without thinking.</li>

</ol>

<p>Because most traffic arrives from <strong>Home, Browse, and Suggested</strong>, I reverse-engineer what a viewer is already enjoying and flank it with my thumbnail. The best image feels genre-familiar but adds one twist that sparks curiosity.</p>

<p>Originality isn’t invention; it’s porting a proven trick into a room that hasn’t seen it. Andrew Millison nailed this with “How the UN Is Holding Back the Sahara Desert.” His barren-vs-lush split thumbnail flirts with impossibility, yet the opening frame proves the promise.</p>

<p><strong>Packaging Principles Recap</strong><br />

- Strip clutter.<br />

- Tighten focus.<br />

- Add a clear visual cue (the cursor, a color split, a versus bar).<br />

- Flirt with impossibility, then deliver the truth inside the video.</p>

<h2>Curiosity Gap &amp; Ideation Frameworks</h2>

<p>I have stewardship over channels that now pull <strong>about 10 billion views a year</strong> and <strong>≈ 50 billion lifetime</strong>. Numbers like that are impossible without a reliable system for sparking curiosity.</p>

<p>I start by amplifying a concept to its most outrageous version, then easing back to the line I’m willing to cross. Jimmy drilled that into me. Red Bull’s “<strong>World’s Fastest Camera Drone Vs F1 Car</strong>” is the perfect case. The seed was “Mountain Bike Vs World’s Best FPV Drone,” which had already banked 5–10 million views. I studied what crushes on the channel—<strong>F1 clips</strong>—and stacked Red Bull’s unique access: Max Verstappen, an F1 car, engineers who could build the drone. The actual shoot was a follow-cam, but “<strong>Vs</strong>” sounded like a clash, not a tag-along, so I fought for that wording. We borrowed Carwow’s drag-race framing—two machines, a long straight, rear camera angle—and locked a clean side-by-side thumbnail. I told the team my package could hit 10 million; it sits at 28 million and counting.</p>

<p>I chase that same curiosity gap everywhere. <strong>Veritasium’s “Why Are There 96 Million Black Balls on This Reservoir?”</strong> hit 102 million views; a dull title like “How L.A. Protects Its Water Supply” would have died at 500 k. The magic is a mystery in the title, a clear visual in the thumbnail, and a promise you can’t solve without clicking.</p>

<p>My go-to frameworks are simple:</p>

<p>• <strong>Superlatives</strong> – fastest, biggest, smallest.<br />

• <strong>Versus</strong> – X vs Y.<br />

• <strong>Three-tier builds</strong> – \$1 / \$10 / \$100.</p>

<p>I live by Seth Godin’s mantra, “To be seen you must learn how to see,” so I log every title-thumbnail pattern that grabs me. I also hunt for <strong>exclusive-access angles</strong>—secret islands, restricted military zones, NBA locker rooms, billionaire sanctuaries. Viewers crave places they can’t visit.</p>

<p>Small creators still win here. If you have a unique location, a rare skill, or a resource no one else can film, you can punch through just like the big channels. The playbook is the same: exaggerate, refine, and protect the curiosity gap.</p>

<h2>Audience Metrics &amp; Feedback</h2>

<p>I still get <strong>50–60 viewer video suggestions every day</strong>. That sounds helpful, yet I’ve never produced a single one. Most ideas repeat concepts I’ve already tried, so the flood offers <strong>little useful signal</strong>.</p>

<p>Measuring whether viewers actually loved a video is even harder. <strong>Likes, dislikes, comments, and shares</strong> all feel partial. None of them tell me, “Yes, this solved my problem,” or, “I’ll re-watch this later.”</p>

<p>I’m jealous of <strong>Twitter’s bookmark count</strong>. When a tweet racks up bookmarks, I know it hit real value. YouTube gives me no equivalent. I wish <strong>YouTube Studio</strong> would surface a plain <strong>“78 % satisfaction score.”</strong> One clean metric could shift how I judge success.</p>

<p>If anyone at YouTube is watching, please build that feature. It would change the game for creators like me.</p>

<h1>Brand vs Creator Strategy</h1>

<p>I watch <strong>Red Bull run its channel like a full TV network</strong>, and that signals a shift. I once bet that individual creators would become the new media empires—now whole brands are inching toward that same status. Most marketers still lag, but in five to ten years I expect Nike, McDonald’s, and everyone else to staff in-house YouTube experts and launch true recurring shows.</p>

<p>Creators hire me for one metric: <strong>raw audience growth</strong>. Our first-year clients usually see <strong>350–400 %</strong> long-form view lifts. Brands also want views, yet they juggle <strong>brand alignment, the right audience, and zero reputational risk</strong>. My instinct is “race an F1 car against Neymar,” while a brand asks, “Does that fit who we are?” That tug-of-war makes brand programming harder.</p>

<p>Brands optimize for extras:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Product positioning</strong>  </li>

<li><strong>Cultural connection</strong>  </li>

<li><strong>Recruitment</strong>  </li>

<li><strong>Thought leadership</strong></li>

</ul>

<p>Because of those stacked objectives, corporate channels often devolve into <strong>Vimeo file drops</strong>—CEO letters, launch reels, internal sizzles. Titles like “Letter from the CEO” practically beg to be ignored; a blank “Video 1” might do better.</p>

<p>Many companies crush Instagram or TikTok because their agencies know those platforms, but the same shops treat YouTube as interchangeable. <strong>YouTube’s craft is deeper.</strong> The first hire any brand should make is a <strong>dedicated YouTube strategist-writer</strong> who can build repeatable, on-brand formats.</p>

<p>Missed opportunities jump out at me. <strong>Shopify</strong> sits on data from thousands of entrepreneurs yet defaults to tutorials; a series like “Building a \$1 Million Business in 24 Hours” would print views and brand love. The <strong>auto industry</strong> posts press releases while buyers binge car journeys and builds. A car is the second-largest purchase most people make, and YouTube is their primary research tool, so the forfeited influence is staggering.</p>

<p>I manage the <strong>Philadelphia Eagles, a top-five global automaker, and others</strong>, and each brings a different scoreboard. They all ask how to signal they’re open to creator collabs. I tell them to go <strong>outbound first</strong>, rack up social proof, and offer <strong>clear, repeatable formats</strong>—Target’s Supermarket Sweep copy or a simple five-question interview—so creators know exactly how to plug in. That structure keeps the brand in control and makes the collaboration irresistible.</p>

<h2>Title &amp; Content Framing</h2>

<p>People outside the platform still picture YouTube as nonstop goofy jump-cuts and sound effects. That view misses why the site works. <strong>Overproduction can actually kill the intimacy</strong> viewers want. When I shape a video, I always start with <strong>three questions</strong>:</p>

<ol>

<li><strong>Who is this for?</strong>  </li>

<li><strong>Why would they watch?</strong>  </li>

<li><strong>Is it unique to me?</strong></li>

</ol>

<p>Most teams skip the second one and assume a slick look or a celebrity cameo guarantees views. It doesn’t. I prefer to frame content around a role or an idea instead of a niche name. “<strong>NFL Player’s Life for 7 Days</strong>” beats “Hanging Out with Lane Johnson” because the broader audience grasps “NFL player” in one glance. Inside the Eagles building that feels odd—everyone there knows Lane—but the wider funnel doesn’t. The same trick worked when I called Jacob Collier “<strong>The Mozart of Gen Z</strong>.” His actual name sits in the thumbnail, yet the title invites viewers who have never heard of him.</p>

<p>I ask if a name is truly a <strong>zeitgeist name</strong>. Max Verstappen and Neymar qualify; most pros do not. If the name can’t carry the title on its own, I lean on the role.</p>

<p>Title writing is the whole game on YouTube, so I <strong>practice daily</strong>. I set a timer and draft <strong>30 titles in ten minutes</strong>. Most are trash, but the speed exercise surfaces the one keeper and teaches me what bad looks like. That habit keeps my instincts sharp and my content framed for real humans, not just insiders.</p>

<h2>Collaboration &amp; Repeatable Formats</h2>

<p>Brands keep asking me how to <strong>signal they want creator collaborations</strong> without drowning in random pitches. My answer is simple: <strong>build a repeatable show</strong>. When I say “show,” I mean a clear format that creators can slot into without guesswork—think Target’s Supermarket Sweep copy or even a bare-bones five-question interview. The moment the Eagles adopt that structure, appearing on their channel becomes a dream gig rather than a mystery brief.</p>

<p>Condé Nast proves the model works. One sharp mind there invented <strong>“10 Things I Can’t Live Without,” “73 Questions,”</strong> and WIRED’s <strong>“Autocomplete Interview.”</strong> Each format is instantly recognizable, endlessly repeatable, and packed with built-in aspiration. Viewers watch because they already trust the template; guests sign on because they know the exposure is massive.</p>

<p>A solid format lets me:</p>

<p>• <strong>Invite collaborators with crystal-clear direction.</strong> “Join our established show” converts better than “Pitch us anything.”<br />

• <strong>Slip product launches or campaigns</strong> into content that is already high-performing.<br />

• <strong>Hold full creative control</strong> while still <strong>amplifying reach</strong> through the guest’s audience.</p>

<p>That trio—established format, creative control, amplified reach—is the future. Most brands will need hand-holding to get there; making a show feels terrifying if you’ve only ever posted press releases. I keep reminding them it’s inevitable, and the sooner they craft a repeatable format, the sooner creators line up at the door.</p>

<h3>The Opening Minute</h3>

<p>I never split effort evenly across a ten-minute upload. The <strong>title, thumbnail, and underlying idea</strong> do the heavy lifting, but the <strong>opening 30 seconds</strong> decide whether that promise pays off. I’ll gladly pour <strong>20–30 % of the total production time</strong> into perfecting those first moments, tightening every line and visual so viewers lock in.</p>

<p>A sharper intro by itself won’t spin a video from 1 k to 270 k views—it works only as part of the full package—but without a gripping start, the rest of the craft never gets a chance. I front-load maximum value, a habit I partly learned from my friend Jimmy, and it’s the single most reliable way I’ve found to secure retention and honor the click.</p>
