<h2>Cybertruck Tunnel Takes Shape</h2>

<p>Freshly built <strong>Cybertrucks</strong> are now emerging from the <strong>Cyber Tunnel</strong> at Tesla's Gigafactory in Texas. Drone footage captured Cybertrucks exiting through a tunnel mouth designed in the shape of a Cybertruck's front end, complete with the signature light bar.</p>

<p>These vehicles roll off the general assembly floor and move directly into an underground tunnel. This tunnel drives beneath a divided highway and brings the trucks to a staging lot for delivery preparations. Currently, these Cybertrucks are <strong>driven by people</strong>, but the goal is for them to <strong>self-drive</strong> through the tunnel.</p>

<p>The underground passage was dug by Elon Musk's <strong>Boring Company</strong> in 2024 using the Proofrock 3 boring machine. The tunnel connects to a new extension housing the end of the Cybertruck production line and a giant water-cooled supercomputer data center for <strong>autopilot development</strong>.</p>

<p>The real advantage comes when the Cybertrucks can autonomously move from point A to point B without human drivers. This automation could save Tesla significant time and labor costs across thousands of vehicles. There's anticipation that this transition to self-driving will happen in the first half of the year, marking a significant milestone for both Tesla and the Boring Company.</p>
