<h2>Launching Robo Taxis in June</h2>

<p>We discuss Tesla's plans to roll out <strong>Robo Taxis in Austin in June</strong>. Elon Musk appears confident about the timeline, suggesting the launch might feature the <strong>Cyber Cab</strong>. Using Cyber Cabs could make a significant impact, drawing public attention with their unique design.</p>

<h2>FSD Progress and Safety Concerns</h2>

<p>Tesla's <strong>Full Self-Driving (FSD)</strong> software shows rapid improvement. Hans notes significant enhancements with each update, even on older hardware. However, recent FSD crashes highlight safety concerns. While some incidents are expected, they might cause regulatory delays or affect public perception.</p>

<h2>Market Impact and Wall Street Expectations</h2>

<p>We wonder how Wall Street will react to the Robo Taxi rollout. There's debate about whether Tesla's stock already reflects the potential of Robo Taxis. Initial profits might be limited due to costs like <strong>teleoperation</strong>, where human operators monitor vehicles remotely. Tesla's strategy to reinvest earnings for growth could also influence short-term financials.</p>

<h2>Tesla vs. Waymo and Uber</h2>

<p>Tesla's approach differs significantly from competitors like <strong>Waymo</strong> and <strong>Uber</strong>. Waymo operates with expensive hardware and limited geographic areas, while Tesla uses affordable cameras and scalable software applicable to all roads. We discuss whether Tesla will sell Cyber Cabs to fleet operators or maintain ownership to control the rollout and mitigate risks.</p>

<h2>Regulatory Environment and Future Growth</h2>

<p>The <strong>regulatory landscape</strong> plays a crucial role in the deployment of autonomous vehicles. A favorable stance from the government could accelerate Tesla's plans, especially in regions like China. However, bureaucratic hurdles in places like Europe might slow progress. We recognize that while challenges exist, Tesla's advancements could lead to a transformative impact on transportation and its own growth trajectory.</p>
