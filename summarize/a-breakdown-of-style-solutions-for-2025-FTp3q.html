<h2>Reflecting on Previous CSS Solutions</h2>

<p>A few years ago, I discussed various solutions for styling web applications. Back then, tools like <strong>Sass</strong>, <strong>Less</strong>, and frameworks like <strong>Bootstrap</strong> were popular. Behavioral libraries such as <strong>React Aria</strong> attempted to manage component behaviors but had limitations.</p>

<h2>The Rise of Tailwind and Radix</h2>

<p>Since then, <strong>Tailwind CSS</strong> has become a default choice for many developers. It offers a utility-first approach, making CSS more maintainable for large projects. <strong>Radix UI</strong> emerged as a powerful library providing unstyled, accessible components. It handles complex behaviors like focus control and keyboard navigation without prescribing styles.</p>

<h2>ShadCN: Bridging the Gap</h2>

<p>Recently, I discovered <strong>ShadCN</strong>, which combines the best of Tailwind and Radix. Instead of installing a package, you copy components directly into your codebase. This gives you full control over styles and behaviors. You can customize components to suit your needs without being locked into a specific framework.</p>

<h2>Moving Towards Modular Design</h2>

<p>The industry is shifting away from all-in-one solutions like <strong>Material UI</strong>. We're embracing modular design systems that offer flexibility and maintainability. By using tools like <strong>ShadCN</strong>, we leverage the strengths of various libraries. This approach allows us to update individual parts without overhauling entire systems.</p>

<h2>Embracing the Future of Web Styling</h2>

<p>I'm excited about these changes in web styling. Combining CSS extensions, behavioral libraries, and customizable components leads to more efficient development. The future is modular and flexible, allowing us to build scalable applications that meet our evolving needs.</p>
