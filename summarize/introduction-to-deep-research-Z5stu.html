<h2>What is Deep Research?</h2>

<p>We are excited to announce <strong>Deep Research</strong>, a new capability that enables models to perform multi-step research on the internet. Unlike traditional models that generate quick responses, Deep Research models think deeply, sometimes taking <strong>5 to 30 minutes</strong> to produce an answer. This extended reasoning allows them to <strong>discover, synthesize, and reason</strong> about content, adapting their plans as they uncover new information.</p>

<h2>How Deep Research Works</h2>

<p>Deep Research is powered by a fine-tuned version of our soon-to-be-released <strong>O3 reasoning model</strong>. Trained through end-to-end reinforcement learning on complex browsing and reasoning tasks, the model learns to:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Plan and execute multi-step trajectories</strong></li>

<li><strong>React to real-time information</strong></li>

<li><strong>Backtrack when necessary</strong></li>

</ul>

<p>It can browse user-uploaded files, use Python tools for calculations and creating images, and embed images from websites in its final responses. Importantly, it provides <strong>comprehensive, fully cited reports</strong>, similar to those an expert might produce.</p>

<h2>Demonstrations of Deep Research</h2>

<h3>Market Analysis with Deep Research</h3>

<p>Neil demonstrated how Deep Research can assist in performing a market analysis. By inputting a complex query about mobile adoption rates and language learning interests across different countries, Deep Research clarified requirements through <strong>follow-up questions</strong>. It then conducted extensive research, visiting numerous sources, and produced a detailed report complete with tables and clear recommendations.</p>

<h3>Product Research with Deep Research</h3>

<p>Josh showcased how Deep Research can simplify personal shopping decisions. By requesting recommendations for skis suitable for skiing in Japan, Deep Research asked for specific preferences and proceeded to research various products. It compiled a comprehensive report, including a comparison table, which assisted in making an informed purchase decision.</p>

<h2>Performance and Benchmarks</h2>

<p>Deep Research achieves new highs on several benchmarks:</p>

<ul>

<li>On <strong>Humanity's Last Exam</strong>, it attained <strong>26.6% accuracy</strong>, demonstrating advanced reasoning across expert subjects.</li>

<li>On <strong>GUA</strong>, which measures agentic capability, it reached new highs on all difficulty levels.</li>

<li>Internal evaluations showed that as the model spends more time thinking and browsing, its performance improves.</li>

</ul>

<p>While Deep Research reduces hallucinations more effectively than previous models, we advise users to <strong>verify sources</strong> when using the reports.</p>

<h2>Future Directions</h2>

<p>Deep Research is a significant step toward our vision of agents that think longer and more autonomously to solve complex tasks. We believe this ability to work on tasks unsupervised is crucial for advancing towards <strong>Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)</strong>. In the future, we aim to connect Deep Research to <strong>custom contexts</strong>, such as enterprise data storages, enhancing its utility across various domains.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p>Deep Research is launching on <strong>Pro</strong> later today and will soon be available on desktop and mobile. We are eager to see how you utilize this new capability to streamline your research and knowledge work tasks.</p>
