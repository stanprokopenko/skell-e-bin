<h2>Meeting Kim Jung Gi</h2>

<p>I recently had the opportunity to watch <strong>Kim Jung Gi</strong> perform in Los Angeles. Known for his amazingly accurate drawings from memory, he creates intricate works without any construction lines. Watching him fill huge sheets of paper effortlessly, was mesmerizing. It's not just drawing, it's a performance. He entertains the audience, cracks jokes, and keeps everyone engaged for hours.</p>

<h2>The Myth of Photographic Memory</h2>

<p>Everyone, including myself, is fascinated by his ability to draw anything from imagination. People often ask him about his memory, assuming he has a <strong>photographic memory</strong>. When I asked him about it, he denied having any unusual memory capabilities. He emphasized that while he might remember images longer than most people, his skill comes from <strong>drawing extensively</strong>. "I probably drew way more than people think I have," he said.</p>

<h2>A Lifetime of Drawing</h2>

<p>Kim shared that he's been passionate about drawing since childhood. Even in kindergarten, he was more visually advanced than his peers, drawing three-dimensional objects when others were still in 2D. Encouragement from those around him motivated him to pursue art further. Despite his parents' initial reluctance due to traditional expectations, he dedicated himself to drawing, often neglecting academics.</p>

<h2>Embracing Observation and Practice</h2>

<p>One of the key traits that make Kim exceptional is his <strong>keen observation</strong>. He constantly observes the world around him, whether it's people in a public bathhouse or the intricate mechanics of military equipment. "Observation skill," he told me, is crucial. He builds his <strong>visual library</strong> by studying subjects in detail and reinforces it through relentless practice. He believes that understanding the content allows him to manipulate and combine elements freely in his art.</p>

<h2>Drawing Without Constraints</h2>

<p>Kim is unapologetic about drawing whatever he wants, including content that some might find offensive. He expressed frustration with <strong>political correctness</strong> and limitations imposed on his work. "I used to draw whatever I wanted back when I wasnâ€™t famous," he admitted. Even though others try to restrain him, he continues to express himself freely. His family accepts his art, and he doesn't hide his drawings from his children.</p>

<h2>The Joy of Drawing</h2>

<p>For Kim, drawing is as natural as <strong>breathing</strong>. He enjoys the process more than the final result and often loses himself in his work without even thinking about what he's drawing. He hopes to maintain this joy for a long time. Despite his hectic travel schedule, he wishes to draw more for himself in the future, rather than always for an audience.</p>

<p>Watching Kim Jung Gi draw was inspiring. His dedication to observation and relentless practice is what makes him one of the best draftsmen in the world. It's not about a secret or special memory, it's about <strong>drawing a lot</strong> and loving every moment of it. I realize I should draw more too.</p>
