<p>In this episode of Book Club, where I've been distilling and discussing highlights from some of my favorite books for the last five years, we're diving into <em>The Almanack of Naval Ravikant</em>. This is one of the best books I've ever read about financial freedom. We'll explore the <strong>five key components of the Financial Freedom equation</strong> as outlined by Naval.</p>

<h2>1. Find and Build Specific Knowledge</h2>

<p>The first key idea from the book is to <strong>find and build specific knowledge</strong>. This concept can be a bit confusing, so let's break it down based on what Naval says in the book.</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Specific knowledge is knowledge you cannot be trained for.</strong> If society can train you, it can train someone else and replace you.</li>

<li><strong>Specific knowledge is found by pursuing your genuine curiosity and passion</strong>, rather than whatever is hot right now.</li>

<li><strong>Building specific knowledge will feel like play to you but will look like work to others.</strong></li>

<li><strong>When specific knowledge is taught, it's through apprenticeships, not schools.</strong></li>

<li><strong>Specific knowledge is often highly technical or creative.</strong> It cannot be outsourced or automated.</li>

</ul>

<p>Naval writes, "When I talk about specific knowledge, I mean figure out what you were doing as a kid or teenager almost effortlessly, something you didn't even consider a skill but people around you noticed."] Your mother or your best friend growing up would know.</p>

<p>For example, maybe you had an obsessive personality and dove into things, remembering them quickly. Or perhaps you loved reading sci-fi, absorbing a lot of knowledge rapidly. Maybe you played a lot of games and understood game theory well.</p>

<h3>My Own Specific Knowledge</h3>

<p>Reflecting on myself, there were broadly three things I was super into when I was a kid and teenager:</p>

<ol>

<li><strong>Reading a lot of books.</strong></li>

<li><strong>Building stuff</strong> - starting with Legos and airplane models, then websites and tinkering with web development.</li>

<li><strong>Teaching</strong> - I always enjoyed teaching students who were younger than me or helping classmates.</li>

</ol>

<p>This combination of factors is what Naval might call my specific knowledge. The intersection of reading, teaching, and building has morphed into the career I've stumbled into, making videos, writing books, and reviewing books. I didn't get here by setting out 20 years ago to become a YouTuber doing productivity stuff, and writing self-help books. It was more a case of <strong>pursuing what I was genuinely interested in and curious about</strong>, rather than trying to find the most efficient way to learn a skill that can make money.</p>

<p>Naval writes, "Specific knowledge is found much more by pursuing your innate talents, your genuine curiosity, and your passion." It's not by going to school for whatever is the hottest job, it's not by going into whatever field investors say is the hottest.</p>

<h3>Finding Your Own Specific Knowledge</h3>

<p>At this point, you might be asking yourself, <strong>what could my own specific knowledge be?</strong> Here are a few ways to think about it:</p>

<ul>

<li>

<p><strong>Internal vs. External Motivation</strong>: Ask yourself, what are the sorts of things you're internally, intrinsically motivated to learn more about? This is different from following market trends or doing something just because it's profitable.</p>

</li>

<li>

<p><strong>Process vs. Outcome</strong>: Are you focused on the process or the outcome? When you're building specific knowledge, you'll get lost in the process rather than being fixated on the result.</p>

</li>

<li>

<p><strong>Unique Combinations</strong>: Look for intersections or unusual combinations that are unique to you. True valuable specific knowledge often comes from combining interests in a way that might seem strange to others at first.</p>

</li>

</ul>

<p>For instance, Joe Rogan combines being a comedian, a fighter, a commentator, and an interviewer. Naval himself combines investing and philosophizing on Twitter.</p>

<h4>Questions to Help You Find Your Specific Knowledge</h4>

<ol>

<li><strong>What do you do on weekends that feels like play to you but looks like work to others?</strong></li>

<li><strong>What topics make you lose track of time when you're learning about them?</strong></li>

<li><strong>What unique combinations of interests do you have that seem unrelated?</strong></li>

<li><strong>What do your friends constantly ask your advice about?</strong></li>

</ol>

<p>These prompts can help you uncover your own specific knowledge by finding what you're innately drawn to and then building upon it.</p>

<h2>2. Embrace Accountability</h2>

<p>Having specific knowledge alone isn't enough if you want to build wealth or achieve financial freedom. There are plenty of people with deep, unique expertise who haven't achieved financial freedom because they're missing other components. The second key is to <strong>embrace accountability</strong>.</p>

<p>Naval writes, <strong>"Embrace accountability and take business risks under your own name. Society will reward you with responsibility, equity, and leverage."</strong></p>

<p>We're socially hardwired to <strong>not fail in public under our own names</strong>. But those who have the ability to fail in public under their own names actually gain a lot of power.</p>

<h3>Taking Risks Under Your Own Name</h3>

<p>In most industries, the people who make the most money are often those whose names are out there, and whose names themselves are on the line. For example, in medicine, doctors who are the most well-known tend to be those taking risks under their own personal name and building a personal brand. They're putting themselves out there, maybe they're known as the best orthopedic surgeon in New York, and patients actively seek them out.</p>

<p>Another example is Warren Buffett. Companies sell themselves to Berkshire Hathaway not because they care about the company but because they trust Warren Buffett. He's built a strong personal brand, professional reputation, and credibility around his own name.</p>

<h3>Being Accountable for Outputs, Not Inputs</h3>

<p>Another aspect of accountability Naval discusses is being accountable for <strong>your outputs rather than your inputs</strong>.</p>

<ul>

<li>

<p><strong>Accountable for Inputs</strong>: If you're an employee paid hourly, you're accountable for showing up and putting in the hours. Your time and the amount you get paid are closely correlated.</p>

</li>

<li>

<p><strong>Accountable for Outputs</strong>: If you're a freelance writer getting paid per article, you're accountable for outputs. The client doesn't care how long it takes you to write the article as long as you deliver it. You've decoupled your time from your earnings.</p>

</li>

<li>

<p><strong>Accountable for Outcomes</strong>: This is the highest level of accountability. For example, a freelance writer might say, "Don't pay me to write the sales page, but I want 20% of the sales increase that comes from my page." Here, you're accountable for the outcome.</p>

</li>

</ul>

<p>As you move up this accountability spectrum, from inputs to outputs to outcomes, you take on more risk, but the potential rewards are higher. You're also more invested in the success of the project.</p>

<p>Naval writes, <strong>"Accountability is a double-edged thing. It allows you to take credit when things go well and to bear the brunt of failure when things go badly."</strong></p>

<p>In modern society, the downside risk is actually quite small. Even personal bankruptcy can wipe the debts clean in good ecosystems. People will forgive failures as long as you were honest and made a high-integrity effort.</p>

<h2>3. Own Equity in a Business</h2>

<p>The third key component is to <strong>own equity</strong>. Naval states, <strong>"If you don't own a piece of a business, you don't have a path towards financial freedom."</strong></p>

<h3>Ownership vs. Wage Work</h3>

<p>If you're paid for renting out your time, even in high-paying jobs like lawyers and doctors, you can make some money, but you're not going to make the kind of money that gives you financial freedom. Without ownership, your inputs are closely tied to your outputs. When you're sleeping, you're not earning. When you're retired, you're not earning. You can't earn non-linearly.</p>

<p>Even doctors who get really rich often do so because they <strong>open a business</strong>, like a private practice that builds a brand, or they develop a medical device or procedure with intellectual property.</p>

<p>Naval writes, **"You're working for somebody else, and that person is taking on the risk and has the accountability, the intellectual property, and the brand." They're not going to pay you enough, they're going to pay you the bare minimum they have to get you to do their job. </p>

<h3>Paths to Owning Equity</h3>

<ul>

<li>

<p><strong>Join a Tech Company or Startup</strong>: You can work at a company that gives you equity in return for your work. Early employees in startups can become wealthy if the company succeeds.</p>

</li>

<li>

<p><strong>Invest in the Stock Market</strong>: You can invest in the stock market, but to make significant wealth, you'd need to invest large sums of money over a long period.</p>

</li>

<li>

<p><strong>Start Your Own Business</strong>: This is often the fastest path to wealth because you own a significant portion of the equity in your business, capturing the value you create.</p>

</li>

</ul>

<h2>4. Leverage</h2>

<p>Even owning equity by itself has limits. To achieve significant wealth, you need to understand and utilize <strong>leverage</strong>.</p>

<p>Naval writes about three broad classes of leverage:</p>

<ol>

<li>

<p><strong>Labor</strong>: Other humans working for you. This is the oldest form of leverage but not the best in the modern world. Managing people is messy and requires tremendous leadership skills.</p>

</li>

<li>

<p><strong>Money</strong>: Capital that you can invest or use to multiply your decisions. It's a powerful form of leverage but harder to acquire since it often requires someone to give you money.</p>

</li>

<li>

<p><strong>Products with No Marginal Cost of Replication</strong> - This includes <strong>code, media, books, and content</strong>. It's the most powerful form of leverage today because it's <strong>permissionless</strong>, you don't need anyone's permission to use it or succeed with it.</p>

</li>

</ol>

<h3>Media and Code as Leverage</h3>

<ul>

<li>

<p><strong>Media</strong>: Books, podcasts, videos, and social media are forms of leverage. You create something once, and it can reach millions of people without additional effort.</p>

</li>

<li>

<p><strong>Code</strong>: Software is incredibly scalable. You build it once, and it can serve an infinite number of users. Every great software developer now has an army of robots working for them at night, cranking away while they sleep.</p>

</li>

</ul>

<p>Naval emphasizes the importance of <strong>permissionless leverage</strong>: coding, writing books, recording podcasts, tweeting, and creating videos. You don't need anyone's approval to start, and they have a massive reach.</p>

<h3>Combining the Elements</h3>

<p>If you combine <strong>specific knowledge</strong> with <strong>accountability</strong>, <strong>equity</strong>, and <strong>leverage</strong>, especially through media and code, you set yourself up nicely to become wealthy.</p>

<h2>5. Be Patient</h2>

<p>The final key principle is <strong>time</strong>. Naval writes, <strong>"Be patient."</strong></p>

<h3>Great Things Take Time</h3>

<p>In the tech business, great people have great outcomes, you just have to be patient. It never happens on the timeframe you want, but it does happen. It takes time, even once you have all the pieces in place.</p>

<p>Naval says, <strong>"If you're counting, you'll run out of patience before success actually arrives."</strong></p>

<p>You have to enjoy the process and keep doing it without keeping track or counting. If you do, you'll run out of time before success comes.</p>

<h3>Focus on the Process, Not the Outcome</h3>

<p>This ties back to pursuing what you're genuinely interested in. If you're doing something that <strong>feels like play to you</strong>, you won't be constantly checking the clock, waiting to become successful or rich. Weirdly, it's the people who aren't seeking the money who tend to get it.</p>

<p>Naval writes, <strong>"You have to put yourself in the position with the specific knowledge, with the accountability, with leverage, with the authentic skill set. You have to be the best in the world at what you do. You have to enjoy it and keep doing it, keep doing it, and keep doing it. Don't keep track and don't keep count because if you do, you will run out of time."</strong></p>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p>I was initially unsure about making this video because I prefer creating content that's more actionable, providing step-by-step processes. But this book doesn't give you a step-by-step roadmap. Instead, it offers a philosophical way of thinking about wealth and financial freedom.</p>

<p>I've benefited enormously from this book by thinking differently about specific knowledge, accountability, equity, leverage, and time. If you're genuinely interested in becoming financially free, you can't expect to get there by following a simple step-by-step guide. If such a roadmap existed, everyone would follow it, and it wouldn't work anymore.</p>

<p>We've barely scratched the surface of what's in this book. There's a lot more wisdom about happiness, health, and the point of money. I highly recommend <em>The Almanack of Naval Ravikant</em> for its valuable insights.</p>
