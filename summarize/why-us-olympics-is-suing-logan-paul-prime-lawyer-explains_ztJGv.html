<p>The US Olympic and Paralympic Committee (USOPC) is suing Logan Paul's Prime Hydration for <strong>blatant trademark infringement</strong>. The complaint was filed in federal court on July 19th, 2024. Prime's partnership with basketball star Kevin Durant featured labeling and advertising that used the terms <strong>Olympic, Olympian, Team USA, and Going for the Gold</strong>. These are all registered trademarks owned by the USOPC.</p>

<h2>Background of Prime Hydration and USOPC</h2>

<p>Prime Hydration is a sports drink brand started by Logan Paul and KSI in 2022. Due to their marketing and collaboration efforts, the brand is now estimated to be worth billions of dollars and competes with brands owned by Coca-Cola and Pepsi.</p>

<p>The USOPC is a federally chartered corporation responsible for the training and funding of US teams for the Olympic, Paralympic, Youth Olympic, Pan-American, and Parapan American Games. Although federally chartered, the US government does not provide funding to the USOPC. Instead, the USOPC relies significantly on <strong>licensing its trademarks</strong> for funding.</p>

<h2>Explanation of Trademarks and Licensing</h2>

<p><strong>Trademarks</strong> are any kind of shorthand reference that allows a consumer to mentally link a product back to its source. They can include:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Logos</strong>: Nike Swoosh, Apple's apple, McDonald's golden arches</li>

<li><strong>Words and Phrases</strong>: Disney's "Hakuna Matata," Nintendo's "It's on like Donkey Kong"</li>

<li><strong>Colors</strong>: Tiffany blue, University of Texas's burnt orange</li>

<li><strong>Sounds</strong>: Darth Vader's breathing</li>

<li><strong>Trade Dress</strong>: The look and feel of packaging, like a Coca-Cola bottle, or the theme of a restaurant, like Hard Rock Cafe</li>

</ul>

<p>The purpose of trademarks is <strong>consumer protection</strong>. They allow consumers to purchase products with confidence, knowing the product comes from the company they think it comes from. This is important for accountability and maintaining standards.</p>

<p><strong>Trademark licensing</strong> is similar to a landlord renting out an apartment. The trademark owner allows another party to use the trademark for a specific purpose and period, in exchange for payment. The more exclusive the license, the more valuable it is. For example, Coca-Cola's exclusive license to use USOPC trademarks for beverages is a significant financial transaction.</p>

<h2>Specific Allegations Against Prime Hydration</h2>

<p>According to the complaint, Prime Hydration used four protected marks owned by the USOPC without permission:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Olympic</strong></li>

<li><strong>Olympian</strong></li>

<li><strong>Team USA</strong></li>

<li><strong>Going for the Gold</strong></li>

</ul>

<p>Examples of alleged trademark use include:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Labeling on Prime bottles</strong>: Referring to Kevin Durant as a "three-time Olympic gold medalist" and using phrases like "true Olympian," "repping Team USA," and "going for the gold."</li>

<li><strong>Social media and website advertising</strong>: Infringing uses on Prime's Instagram and website.</li>

<li><strong>Ad copy provided to vendors</strong>: Further infringing USOPC's trademarks.</li>

</ul>

<p>Despite receiving a <strong>cease and desist letter</strong> from the USOPC, Prime allegedly continued using these trademarks.</p>

<h2>Legal Implications and Consumer Confusion</h2>

<p>Yes, a company can own the rights to words like "Olympic" and "Olympian." Courts may find free speech implications if a word or phrase is too commonly used, but this is not the case here. This situation is more like the <strong>Super Bowl</strong> trademark protection, where advertisers hint at the event without using the term "Super Bowl" unless they are official sponsors.</p>

<p>The likelihood of <strong>consumer confusion</strong> is high. Consumers might think Prime is a sponsor of Team USA, given the common placement of USOPC trademarks on food products. Prime understands branding partnerships and exclusive deals, having sponsored teams like the Toronto Raptors, LA Lakers, FC Bayern, Arsenal, and the Dodgers. This suggests Prime either failed to do their research or willfully infringed on USOPC's trademarks.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p>In conclusion, this case seems to favor the USOPC. The trademarks are long-owned and registered, and Prime's use of them is likely to confuse consumers. What do you think? Do you believe Prime's use of these terms and phrases is likely to confuse consumers, or is the USOPC overreacting? Let us know in the comments below.</p>
