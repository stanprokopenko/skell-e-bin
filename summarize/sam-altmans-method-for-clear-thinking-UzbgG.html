<h2>The Ideal Notebook</h2>

<p>I'm a huge note-taker, and after lots of trial and error with different notebooks and systems, I've found what works best for me. Despite all the fancy notebooks out there, I prefer a <strong>simple spiral notebook</strong>. Here's why:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>You can rip pages out frequently.</strong> This is important because I often need to look at multiple pages at the same time. Being able to remove pages easily allows me to spread them out, and when I'm done, I can crumple them up and toss them.</li>

<li><strong>It lies flat and open on the table.</strong> When you're writing, it's essential that the notebook stays open without you having to hold it down.</li>

<li><strong>Hard front and back covers.</strong> A sturdy notebook provides a good surface to write on, especially if you're on the go.</li>

<li><strong>Portable size.</strong> I like a notebook that can <strong>fit in a pocket</strong>, so I always have it with me.</li>

</ul>

<p>The <strong>quality of the paper</strong> is also crucial. Most paper is terrible to write on, so finding one with a good feel is essential.</p>

<h2>My Favorite Pens</h2>

<p>The pen you use can make a big difference in your note-taking experience. My top choices are:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Uniball Micro 0.5 pen.</strong> In my opinion, this is the best pen overall. It writes smoothly and consistently.</li>

<li><strong>Muji 0.36 or 0.37 in dark blue ink.</strong> This pen is also excellent for its unique feel and ink quality.</li>

</ul>

<h2>How I Use My Notebooks</h2>

<p>I go through one of these notebooks every <strong>two or three weeks</strong>. I take a lot of notes, and I don't keep completed notebooks. Instead:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>I rip out pages</strong> when needed, so I can view multiple notes at once.</li>

<li><strong>Once done with a page,</strong> I crumple it up, and toss it on the floor. By the time our house cleaner comes in, there's often a pile of crumpled papers, evidence of my active note-taking.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Writing as a Tool for Thinking</h2>

<p>For me, <strong>writing is a tool for thinking</strong> more clearly. Even with the rise of AI technologies that can generate videos, music, and images from text, the act of writing remains irreplaceable.</p>

<h3>The Importance of Learning to Write</h3>

<p>I believe it's crucial that people still <strong>learn to write</strong> because:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>It helps you think more clearly.</strong> Writing forces you to organize your thoughts and ideas.</li>

<li><strong>It's like learning to code.</strong> Even if there might be fewer traditional coding jobs in the future, coding is a great way to learn to think. Similarly, writing sharpens your cognitive processes.</li>

</ul>

<p>If there's ever a better way to think more clearly using AI, I'd switch to that. But <strong>I haven't found anything that replaces writing yet</strong>.</p>

<h2>My Writing Process</h2>

<h3>Creating Focused Time for Writing</h3>

<p>I used to think I needed the perfect setup to write: the right place, noise-canceling headphones, the ideal mood. Now, I'll <strong>take any 11 minutes</strong> of uninterrupted time I can get:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Sitting in the back of a car</strong></li>

<li><strong>Lying in bed</strong></li>

<li><strong>Any spare moment</strong></li>

</ul>

<p>If I have the opportunity to set up the perfect writing environment, it would be <strong>Saturday morning with a cup of coffee and nothing scheduled</strong>. That's when I can tackle longer pieces.</p>

<h3>Balancing Interaction and Solitude</h3>

<p>I'm convinced there are ideas I would never have if I were just talking with people. I need to <strong>sit and type</strong> to access certain thoughts. It's about finding the right balance between:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Being with people:</strong> Engaging in conversations and being exposed to new ideas.</li>

<li><strong>Time alone:</strong> Thinking, writing, and doing deep work.</li>

</ul>

<p>My rough rhythm is:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Weekdays:</strong> I'm in the office non-stop, with no time to think, it's just crazily packed.</li>

<li><strong>Weekends:</strong> I have long, quiet blocks of time and I'm not really around people. This cycle is very important to me.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Long Breaks and Changing Rhythms</h3>

<p>I used to take longer chunks of time off, and I found it beneficial:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>A month of non-stop hanging out with people</strong></li>

<li><strong>A month of being alone in the woods or on the beach</strong></li>

</ul>

<p>That doesn't really happen anymore, but the pattern of alternating between interaction and solitude helped me recharge and think differently.</p>
