<p>Learn how to maintain the integrity of your drawing as you transition into painting. This guide will walk you through techniques to build up your drawing, think about illustration as problem-solving, and use mixed media to keep your drawing intact throughout the painting process.</p>

<h2>Materials and Tools</h2>

<p>Start with the right tools to set a strong foundation.</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Illustration Board</strong>: Strathmore 500 Series Cold Press Illustration Board. It has a consistent surface that won't buckle when painting.</li>

<li><strong>Pencils</strong>: Blackwing 602 pencils, or any in the B range (1B, 2B, 3B). Avoid H pencils as they scrape the board.</li>

<li><strong>Brushes</strong>:<ul>

<li>Script liner for fine lines.</li>

<li>Rounds and flats for general painting.</li>

<li>Large, soft brushes from the hardware store for washes.</li>

</ul>

</li>

<li><strong>Palette Paper</strong>: Wax paper works well for mixing paints.</li>

<li><strong>Acrylic Paint</strong>: Liquitex Unbleached Titanium White, stored in ketchup bottles for easy access.</li>

<li><strong>White Acrylic Ink</strong>: FW White Acrylic Ink by Daler Rowney. It's opaque and works with brushes or dip pens.</li>

<li><strong>Gouache</strong>: Warm and cool colors of your choice.</li>

<li><strong>Kneaded Eraser</strong>: Essential for lightening your drawing without damaging it.</li>

<li><strong>Reference Photos</strong>: Use your own photos to inform your drawing.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Building Your Drawing</h2>

<p>Start by <strong>interpreting text into visuals</strong>. If you're illustrating a concept, break it down into themes and icons.</p>

<ol>

<li><strong>Identify Key Themes</strong>: For example, "audio" and "detective".</li>

<li><strong>List Icons for Each Theme</strong>:<ul>

<li>Audio: headphones, microphones, records.</li>

<li>Detective: magnifying glass, trench coat.</li>

</ul>

</li>

<li><strong>Combine Icons</strong>: Look for metaphorical parallels and shape similarities.</li>

<li><strong>Use Reference Photos</strong>: Take your own photos to maintain control over design and style.</li>

</ol>

<p><strong>Tip</strong>: Your style emerges when you deliberately deviate from exact representations, taking ownership of shapes and designs.</p>

<h2>Preparing Your Drawing for Painting</h2>

<p>Before painting, <strong>lighten your drawing</strong> to prevent muddy colors.</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Use a Kneaded Eraser</strong>: Gently roll it over your drawing to lift excess graphite. This lightens the lines without erasing them.</li>

<li>This step ensures your pencil lines won't overly darken or mix with your paints.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Applying the First Wash</h2>

<p><strong>Seal your drawing</strong> and establish midtones with a diluted acrylic wash.</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Mix Acrylic Wash</strong>: Dilute unbleached titanium white acrylic paint with water until it resembles skim milk.</li>

<li><strong>Apply Evenly</strong>: Use a large, soft brush to apply the wash over your entire drawing.</li>

<li><strong>Blend Softly</strong>:<ul>

<li>Use a clean, damp brush to blend areas where you want softer edges.</li>

<li>This integrates the drawing with the initial paint layer without losing details.</li>

</ul>

</li>

</ul>

<p><strong>Benefits</strong>:</p>

<ul>

<li>Seals the drawing without toxic fixatives.</li>

<li>Establishes a midtone and affects the temperature of the piece.</li>

<li>Softens edges and unifies the drawing with the painting layer.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Adding Warm and Cool Tones</h2>

<p>Introduce temperature variations using gouache.</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Select Colors</strong>:<ul>

<li>Warm: Vermilion or another warm hue.</li>

<li>Cool: Cerulean blue or similar cool hue.</li>

</ul>

</li>

<li><strong>Apply Warm Tones</strong>:<ul>

<li>Add warm gouache to areas like cheeks, nose, and lips for a natural warmth.</li>

</ul>

</li>

<li><strong>Apply Cool Tones</strong>:<ul>

<li>Use cool gouache in shadowed areas to add depth.</li>

</ul>

</li>

</ul>

<p><strong>Tip</strong>: Don't worry about being too precise. The goal is to create subtle shifts in temperature that will add vibrancy to your painting.</p>

<h2>Working with Live and Dead Media</h2>

<p>Understand how different media interact.</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Dead Media</strong>: Acrylics become permanent once dry. They won't reactivate with water.</li>

<li><strong>Live Media</strong>: Gouache remains soluble and can be reactivated with water.</li>

</ul>

<p><strong>Technique</strong>:</p>

<ul>

<li>Use the permanence of acrylics to your advantage by sealing layers.</li>

<li>Leverage the flexibility of gouache for blending and adding subtle tones.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Building Up Values and Layers</h2>

<p>Gradually develop your painting by layering.</p>

<ol>

<li><strong>Deepen Shadows</strong>: Apply additional washes of acrylic to darken areas and enhance contrasts.</li>

<li><strong>Enhance Highlights</strong>: Build up layers of unbleached titanium white to lighten areas. The acrylic will interact with the gouache underneath, creating rich textures.</li>

<li><strong>Maintain Edges</strong>:<ul>

<li>Use larger brushes to create soft edges.</li>

<li>Switch to smaller brushes for details and hard edges where needed.</li>

</ul>

</li>

</ol>

<p><strong>Tip</strong>: Keep your values within a close range for a more nuanced and cohesive piece.</p>

<h2>Embracing Chaos and Soft Edges</h2>

<p>Allow your painting process to be dynamic.</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Use Big Brushes</strong>: Working with larger brushes than necessary can lead to unexpected and appealing results.</li>

<li><strong>Embrace Mistakes</strong>: Incorporate errant lines and brush strokes into your final piece.</li>

<li><strong>Blend Intuitively</strong>: Let the mediums mix naturally on the surface for organic transitions.</li>

</ul>

<p><strong>Philosophy</strong> - Don't have a monologue with your painting, have a dialogue. Let the process surprise you.</p>

<h2>Establishing Hierarchy with Contrasts</h2>

<p>Guide the viewer's eye through your composition.</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Control Values</strong>: Use contrasts in light and dark to create focal points.</li>

<li><strong>Shape Silhouettes</strong>: Emphasize important forms by carefully defining their edges against contrasting backgrounds.</li>

<li><strong>Lead the Eye</strong>: Arrange elements so the viewer looks at key areas first, then moves through the composition.</li>

</ul>

<p><strong>Tip</strong>: Hierarchy in your artwork holds the viewer's attention and communicates your message effectively.</p>

<h2>Tips on Problem-Solving in Illustration</h2>

<ul>

<li><strong>Start with Text</strong>: Use the written narrative to inform your visual decisions.</li>

<li><strong>Design Thinking</strong>: Focus on solving problems through your art.</li>

<li><strong>Use Reference Wisely</strong>: Reference is a tool, not a crutch. Adjust and stylize to suit your vision.</li>

<li><strong>Iterate and Experiment</strong>: Don't be afraid to try new techniques or materials.</li>

<li><strong>Value Structure</strong>: A strong value structure is the backbone of a compelling image.</li>

</ul>

<p><strong>Final Thought</strong>: Illustration is about communicating ideas visually. By preserving your drawing throughout the painting process and thoughtfully applying mixed media techniques, you can create dynamic and engaging artwork that solves visual problems and tells a story.</p>
