<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>Today I’m doing a quick rumor check and vibe read on the big AI labs as we head into fall. The buzz centers on potential releases like <strong>Gemini 3</strong> and <strong>Claude 4.5</strong>, and how recent model performance and messaging have shifted sentiment.</p>

<h2>Anthropic: Performance Dip and Narrative</h2>

<p>Anthropic had an unbelievable year, growing revenue from about 1 to 5 billion and becoming the coding model of choice. Then, late summer brought a rough patch. For about six weeks, users reported degraded behavior in Claude: broken code, claimed file edits that didn’t happen, random Chinese characters, ignored instructions, and wildly inconsistent outputs. Conspiracy theories about throttling spread. Anthropic denied intentional throttling and attributed issues to bugs that intermittently degraded responses. Regardless, the timing opened a door for competitors.</p>

<h2>OpenAI: Seizing the Coding Opening</h2>

<p>OpenAI targeted agentic coding with <strong>GPT5</strong>, especially <strong>Codeex</strong>. Early chatter was muddied by model deprecations and selector issues, but developers warmed up fast due to strong instruction following, guideline adherence, and optimized code. Many now say GPT5 Codeex beats <strong>Claude Code</strong> for precise, non-vibe coding tasks, and it quickly drew GitHub attention.</p>

<h2>Leadership and Open Source Comments</h2>

<p>Politics added noise. Reports say CEO <strong>Dario Amade</strong> openly challenged President Trump’s hands-off AI stance and skipped a White House dinner, drawing fire from critics. More impactful was Dario’s take that <strong>open source is a red herring</strong> for AI, since weights are not code and most usage runs in the cloud with offered fine-tuning and interpretability tools. The reaction was harsh, even from typically measured voices, and it amplified existing negative vibes.</p>

<h2>What Could Change Next</h2>

<p>Rumors point to a <strong>Claude 4.5</strong> release. If it lands and is great at coding, many will forgive the summer slump. Anthropic’s <strong>Keep Thinking</strong> brand campaign also landed well, and <strong>Microsoft 365 Copilot</strong> now includes <strong>Claude models</strong> alongside OpenAI, expanding real-world exposure.</p>

<h2>Where the Labs Stand Now</h2>

<ul>

<li><strong>Anthropic:</strong> Low vibes due to bugs and messaging, but a strong new model could flip sentiment fast.</li>

<li><strong>OpenAI:</strong> Gaining in coding with GPT5 Codeex.</li>

<li><strong>Microsoft:</strong> Pivoting from a single supercompute bet toward a <strong>distributed web of AI power</strong> focused on fast global inference.</li>

<li><strong>Google:</strong> Rumors of <strong>Gemini 3</strong> resurfaced, plus imminent updates to its coding agent. Vibes are extremely positive.</li>

<li><strong>Amazon:</strong> Back in the AI conversation via the <strong>Anthropic + AWS</strong> partnership and potential AWS growth acceleration.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Bottom Line</h2>

<p>The rumor mill wants new toys: <strong>Gemini 3</strong> and <strong>Claude 4.5</strong>. Anthropic’s vibe is down, but not out. OpenAI is competitive in coding. Microsoft is charting its own infrastructure path. Amazon reenters the chat. Google holds immaculate vibes. This can change fast.</p>
