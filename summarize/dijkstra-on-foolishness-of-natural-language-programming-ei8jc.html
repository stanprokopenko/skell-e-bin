<p>Recently, I dove into Edsger Dijkstra's essay <strong>"On the Foolishness of Natural Language Programming."</strong> Dijkstra always has thought-provoking insights, and this piece feels particularly relevant today, especially with the rise of natural language processing and AI.</p>

<h2>The Challenge of Formal Symbolism</h2>

<p>Dijkstra begins by addressing the early desire to make programming more like natural language. Since the advent of automatic computing, many have felt that the <strong>strictness of formal programming languages</strong> is a shortcoming. They wished for machines that could understand instructions in our native tongues, blaming the mechanical slave for <strong>strictly obeying</strong> instructions even when they contained obvious mistakes.</p>

<p>He points out that the <strong>obligation to use formal symbols isn't a burden but a privilege</strong>. Formal languages require care and precision, which helps us avoid <strong>nonsense that's hard to detect</strong> when using natural language. Thanks to formal symbolism, tasks that once required genius can now be accomplished by schoolchildren.</p>

<h2>The Illusion of Simplicity in Natural Language</h2>

<p>Dijkstra challenges the assumption that programming in natural language would simplify our lives. While it might seem convenient, he argues that <strong>natural language is inherently imprecise</strong> and can lead to misinterpretation. The <strong>additional burden on machines</strong> to interpret natural language could also increase complexity on both sides, making programming more difficult, not less.</p>

<p>He uses historical examples to support his point. <strong>Greek mathematicians</strong> struggled because their work remained a verbal and pictorial activity. <strong>Muslim algebra</strong> made initial strides with symbolism but faltered when it returned to a rhetorical style. Only with the advent of formal symbolism from thinkers like <strong>Vieta</strong>, <strong>Descartes</strong>, <strong>Leibniz</strong>, and later <strong>Boole</strong> did mathematics truly advance.</p>

<h2>The New Illiteracy</h2>

<p>Dijkstra also remarks on the <strong>decline in people's mastery of their own language</strong>, a phenomenon he calls the <strong>new illiteracy</strong>. As educational trends move away from intellectual discipline, many struggle to use their native tongue effectively, even when it's adequate for the task. This decline should <strong>discourage attempts</strong> to rely on natural language for programming, especially among those who lack the technical insight to foresee its pitfalls.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p>In pondering Dijkstra's essay, I find his arguments hold true even today. The precision required in programming is a <strong>strength, not a weakness</strong>. While natural language programming seems appealing, it may lead us into pitfalls due to the <strong>ambiguities inherent in human language</strong>.</p>

<p>As we continue to develop tools that interpret natural language, it's important to remember the <strong>value of formalism</strong>. Embracing the discipline of precise symbolic languages doesn't hinder us, instead, it <strong>empowers</strong> us to create more reliable and effective programs.</p>
