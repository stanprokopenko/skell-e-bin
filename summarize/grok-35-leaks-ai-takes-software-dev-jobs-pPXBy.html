<h2>The Shifting Conversation Around AI</h2>

<p>It's been an exciting time for artificial intelligence lately. I've noticed how the conversation is changing, even though AI isn't new to those of us deeply involved in it. While some people still have their heads in the sand, many are beginning to realize the profound impact AI is having.</p>

<p>There's ongoing debate about whether <strong>AGI (Artificial General Intelligence)</strong> is coming or if it's already here. Definitions vary, and some of us felt that our criteria for AGI were met last year. Ultimately, it's down to semantics since there's no universally accepted definition.</p>

<h2>AI's Impact on Jobs</h2>

<p>One of the most significant effects we're witnessing is how <strong>companies are actively replacing workers with AI</strong>. Forbes recently reported that many businesses are doing just that. For example, software development job postings are down significantly.</p>

<h3>Decline in Software Development Jobs</h3>

<p>Job postings for software developers have decreased by about <strong>35% from pre-pandemic levels</strong>. Even though the number of developers globally is still increasing slightly, the growth rate is slowing down. Entry-level positions are the first to be affected, making it tougher for new developers to find opportunities.</p>

<p><strong>Advice:</strong> If you're in software development or considering it, focus on <strong>AI and robotics</strong>. These domains still have growing opportunities.</p>

<h2>The Grok 3.5 Leak and AI Advancements</h2>

<p>Recently, there was a leak suggesting that <strong>Grok 3.5 outperforms existing AI models</strong>. While the leak's authenticity is still uncertain, it's possible given the resources behind it. This indicates that scaling AI models is more about compute power and less about secret techniques.</p>

<p>Competition among AI companies is driving rapid advancements. <strong>Intelligence is no longer the exclusive domain of a few</strong>, the methods to improve AI are becoming widely known.</p>

<h2>Adoption Curves and the Rise of Chatbots</h2>

<p><strong>Chatbots have crossed the chasm</strong> into mainstream adoption. Tools like Microsoft Copilot and chat integrations in various platforms show that we're moving from early adopters to the early majority in the adoption curve.</p>

<h3>Computer Using Agents: The Next Frontier</h3>

<p>We're currently in the innovators phase with <strong>computer using agents (CUAs)</strong>. These agents represent a layer above chatbots, capable of interacting with computers more autonomously. In the near future, I expect we'll see widespread use of agents operating in virtual machines, performing tasks with minimal human input.</p>

<h2>Reflections on Longevity and Mortality</h2>

<p>Thinking about AI's potential to solve significant problems got me reflecting on overcoming death through advances in technology. Even if we eliminate aging and disease, <strong>external causes of death remain</strong>. Statistics show that with current safety levels, life expectancy could extend to around <strong>800 years</strong>, but accidents and unforeseen events would still occur.</p>
