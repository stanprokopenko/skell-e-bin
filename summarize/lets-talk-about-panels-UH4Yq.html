<p>I recently launched a wallpaper app called <strong>"Panels"</strong> that I've been excited about for a while. However, I made several mistakes along the way, especially in communicating the app's purpose, features, and pricing. I want to explain everything clearly now and share what I've learned.</p>

<h2>Why I Created "Panels"</h2>

<p>For years, people have asked me, <strong>"Where did you get that wallpaper?"</strong> ** when they saw the backgrounds in my videos and on the devices I review. I wanted a place where I could point everyone to find those wallpapers, and support the artists who create them. That's why I decided to build <strong>"Panels"</strong>, an app that showcases wallpapers from talented artists, giving them more exposure.</p>

<h2>The Mistakes I Made</h2>

<h3>Lack of Clear Communication</h3>

<p>I didn't explain the user interface, the content, or the reason behind the app's pricing, especially the <strong>$50 price tier</strong>. This caused confusion and disappointment, and I take full responsibility for that.</p>

<h3>Pricing Issues</h3>

<p>Charging for wallpapers is niche, and I realize now that the initial pricing structure wasn't fair or well-communicated. Most people don't want to pay high prices for wallpapers, and I should have considered that.</p>

<h2>Steps to Improve</h2>

<h3>Enhancing the Free Experience</h3>

<ul>

<li><strong>Removed third-party ads</strong> from the feed to keep it clean.</li>

<li>Made all non-collection wallpapers available <strong>for free in 1080p</strong>.</li>

<li>Allowed access to full-resolution versions by viewing a <strong>single 30-second ad</strong>.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Introducing Affordable Subscriptions</h3>

<ul>

<li>Added a new tier at <strong>$2 per month</strong> that provides an <strong>ad-free experience</strong> and <strong>full-resolution downloads</strong>.</li>

<li>Offered <strong>Panels Plus</strong> for <strong>$12</strong> to unlock <strong>all premium collections</strong>, which individually would cost about $100.</li>

<li>Provided a yearly Panels Plus subscription for <strong>$50</strong> for power users who want everything.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Supporting Artists</h3>

<ul>

<li><strong>Splitting profits 50/50</strong> with artists to support them.</li>

<li>Artists retain rights to their work and can host it elsewhere.</li>

<li>The app links to artists' social media, promoting their work further.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Addressing Privacy Concerns</h2>

<ul>

<li>The app <strong>does not collect personal data</strong> or require location access.</li>

<li>Initial privacy disclosures were too broad, we've <strong>corrected them</strong>.</li>

<li>You can use the app <strong>without logging in</strong> or providing an email address.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Improving the App</h2>

<ul>

<li>Acknowledged that the app <strong>needs work</strong> in design and functionality.</li>

<li>Committed to making it feel more <strong>native on both iOS and Android</strong>.</li>

<li>Fixed bugs and will continue to <strong>update and improve</strong> the app.</li>

</ul>

<h2>The Future of "Panels"</h2>

<ul>

<li>Committed to <strong>weekly drops of new art every Friday</strong>.</li>

<li>Inviting artists to submit their work through a provided form.</li>

<li>Aiming to make "Panels" a platform for <strong>discovering new artists</strong> and their work.</li>

</ul>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p>I understand that I made mistakes with the launch of <strong>"Panels"</strong>, and I appreciate the feedback I've received. I'm committed to improving the app and making it a valuable resource for both users and artists. Thank you for your patience and support.</p>
