<h2>The Fed’s Independence Fight</h2>

<p>The episode opens with a live dispute over the Fed’s independence after President Trump fired Fed Governor Lisa Cook for cause. Cook sued, arguing the White House lacks authority to remove her. This tees up a larger question: how independent is the Fed in practice?</p>

<ul>

<li>Chamath sees the Fed as inherently political. He argues presidents appoint aligned governors and we should drop the pretense of neutrality. He suggests the Fed drop its most dynamic functions and let markets set rates using real-time data. He highlights publishing economic data on a blockchain and using pricing oracles so capital markets set the risk-free rate, while the Fed keeps narrower roles like supervision and payments.</li>

<li>Freeberg defends the need for an independent board that weighs short-term versus long-term rate tradeoffs, pointing to 14-year terms as a designed insulation from politics. He is open to revisiting term lengths through Congress rather than using investigations as a workaround.</li>

<li>Sacks contends Chair Powell acted politically. He cites Powell’s “transitory” stance through his renomination, then the rapid tightening that caused 2022 to 2023 market pain, plus a 50 bp cut before the election and a pause after. He frames this timing as political, not coincidental.</li>

<li>The group sparred over whether dissent within the FOMC disproves politicization. We land on this: the leader shapes majorities. Whether that is healthy or harmful depends on the timing and motivation of decisions.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Government Equity in Intel, and a Playbook</h2>

<p>Trump converted CHIPS Act support into a 10 percent nonvoting equity stake in Intel. The crew mostly supports swapping grants for equity.</p>

<ul>

<li>Chamath contrasts U.S. practice with China’s state-backed champions. He praises getting taxpayer upside instead of free money, citing past bailouts with no equity returns. He argues the United States should take equity in strategic sectors, maintain transparency, avoid golden shares, and let capital markets finance the rest.</li>

<li>Sacks agrees equity is better than freebies in national security cases. It is fairer for taxpayers and deters companies from seeking bailouts as a first resort.</li>

<li>Freeberg wants a home for this equity. He proposes placing it in the Social Security trust fund, transforming it into a sovereign wealth fund that compounds on behalf of retirees, which would require statutory changes. He warns if equity sits on the federal balance sheet, it is at risk of becoming another spending lever.</li>

<li>Chamath proposes seeding a sovereign wealth fund using capital from tariff deals and equity gains, with options to direct returns to debt reduction and Social Security.</li>

</ul>

<p>The table stakes: equity for strategic support, clear governance on where it sits, and guardrails so new assets do not become new spending.</p>

<h2>A Simple Spending Guardrail</h2>

<p>Grover Norquist praised a prior idea from the pod: cap government spending growth to population plus inflation, similar to Colorado’s model. We see this as a practical, nonpartisan constraint worth attention.</p>

<h2>Bankruptcies and Creative Destruction</h2>

<p>Large bankruptcies are up, but not at crisis levels. We see it as delayed cleanup of the ZIRP era and a sign of market digestion.</p>

<ul>

<li>Chamath highlights two forces: ultra-cheap money kept weak firms alive, and years of anticonsolidation policy limited acquisitions. With cheap money gone and M&amp;A constraints easing, creative destruction resumes.</li>

<li>Retail chains are vulnerable. Freeberg notes retail lease commitments act like debt. When foot traffic shifts online, the fixed lease burden crushes margins.</li>

<li>Sacks details commercial real estate stress. Refinancing at higher rates flips buildings to negative cash flow, lower valuations reduce proceeds, and equity holders must plug gaps they often will not. Many buildings may need to go back to banks so new owners can reset economics and fund tenant improvements. He sees rate cuts as important relief for this sector.</li>

<li>Capital is flowing toward data centers, not new office, intensifying the credit squeeze for traditional office projects.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Reversing Aging With Proteins and AI</h2>

<p>Freeberg outlines a major advance in cellular rejuvenation research.</p>

<ul>

<li>The <strong>Yamanaka factors</strong> (OSKM) can reset cells to a youthful state, but are inefficient and risky at high doses.</li>

<li>OpenAI’s fine-tuned model, <strong>GPT-4B micro</strong>, trained on protein sequences and structured bio text, proposed new protein variants. In partnership with Retrobio, these variants delivered up to 50 times greater efficacy, with 85 percent of cells expressing key stem cell markers by day 12 in tests.</li>

<li>We should be cautious. Over-pushing cells back to stemness risks cancer-like growth. Early human studies target specific disease indications first. Freeberg estimates 7 to 12 years to a first approved therapy using these mechanisms.</li>

<li>The bigger AI lesson: <strong>smaller, fine-tuned models</strong> for specific domains can be extraordinarily effective without massive compute.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Quick Note on COVID Policy</h2>

<p>RFK’s administration reportedly withdrew federal funding for mRNA vaccine development, removed COVID shots from CDC recommendations for healthy children and pregnant women, and requires physician consults for healthy individuals seeking the vaccine. The crew will return to this with more research, especially around the promised autism data.</p>
