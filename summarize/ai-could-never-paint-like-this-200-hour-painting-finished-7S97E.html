<h2>Oiling Out: Reviving Faded Colors</h2>

<p>When oil paint dries, <strong>shadows and colors can fade</strong>, making it hard to match new paint to older layers. To combat this, I use a mixture of <strong>half linseed oil and half odorless mineral spirits</strong> to "oil out" the painting. This brings back the <strong>vibrancy and sheen</strong> of the dried paint, allowing me to work seamlessly over previous layers.</p>

<h2>Working in Layers</h2>

<p>There's a lot of lore around oil painting techniques like "fat over lean," but I believe in painting however feels right. While I often <strong>paint wet into wet</strong>, for <strong>glazing</strong>, it's essential that previous layers are dry. This allows me to add depth and richness without disturbing the underlying work.</p>

<h2>Tackling a Full Scene</h2>

<p>I wanted to challenge myself by creating a complex scene rather than a simple portrait. This is my first time attempting a <strong>multi-figure composition with a narrative element</strong>. It's pushed me out of my comfort zone and helped me <strong>grow as an artist</strong>.</p>

<h2>The Importance of Stepping Back</h2>

<p>Working on such a large canvas, I make sure to <strong>step back frequently</strong>. It's easy to get caught up in details that aren't noticeable from a normal viewing distance. Taking breaks and viewing the painting from afar helps me focus on the <strong>overall composition and balance</strong>.</p>

<h2>Navigating the Ugly Painting Phase</h2>

<p>Every painting goes through an <strong>ugly phase</strong>. It's a normal part of the process, and I never let it discourage me. Instead, I push through, knowing that with time and effort the painting will come together. I don't leave paintings unfinished, I see them as <strong>challenges to overcome</strong>.</p>

<h2>Oil vs. Acrylic Paint</h2>

<p>I prefer <strong>oil paint</strong> because of its versatility and control. Oil allows for smooth blending, rich colors, and a variety of techniques. While you can use oil over acrylic, you can't use acrylic over oil. Oil painting has a learning curve, but once you understand the basics, it offers <strong>amazing flexibility</strong>.</p>

<h2>Repainting the Portrait</h2>

<p>I repainted the face multiple times, struggling to capture the <strong>younger version of Medusa</strong> I envisioned. Deviating from the reference image to de-age her was challenging. It required <strong>patience and persistence</strong>, but ultimately, I achieved the desired look.</p>

<h2>Embracing Creative Changes</h2>

<p>Sometimes, I change elements from the reference photo to better tell the story. In this painting, I intentionally misaligned the reflection of the hands to symbolize <strong>Medusa's transformation</strong>. Art allows us to take <strong>creative liberties</strong> to convey deeper meanings.</p>

<h2>Final Touches and Reflections</h2>

<p>After countless hours and overcoming numerous challenges, I finally completed the painting. <strong>Varnishing</strong> brought everything together, giving it a unified sheen. Looking back, I'm proud of the journey and the dedication it took to bring this piece to life.</p>
