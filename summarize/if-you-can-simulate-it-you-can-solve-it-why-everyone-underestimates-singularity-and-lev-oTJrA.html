<p>I've often been asked if I believe we'll reach longevity escape velocity or achieve indefinite lifespans within the next few decades. Many doubt this will happen in their lifetime. But here's the thing: most of us don't truly understand <strong>exponential growth</strong>. To see where we're headed, we need to trust the data.</p>

<h2>The Power of Exponentials</h2>

<p><strong>Moore's Law</strong> shows that computational power doubles regularly. Over the past 120 years, we've advanced from mechanical calculators to relays, transistors, integrated circuits, and now deep learning. This exponential growth isn't just continuing, it's accelerating.</p>

<h2>The Singularity Is Near</h2>

<p>According to <strong>Ray Kurzweil</strong>, we will reach <strong>The Singularity</strong> around 2045. Then, a typical computer's processing power will surpass the combined brainpower of all humanity. Some argue we'll hit diminishing returns, but we're far from the <strong>Landauer limit</strong>, the maximum computational efficiency allowed by physics. Our current computers are millions of times less efficient than this limit. Even the human brain, though more efficient, is not at the limit.</p>

<h2>If You Can Simulate It, You Can Solve It</h2>

<p>So why do I believe we will solve aging by 2045? Because, if you can simulate it, you can solve it. Biology and chemistry, including complex diseases, can be simulated with enough computational power. We've already made strides with tools like <strong>AlphaFold</strong> for protein folding. There are about 400,000 metabolic pathways in the human body, a manageable number for future computers.</p>

<h2>AI Improving Itself</h2>

<p>AI isn't just enhancing other fields, it's improving itself. Projects like <strong>AlphaChip</strong> from Google DeepMind use AI to design better chips, leading to better AI, a positive feedback loop. Hardware and software are mutually enhancing each other, accelerating progress.</p>

<h2>Trust in Data and Exponential Trends</h2>

<p>When people say solving aging won't happen in their lifetime, they underestimate exponential growth. As Ray Kurzweil noted during the Human Genome Project, mapping 1% of the genome meant we were halfway there because of acceleration. If computational trends continue, as they have for 120 years, for two more decades, we'll reach unprecedented capabilities.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p>It's easy to be skeptical, but the data is clear. We've lived through several technological shifts without always noticing. By trusting the data and understanding exponential growth, it's clear that solving complex problems like aging isn't just possible, it's probable by 2045. Let's trust the data and be optimistic about the future.</p>
