<p>For the first time in 7-8 years, I took a break from content creation and art. It wasn't a planned hiatus, but rather the culmination of <strong>ignoring signs of deteriorating mental health</strong> for far too long. I had always felt immune to burnout, continuing to work despite numerous issues. But last year, I reached my breaking point.</p>

<p><strong>The Darkest Time</strong></p>

<p>In what I can only describe as the darkest time of my life, I checked myself into a mental health retreat. For an entire week, I had no access to the internet or music. It was just me, face-to-face with the accumulated problems I had been avoiding.</p>

<p><strong>A Life-Changing Experience</strong></p>

<p>This retreat week changed my life. It gave me a new beginning and allowed me to reconnect with my soul. I believe that even in our darkest moments, there's a gift waiting to be discovered if we're willing to search for it. Hitting rock bottom provided an unexpected opportunity for growth.</p>

<p><strong>The Road to Recovery</strong></p>

<p>As I slowly return to my online presence and creative work, I'm excited to reveal the insights and experiences I've gained. I'm working on a new project that truly represents who I am as a creator. It's reinvigorated my passion for creating, and I consider it one of my best works to date. I plan to present the full vision of this new world next year.</p>

<p><strong>Looking Ahead</strong></p>

<p>Next year marks the 10th anniversary of my channel and creating under "Roth draw". I'm planning a significant moment to celebrate this milestone. After such a challenging period, I'm finally feeling hopeful again.</p>

<p>I acknowledge that it can be difficult to connect in today's world, with its excessive noise and stimuli. Despite this, I'm incredibly grateful for the support of my community and followers. I'm looking forward to sharing new content without experiencing burnout.</p>

<p>This journey has taught me the importance of mental health and self-care. I'm excited about this new chapter and can't wait to share it with all of you. Here's to growth, recovery, and creating from a place of authenticity and joy.</p>
