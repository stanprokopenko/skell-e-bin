<h2>Current Challenges</h2>

<p>This isn't the video I hoped to release today. I was excited to launch the <strong>Color Quest</strong>, a project my team and I have been working on for over a year. We had a fun coloring party recorded with people from the studio. Unfortunately, due to the current state of tariffs in US politics, I can't launch it right now.</p>

<h3>Tariff Issues</h3>

<p>Importing to the US has become prohibitively expensive. I'd have to raise the price of the Color Quest to a point I can't accept. There aren't alternatives since all alcohol marker manufacturers, except for the expensive Copic in Japan, are based in China. The tariffs make it impossible to balance affordability and quality as I've always strived to do.</p>

<h3>Previous Product Difficulties</h3>

<p>The Color Quest isn't the only challenge we've faced. Our <strong>Pro Sketch Pack</strong> didn't go as planned. The manufacturer we worked with went insolvent, owing over 12 million pounds to various debtors. Looking back, it explains the pressure I felt to sell more units than I was comfortable with. After all was said and done, we weren't confident we were paid our fair share, and communication was poor.</p>

<p>Similarly, the <strong>Customizer Kit</strong> hasn't sold as we'd hoped. We've invested a lot of time and work into it, but we're still holding onto stock that we need to move forward.</p>

<h2>Seeking Support</h2>

<p>With these challenges, we're in a difficult position. The content we produce is the most important thing we make, and in the past, product sales have supported our studio financially, allowing us to employ artists and editors.</p>

<p>I've also had a Patreon for the past two years. Your support there has been invaluable, helping fill gaps when product sales were low. However, our Patreon is now less than half of what it was when we launched.</p>

<h2>Looking Forward</h2>

<p>Despite these challenges, there's a ray of sunshine. I've fallen in love with writing over the past year. What began as a short story turned into a novella and now a <strong>novel</strong>. I'm finishing my debut novel, wrapping up the second round of edits, and sending it off to my editor soon.</p>

<p>It's set in the universe of my Space Bear Warriors, featuring Sam and her brother Aiden trapped in a mining colony amidst unstoppable aliens and immovable Prima warriors. I'm excited to share it with you, and it will be <strong>low cost and tariff-free</strong>!</p>

<p>If you're interested, I'm setting up a way for you to be notified when the novel is released. I can't wait to share this new venture with you.</p>

<p>Thank you for your continued support and for listening to this update. The fact that you're here means a lot to me. Together, we can navigate these challenges and continue creating content we're proud of. I appreciate you being here with me on this journey.</p>
