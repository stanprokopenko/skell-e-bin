<p>As someone passionate about art and technology, I've been exploring how to <strong>build powerful AI agents</strong> without being overshadowed by big tech companies. When majors release advanced agents, it can disrupt small developers. How can we <strong>stay ahead</strong> and <strong>build effective AI agents</strong> while remaining agile?</p>

<h2>Leveraging Single-File Agents with UV</h2>

<p>I've found that using <strong>single-file agents</strong> is a game-changer. By utilizing <strong>Astral's UV</strong>, we can bundle dependencies into a single Python file. This approach lets us <strong>move fast, iterate quickly, and scale compute usage</strong> without over-investing in the wrong tools.</p>

<h2>Building an AI Agent Step by Step</h2>

<p>Let me share an example of building a <strong>DuckDB AI agent</strong> in a single file. Using UV, we specify dependencies at the top, making it self-contained. The agent uses an <strong>agentic loop</strong> to select tools and solve problems autonomously.</p>

<p>Key components:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Tools</strong>: Functions the agent uses.</li>

<li><strong>Agent Prompt</strong>: Guides behavior.</li>

<li><strong>Compute Loop</strong>: Allows iteration.</li>

</ul>

<p>Including <strong>reasoning</strong> in the outputs helps us understand its processing.</p>

<h2>Scaling and Reusing Agents with AI Coding</h2>

<p>We can use <strong>AI coding techniques</strong> to create new agents rapidly. By leveraging an AI coding assistant like <strong>AER</strong>, we can transform our DuckDB agent into an <strong>SQLite agent</strong> with minimal effort. We write concise specifications and let the assistant handle code modifications.</p>

<p>Incorporating <strong>pre-verification steps</strong> allows agents to test their actions before executing final commands, ensuring reliable results.</p>

<h2>The Importance of Agents and Scaling Compute</h2>

<p>Agents allow us to <strong>scale compute usage</strong> and <strong>increase our impact</strong> in the age of AI. By designing effective agents with the right structure and tools, we can tackle complex problems efficiently. It's not just about building an agent, it's about building an <strong>effective agent</strong> that can adapt in a rapidly evolving tech landscape.</p>
