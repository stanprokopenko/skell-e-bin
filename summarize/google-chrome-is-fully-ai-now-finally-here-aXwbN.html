<h2>What changed</h2>

<p>Google rebuilt Chrome around <strong>Gemini</strong>, calling it the biggest upgrade since 2008. The browser adds <strong>context awareness</strong>: it studies what I search, read, and watch, predicts what I need, and responds in context. It can process pages in real time, recall sites I visited days ago, and link directly with <strong>YouTube</strong>, <strong>Maps</strong>, and <strong>Calendar</strong>. It blocks scams before they load, rewrites compromised passwords, and an <strong>autonomous browsing agent</strong> is coming to handle multi-step tasks with my final approval.</p>

<h2>What Gemini does in Chrome</h2>

<p>Gemini is now in Chrome on Mac and Windows for U.S. users in English, with <strong>Android and iOS</strong> coming next. On Android I’ll be able to hold the power button to summon Gemini, on iOS it lives in the Chrome app.</p>

<p>It reads and understands the page I’m on, compares across tabs, and recalls past sites. If I was shopping for a walnut desk last week, I can ask, “What was the site with that walnut desk I saw?” and it brings it up. It can jump to a specific moment in a YouTube video, add to my calendar, or pull a location from Maps without leaving the page.</p>

<h2>AI mode in the omnibox</h2>

<p>The <strong>omnibox</strong> now accepts <strong>complex questions</strong> and answers in place. On a product page, it can summarize and suggest follow-ups like “What’s the warranty policy?” or “Compare battery life.” It also acts as a direct line to Google’s <strong>most powerful AI search</strong>, letting me ask multi-part questions and iterate without switching context.</p>

<h2>Agent browsing (coming soon)</h2>

<p>The Gemini <strong>agent</strong> will run background tasks: book a haircut, fill a grocery cart from an email list, or draft a message. It keeps working while I browse, but will not take <strong>irreversible actions</strong> without explicit approval. Google has also explored an <strong>agentic payments protocol (AP2)</strong> for pre-authorized payments, not live yet.</p>

<h2>Safety and passwords</h2>

<p>With <strong>Gemini Nano</strong> embedded, Chrome spots scams like fake support pop-ups, bogus virus alerts, and fraudulent giveaways. Google says Chrome on Android alone cut about <strong>3 billion</strong> scammy notifications per day. Permissions and notifications get smarter based on my past choices and site quality. Chrome will act as a <strong>password agent</strong>, letting me change compromised passwords in one click on supported sites like Spotify, Duolingo, H&amp;M, and Coursera.</p>

<h2>Availability and why it matters</h2>

<p>This is rolling out first in the U.S. in English on Mac and Windows. Mobile is next. Workspace enterprise gets added protections. More regions and languages are planned.</p>

<p>Google is shifting Chrome from a passive window into an <strong>AI-first gateway</strong>. The real wins will be everyday: smarter tabs, instant article summaries, and protection that works quietly in the background. Potential pushback is possible if features feel intrusive, but Google is betting <strong>convenience and security</strong> will win.</p>
