<h2>Understanding Form</h2>

<p>Form is the foundation of effective shading. To shade well, you need to <strong>understand the form</strong> you're shading. The basic building blocks of form are <strong>spheres, cylinders, and boxes</strong>. Organic forms found in nature, like humans, animals, and trees, can and should be constructed from these simple forms to capture the character of the subject.</p>

<p>When shading, consider the <strong>hierarchy of forms</strong>:</p>

<ul>

<li>Primary forms (e.g., a cylinder for an arm) should be dominant</li>

<li>Secondary forms (e.g., bicep, tricep, deltoid) should be subordinate to primary forms</li>

<li>Tertiary forms (e.g., veins, wrinkles) should be treated as details</li>

</ul>

<p>Your shading should primarily reveal the largest forms, with smaller forms acting as details.</p>

<h2>Planes in 3D Objects</h2>

<p>Planes can be thought of as <strong>flat tiles arranged in 3D space</strong> to create a form. For example, a sphere has a front plane, top plane, side planes, and many more in between that together resemble a sphere. Though a sphere is rounded without flat planes, thinking of it this way helps imagine it as a 3D object and aids in the shading process.</p>

<p>When shading planes:</p>

<ul>

<li>Imagine which direction each plane faces</li>

<li>Compare it to the direction of the light source</li>

<li>The plane facing the light is the lightest</li>

<li>Planes progressively get darker as they turn away from the light</li>

</ul>

<p>Softening the edges between planes can indicate a softer form. However, sometimes leaving hard edges can help illustrate structure more effectively.</p>

<p><strong>Simplifying a form</strong> means decreasing the number of planes it consists of. In your mind, think of a few major planes for a given area, even if you're shading to give the illusion of millions of planes.</p>

<h2>Light on Form</h2>

<p>When an object is lit by a direct light source, you'll see a predictable pattern of lights and shadows. To make a form feel 3D, indicate all parts of the lights and shadows correctly:</p>

<h3>Core Shadow</h3>

<p>The core shadow is a <strong>darker strip at the edge of the shadow</strong>, dividing the light and shadow families. It shouldn't be uniform:</p>

<ul>

<li>In rounded parts, it's thicker with a softer edge</li>

<li>In thinner parts, it's thinner with a sharper edge</li>

</ul>

<p>Avoid drawing "racing stripes" down the form. Consider the 3D form you're indicating and adjust the edge quality accordingly.</p>

<h3>Reflected Light</h3>

<p>Fill in the shadow side with a clean dark value, lighter than the core shadow. This is <strong>reflected light</strong>, caused by bounce light and reflections from the environment. Start with a flat value, then add variations if necessary.</p>

<p><strong>Keep details within shadows quieter</strong> than details in the lights. Most of the story is told in the lit areas, so put interesting detail work there and keep shadows as areas of rest.</p>

<h3>Centerlight and Halftones</h3>

<p>Identify the <strong>point of the center light</strong>, where the plane faces directly to the light. Halftones appear as a gradation, darkest near the core shadow and lightest at the center light.</p>

<h3>Highlight</h3>

<p>The highlight is different from the center light:</p>

<ul>

<li>Center light is the plane facing the light</li>

<li>Highlight is the plane reflecting light relative to the viewer's position</li>

</ul>

<p>When the shadow is thin, the highlight will be close to the center light. When the shadow is large, the highlight will be farther from the centerlight.</p>

<h3>Cast Shadow and Occlusion Shadow</h3>

<p>These occur when there's interaction between two forms:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Cast shadow</strong>: Where one object blocks light from hitting another</li>

<li><strong>Occlusion shadow</strong>: The area that gets less bounce light, usually darker</li>

</ul>

<p>When drawing cast shadows, use them to describe the shape of the object they're casting onto, not the object casting them.</p>

<h2>Local Value and Intensity of Light</h2>

<h3>Local Value</h3>

<p>The local value of the object itself shifts the value range. For example, a white egg and a brown egg lit the same way will have different value ranges:</p>

<ul>

<li>White egg: Wide range from darkest core to center light</li>

<li>Brown egg: Compressed range, pushed darker</li>

</ul>

<p>The highlight is less affected by local value, which can make it appear very bright on darker objects.</p>

<h3>Intensity of Light</h3>

<p>The intensity of light affects the contrast between lights and shadows:</p>

<ul>

<li>Intense light creates more contrast</li>

<li>Dim light creates low contrast</li>

</ul>

<p>Light intensity can shift within the same object. You can use this as a compositional technique to guide the viewer's eye to the focal point.</p>

<p>Remember to practice spotting these elements on directly lit objects. With time and practice, you'll develop a keen eye for shading and create more realistic, three-dimensional artwork.</p>
