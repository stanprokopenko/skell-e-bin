<h2>Understanding U.S. Taxation Abroad</h2>

<p>Many believe that as Americans, we can't lower our taxes by moving overseas due to <strong>citizenship-based taxation</strong>. Unlike other countries that tax residents, the U.S. taxes its citizens no matter where they live. But there are ways to <strong>legally reduce our tax rate</strong>, even potentially to <strong>zero</strong>.</p>

<h2>Ways to Legally Reduce Taxes</h2>

<p>There are four main methods we can use:</p>

<ol>

<li>

<p><strong>Domestic Deductions</strong> - Stay in the U.S. and take advantage of tax deductions and strategies like investing in real estate for depreciation benefits. But this may involve <strong>inorganic behavior</strong>, making decisions solely for tax savings.</p>

</li>

<li>

<p><strong>Move to Puerto Rico</strong>: By relocating to Puerto Rico and utilizing <strong>Act 60</strong>, we can reduce taxes on passive income to as low as <strong>zero</strong> and on business income to <strong>4%</strong>. However, we must genuinely reside there and meet specific requirements.</p>

</li>

<li>

<p><strong>Move Overseas</strong>: By moving to any other country, we can use the <strong>Foreign Earned Income Exclusion (FEIE)</strong> to exclude up to <strong>$130,000</strong> per person per year from our taxable income. We have to meet either the <strong>Bona Fide Residence Test</strong> (establishing a new residence abroad) or the <strong>Physical Presence Test</strong> (spending at least 330 days outside the U.S. each year).</p>

</li>

<li>

<p><strong>Renounce U.S. Citizenship</strong>: The most extreme option is to give up U.S. citizenship, which frees us from U.S. taxes but comes with significant consequences and potential exit taxes.</p>

</li>

</ol>

<h2>Strategies for Entrepreneurs Living Overseas</h2>

<p>As entrepreneurs, we can maximize our tax savings:</p>

<ul>

<li>

<p><strong>Use Foreign Corporations</strong>: By setting up a foreign company in a tax-neutral jurisdiction, we can manage our business profits efficiently.</p>

</li>

<li>

<p><strong>Manage GILTI Tax</strong>: The <strong>Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (GILTI)</strong> tax affects profits over the FEIE limit. With proper structuring, we can reduce this tax to around <strong>10.5%</strong> on overage income.</p>

</li>

<li>

<p><strong>Leverage Foreign Partnerships</strong>: If we have foreign business partners or spouses owning part of the business, we may avoid certain U.S. taxes altogether.</p>

</li>

</ul>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p>While we can significantly reduce our U.S. taxes, we still have to <strong>file U.S. tax returns</strong> and <strong>report foreign income</strong> and accounts. Dealing with foreign banks and governments can be complicated due to additional reporting requirements. However, living overseas offers numerous benefits, and it's possible to take control of our financial future while remaining compliant with U.S. laws.</p>
