<p>OpenAI has had a busy week, and I wanted to share some of their latest developments with you.</p>

<h2>GPT-4.1 API Release</h2>

<p>On April 14th, OpenAI introduced <strong>GPT-4.1</strong> in their API. From my experience, this model significantly improves on coding tasks. I tested it by asking it to solve <strong>Advent of Code 2024 Day 3 Part 2</strong> in Rust. Impressively, it one-shotted the problem, generating correct code on the first attempt.</p>

<h3>Improved Coding Capabilities</h3>

<p>GPT-4.1 outperforms previous versions like GPT-4.0:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Higher accuracy</strong>: It scores 55% on the SweetBench verified accuracy, surpassing even GPT-4.5.</li>

<li><strong>Better tool usage</strong>: It follows diff formats reliably and ensures consistent tool usage.</li>

<li><strong>Fewer extraneous edits</strong>: It makes fewer unnecessary changes, streamlining coding workflows.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Codeex CLI: An Open Source Release</h2>

<p>Perhaps more exciting is the release of <strong>Codeex CLI</strong>, an open-source tool from OpenAI. Unlike other tools that claim to be open but aren't truly accessible, Codeex CLI is genuinely open-source under the <strong>Apache License</strong>. This means:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Commercial use</strong>: You're free to use it in commercial projects.</li>

<li><strong>Modification and distribution</strong>: You can modify, distribute, and even use it privately.</li>

<li><strong>Model flexibility</strong>: It allows you to use any AI model you prefer.</li>

</ul>

<p>I've found it functions similarly to other code assistants but with the added benefit of open-source flexibility.</p>

<h2>Potential Acquisition of Windsurf</h2>

<p>OpenAI is also in talks to purchase <strong>Windsurf</strong> for $3 billion. Windsurf is a favorite code editor among many developers, and this acquisition could signify OpenAI's commitment to enhancing developer tools. Given that Windsurf users have been testing GPT-4.1 recently, it seems like a strategic move.</p>

<h2>Comparing GPT-4.1 and 04 Mini High</h2>

<p>I also tested <strong>04 Mini High</strong> on coding tasks. While it's a decent model, GPT-4.1 stands out:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Efficiency</strong>: GPT-4.1 solves problems more directly without over-analyzing.</li>

<li><strong>User experience</strong>: It provides smoother workflows with fewer iterations.</li>

</ul>

<p>For example, when asking 04 Mini High to implement a search filter in a React Native app, it worked but required more steps and clarifications. GPT-4.1 handled similar tasks more efficiently.</p>

<p>OpenAI's recent updates, especially GPT-4.1 and Codeex CLI, show significant strides in AI coding assistance. As someone who appreciates tools that enhance creativity and productivity, I'm excited about these developments. They not only improve coding workflows but also make advanced AI tools more accessible.</p>
