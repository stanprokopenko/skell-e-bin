<p>Not too long ago, I grappled with how to grow my small business. Should I start an agency? Offer courses? Launch a membership? Provide training services? Productize? Host VIP days? What's the right model for me?</p>

<p>Over seven years, I explored various business models, learning the good, the bad, and the ugly of each. I've identified <strong>five common personality types</strong> among founders and leaders, and matched them with suitable business models based on my experiences.</p>

<h2>The Five Personality Types and Their Ideal Business Models</h2>

<h3>The Architect: Course Creator</h3>

<p><strong>Architects</strong> love perfecting experiences and building something that others can navigate on their own time. They enjoy crafting beautiful products without needing immediate feedback. If this sounds like you, becoming a <strong>course creator</strong> might be your path.</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Pros:</strong> Freedom to design your own schedule, low-touch fulfillment, and potential for sales while you sleep.</li>

<li><strong>Cons:</strong> Requires self-motivation and strong marketing skills. The freedom can be a double-edged sword if you're not disciplined.</li>

</ul>

<h3>The Fixer: Custom Services</h3>

<p><strong>Fixers</strong> thrive on diving deep to solve new and unexpected challenges. Each project feels like a fresh adventure. If you love helping and solving unique problems, offering <strong>custom services</strong> is likely a good fit.</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Pros:</strong> High touch with clients, easier to sell without a big audience, and you can charge premium prices.</li>

<li><strong>Cons:</strong> Potential for scope creep, intense client communication, and the need for strong boundaries.</li>

</ul>

<h3>The Teacher: Training Services</h3>

<p><strong>Teachers</strong> enjoy translating advanced concepts into simple terms and seeing the "aha" moments in others. If you love the art of teaching and impacting people directly, providing <strong>training services</strong> could be ideal.</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Pros:</strong> Reusable materials, less client work per week, and predictable schedule.</li>

<li><strong>Cons:</strong> Performance pressure, need to honor scheduled commitments, and can be emotionally demanding.</li>

</ul>

<h3>The Craftsman: Productized Services</h3>

<p><strong>Craftsmen</strong> love perfecting their craft and getting better with each project. If you aim to be a leader in your space through mastery, offering <strong>productized services</strong> suits you.</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Pros:</strong> Best of both worlds, custom deliverables with fixed processes, easier to sell, and no custom proposals.</li>

<li><strong>Cons:</strong> Requires strong processes and selecting a good niche. Risk of reduced quality if overloaded.</li>

</ul>

<h3>The Host: Memberships and Group Programs</h3>

<p><strong>Hosts</strong> find meaning in connecting people and fostering communities. If youâ€™re motivated by networking and building relationships, creating <strong>online memberships or group programs</strong> is your niche.</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Pros:</strong> Flexible schedule, ability to reuse content, and potential for recurring revenue.</li>

<li><strong>Cons:</strong> Risk of content and engagement burnout, tech and people headaches, and need to drive continuous engagement.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Choose Your Path Wisely</h2>

<p>Each business model comes with its own demands on your time, energy, and resources. Consider your personality and what motivates you when choosing your path. Remember, it's important to find a model that not only fits your business goals but also aligns with who you are.</p>
