<h2>Why I avoid blending</h2>

<p>I prefer to not blend my paint, at least until the end. It is a taste thing, but it is a big part of how I get loose, expressive work that still reads accurately. Look at John Singer Sargent. Up close the brushwork looks simple and unblended, but from a distance it clicks into a photoreal look. When we blend, the paint often loses its punch and richness.</p>

<h2>Use thick paint and the right brushes</h2>

<p>To paint over wet paint, I need <strong>thicker paint</strong> on the brush. If the paint keeps mixing into what is on the canvas, it is usually because there is not enough paint loaded. Put out enough paint on the palette so you do not subconsciously ration it. Avoid the end-of-session habit of stretching thin pools of color.</p>

<p>Use sturdy <strong>oil painting brushes</strong> that hold paint and push it around. Very soft watercolor or acrylic brushes lay down tiny amounts and encourage fiddling. Get comfortable with bigger, stronger brushes.</p>

<p>A simple exercise that helps: on a 9x12 panel, squeeze out full tubes of the primaries and white, and use all of it on that one painting. It overcorrects the thin-paint habit.</p>

<h2>Build transitions by placement, not smearing</h2>

<p>When two colors or values meet, do not feather them together. Instead, <strong>mix a middle value</strong> and place it between. For a softer gradient, add more steps: slightly different values placed next to each other. This works at any scale. With a small flat, I still lay down tiny shapes of paint to adjust transitions.</p>

<p>Think of late-stage marks like <strong>stickers</strong>. Apply a mark and leave it. Then put other marks around it to make it do what you want.</p>

<h2>Work big to small and keep your distance</h2>

<p>Early on, I focus on <strong>big shapes</strong>. As the painting develops, I refine with smaller and smaller transitions. To stay out of the weeds, keep an <strong>armâ€™s length</strong> from both canvas and reference for the first hour or two. See shapes, place paint, and resist fussing.</p>

<h2>Scale, studies, and reps</h2>

<p>It is easier to build up thick paint on <strong>smaller canvases</strong>. Bigger work just takes more time and paint. For practice, aim for paintings that take <strong>one to three sittings</strong>. On canvas pads, tape off small rectangles and fit multiple studies on a page.</p>

<h2>Medium and consistency</h2>

<p>I still use <strong>medium</strong> to adjust consistency when needed, but less and less as I go. In the end stages, I often use straight, thick paint. Quality paint also reduces the need to alter it.</p>
