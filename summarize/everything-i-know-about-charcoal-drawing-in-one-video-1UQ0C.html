<p>A year ago, I rekindled my relationship with <strong>charcoal</strong>. Previously, I'd found it messy and frustrating, and I preferred the tidiness of graphite. But graphite never gave me the rich, deep blacks I craved, my drawings always felt too gray and shiny. Being a lover of black and white imagery, and especially drawn to crows and ravens, I decided to give charcoal another chance. Everything clicked.</p>

<p>With charcoal, I felt I could freely express myself. I embraced the messiness, using my hands to blend and even finger-paint with powdered charcoal. Drawing corvids in charcoal complemented their colors perfectly and allowed me to capture their essence.</p>

<p>I discovered <strong>pan pastels</strong>, compressed pastel in a pan applied with sponge-tipped tools. They offer buttery smooth application and incredible control over gradients and strokes. Combined with traditional charcoal tools, they expanded my creative possibilities.</p>

<p><strong>My Essential Tools:</strong></p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Pan Pastels:</strong> For smooth, controllable application.</li>

<li><strong>Charcoal Pencils:</strong> Soft, medium, and hard. I prefer soft pencils for blending and fine details, using blending stumps for smoothing.</li>

<li><strong>Erasers:</strong><ul>

<li><strong>Kneaded Eraser:</strong> Moldable, leaves no residue, perfect for lifting highlights and creating textures.</li>

<li><strong>Mechanical Eraser:</strong> For crisp highlights and fine lines, though it leaves some residue.</li>

</ul>

</li>

<li><strong>Paper:</strong> I experiment with different papers. Smooth paper gives an airbrushed look and is more erasable, while textured paper holds deeper blacks but is harder to erase.</li>

<li><strong>Sharpening Tools:</strong> I use a utility knife to sharpen my pencils, exposing more charcoal for shading.</li>

</ul>

<p><strong>My Process:</strong></p>

<p>I start by toning the paper with pan pastel, creating a mid-tone base. Then, I lift out highlights with the kneaded eraser, essentially drawing in reverse. I block in the basic shapes with charcoal, working back and forth between adding darks and lifting lights. This freedom to work from light to dark and vice versa feels luxurious compared to watercolors.</p>

<p>To avoid smudging, I use a homemade stick to rest my hand on while drawing. I enjoy the tactile experience of working with charcoal and the ability to tweak and mold the drawing until I'm satisfied.</p>

<p><strong>Final Touches:</strong></p>

<p>To preserve my drawings, I apply spray <strong>fixative</strong> in a well-ventilated area. It's essential for protecting the artwork from smudging, though I prefer to limit its use due to the fumes.</p>

<p>Exploring charcoal has been a transformative experience. It's a medium that allows me to fully express myself and capture the beauty of my favorite subjects. If you've ever felt drawn to its rich textures and tones, I encourage you to give charcoal a try.</p>
