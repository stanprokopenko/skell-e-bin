<h2>Recognizing the Potential of GPT-4</h2>

<p>Jake Heller, founder of CaseText, had a pivotal moment when he first saw GPT-4. Within 48 hours, he and his co-founder decided to pivot their entire company of <strong>120 people</strong> to focus on integrating this powerful AI technology. Jake recalls, "This was their first ever experience talking to this godlike feeling AI that was all of a sudden doing these tasks that would take me when I practiced like a whole day, and it's being done in a minute and a half."</p>

<h2>Pivoting the Company in 48 Hours</h2>

<p>We understand the challenge of shifting an entire company's focus so rapidly. Jake led by example, building the first version of their new product himself. Despite skepticism from employees and board members, the reaction from early customers validated the decision. "We saw people go through existential crises live," Jake noted, as clients realized the profound impact of this technology.</p>

<h2>Building CoCounsel: An AI Legal Assistant</h2>

<p>Jake's team created <strong>CoCounsel</strong>, an AI legal assistant capable of performing tasks like reviewing millions of documents for evidence of fraud and conducting comprehensive legal research. To achieve this, they broke down complex legal tasks into <strong>step-by-step processes</strong>, ensuring accuracy and reliability. They emphasized <strong>test-driven development</strong>, creating thousands of tests for each component to guarantee the AI's performance.</p>

<h3>Ensuring Accuracy in Legal AI</h3>

<p>In the legal field, <strong>accuracy is paramount</strong>. Jake's team understood that even minor mistakes could erode trust in their product. By meticulously crafting prompts and iterating based on test results, they achieved a high level of precision. They moved from <strong>70% accuracy to nearly 100%</strong>, overcoming the common critique that AI often "hallucinates" or makes errors.</p>

<h2>The Impact of CoCounsel</h2>

<p>The launch of CoCounsel transformed CaseText. Interest in their AI solutions soared, leading to their acquisition by Thomson Reuters for <strong>$650 million</strong>. Jake observed that before CoCounsel, many lawyers were resistant to change. After experiencing the capabilities of GPT-4, however, they recognized the need to embrace AI. "All of a sudden, everything changed, and that's what real product-market fit looks like," he said.</p>

<h2>Lessons Learned</h2>

<p>From Jake's experience, we learn the importance of <strong>seizing transformative opportunities</strong>. Recognizing the potential of GPT-4 early allowed CaseText to leap ahead of competitors. Additionally, the commitment to building <strong>reliable, accurate AI solutions</strong> ensured that their product met the high standards required in the legal industry.</p>
