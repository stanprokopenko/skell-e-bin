<h2>Texas Bill on Obscene Depictions</h2>

<p>I saw a Dexerto article stating that Texas senators have unanimously passed a bill that, if signed into law, could make several games, anime, and manga series illegal to own in the state. The bill bans any <strong>obscene depiction of a minor or someone who looks like one</strong>.</p>

<h2>Hasan's Implications About Me</h2>

<p>Hasan went on his stream and implied that I would now have to delete half of my library because of this law. He posted the article with a picture of me in danger, clearly implying that I like <strong>obscene depictions of underage characters in anime</strong>. This is an outrageous and unhinged accusation.</p>

<h2>My Response to the Accusation</h2>

<p>I hope even those who disagree with me can see how <strong>messed up</strong> this is. Hasan is implying one of the worst things you can say about someone. In all the times Hasan was slandered or misrepresented, like when he was falsely accused of being at a brothel involved in illegal activities, I never brought it up because I knew it was nonsense.</p>

<h2>Commitment to Fairness</h2>

<p>It's disappointing to see Hasan stoop to this level. Unlike him, I have no problem with personal attacks, but this is a step too far. Hasan has no problem <strong>lying, misrepresenting</strong>, and weaponizing his audience to make his point. Despite this, I will continue to treat Hasan fairly. I respect your intelligence and always try to provide a fair take, even on the most unfair people.</p>
