<h2>Edge Basics</h2>

<p>An edge is the transition between shapes, how fast one becomes the other. Unlike borders, edges sit on a spectrum from sharp to soft. Value contrast affects how noticeable an edge is, and edges between light and shadow often carry the most information about form.</p>

<h2>Types and Making Edges</h2>

<p>Use four practical types, <strong>Sharp</strong> (no transition), <strong>Firm</strong> (slight blur), <strong>Soft</strong> (gradual), <strong>Lost</strong> (boundary disappears from extreme blur or by matching values). Lost edges can come from identical neighboring values, not just blur. Edge quality is how you execute edges with your medium, sharpen with an eraser or a subtle line to boost contrast, soften by tilting the pencil or using a blending stick, shammy, or finger, break up and texture soft edges for different feels. Edges apply to silhouettes and internal shapes, and a single edge can shift from sharp to soft as it travels along a form.</p>

<h2>Edges for Form, Light, and Design</h2>

<p>Edges communicate 3D form, sharp implies a sudden plane change, firm a rounded corner, and soft a large round form. Cast shadows reveal light, diffused light gives soft edges, direct light gives sharp, edges sharpen as the caster and receiver get closer. Use edges for design and mood, sharpen for focal points, soften to push back, and lose edges to simplify and group shapes. Not all edges describe form, like the glow around a bulb or a sky gradient.</p>

<h2>Practice</h2>

<p>Observe from life under varied lighting and match the edge you see. Start with form, then add design choices. With every stroke, decide: sharp, firm, soft, or lost.</p>
