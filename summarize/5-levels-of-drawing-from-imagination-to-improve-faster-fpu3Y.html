<h2>Core idea</h2>

<p>When artists draw straight from imagination, they are not skipping construction. They have decades of mileage and do the framing and shaping in their heads. To build that skill, I use five levels. They are not a strict path. I jump between them to train my eye, memory, and decision making at different difficulties.</p>

<h2>Level 1: Basic forms in perspective</h2>

<p>Drawing from imagination is really about manipulating form in perspective. I isolate those two variables and practice the most basic forms with volume. I use a forgiving tool like pencil or ballpoint so I can focus on accuracy, not a decisive brush line.</p>

<p>I organize forms in simple spatial games:

- Circulating around one another

- Clustered or stacking

- Expanding into space</p>

<p>If I can do this cleanly, I am already drawing from imagination. This becomes the foundation for cars, buildings, and anything else.</p>

<h2>Level 2: Sketching</h2>

<p>Sketching is iterative. I change my story and my image as I go. I use ballpoint or pencil with an eraser so I am not beholden to a single decisive line. I can start a line, test an idea, and correct it. This is how many concept artists work. It is not about skill level. It affects how hard it is to make finished illustrations. Often this level gives me the best drawings because I give myself room to iterate.</p>

<h2>Level 3: Preconstruction</h2>

<p>Here I step into direct drawing. I block in boxes and mannequins first as placeholders for perspective and form, then draw objects and people within them. This reduces what I need to hold in my head. I can make this easier or harder by how detailed the boxes or mannequins are. I may switch to a brush pen for the inking stage, but I stay loose during the setup.</p>

<h2>Level 4: Assisted freehand</h2>

<p>I remove the forms and keep only a perspective grid. I draw everything directly on the grid using my knowledge of vanishing point, horizon line, and scale. A helpful rule: anything that crosses the horizon line will do so at the same or similar place across the scene. I can scale difficulty by simplifying the grid, even down to only a horizon line.</p>

<h2>Level 5: Direct freehand</h2>

<p>Blank page. I rely on what I practiced. At minimum, I imagine a horizon line to ground the scene and scale. I draw through forms to understand space and keep perspective consistent.</p>

<h2>How I practice</h2>

<p>I do not move through the levels chronologically. I rotate them. I draw through forms, deconstruct objects, and build mannequins in space. I also keep studying from observation. I can only draw on what I have already studied.</p>
