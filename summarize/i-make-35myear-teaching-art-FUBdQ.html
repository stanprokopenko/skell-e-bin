<p>In this article, we explore how Stan, the creator behind Proko, built a $3.5 million per year business teaching art online. He achieved this without getting famous or selling his work in exclusive galleries.</p>

<h2>Early Challenges</h2>

<p>Stan initially pursued fine art, aiming to sell his paintings in galleries. However, the 2007 financial crisis hit the art market hard, and people stopped buying art. Despite this setback, Stan refused to give up on his dream.</p>

<h2>Pivot to Teaching and YouTube</h2>

<p>Having developed a passion for teaching early on, Stan began teaching art at the age of 20. In 2012, he started uploading videos to YouTube. His first video gained <strong>10,000 subscribers in 24 hours</strong>, surpassing his expectations.</p>

<h2>Discovering Online Art Education Demand</h2>

<p>People began asking Stan for DVDs of his content. He realized there was a <strong>massive demand for online art education</strong>, especially high-quality instructional content. Selling DVDs proved successful, prompting him to focus on online teaching.</p>

<h2>Emphasizing Quality and Evergreen Content</h2>

<p>Stan's videos stood out due to their high production quality, and concise scripting. He focused on creating <strong>evergreen</strong> content, timeless topics like drawing fundamentals and anatomy that remain relevant over time. His videos were <strong>short, engaging, and packed with value</strong>.</p>

<h2>Reinvesting in the Business</h2>

<p>For eight years, Stan reinvested all profits back into his business. He hired more people, improved production quality, and developed a custom website for Proko.com. This commitment to growth allowed him to scale his offerings significantly.</p>

<h2>Building a Team and Collaborative Platform</h2>

<p>Recognizing that he couldn't create all the content alone, Stan began partnering with other instructors. He expanded his production team to help teachers unfamiliar with video production create courses. Proko.com evolved into a platform offering a wide range of art courses.</p>

<h2>Harnessing Word of Mouth and Organic Growth</h2>

<p>Stan focused on delivering high-quality content rather than paid advertising. His videos were shared organically, with teachers using them in classrooms. <strong>Word of mouth</strong> became a powerful driver of growth, building trust and credibility.</p>

<h2>Future-Proofing Through Quality and Value</h2>

<p>By consistently providing valuable, high-quality content, Stan ensured his videos remained relevant. His commitment to not being satisfied with just one win, but continuously striving for improvement, set Proko apart.</p>
