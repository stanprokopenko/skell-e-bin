<p>At OpenAI, we're working on a groundbreaking new technology codenamed "Strawberry," which is believed to be the same as the previously leaked "Q*" (Q-star) project. This development represents a significant step forward in AI reasoning capabilities, and I'm excited to share what we know about it so far.</p>

<h2>What is Strawberry/Q*?</h2>

<p>Strawberry is a novel AI approach that aims to push the boundaries of machine reasoning. It first came to public attention during the brief period when Sam Altman was fired from OpenAI in November/December 2022. While initially shrouded in secrecy, Altman has since confirmed that the Q* leak was real.</p>

<p><strong>Key features</strong> of Strawberry/Q* include:</p>

<ul>

<li>Advanced reasoning capabilities</li>

<li>Ability to plan ahead</li>

<li>Autonomous internet navigation</li>

<li>Improved performance on complex science and math questions</li>

</ul>

<p>One of the most exciting aspects of Strawberry is its goal to generate <strong>step-by-step chain of thought reasoning</strong>, not just provide answers. This approach could significantly enhance the AI's ability to explain its thought process and arrive at more accurate conclusions.</p>

<h2>Development and Secrecy</h2>

<p>The development of Strawberry has been a closely guarded secret, even within OpenAI. Our team is creating a "deep research dataset" specifically for training this new model. We're exploring specialized post-training processing techniques to refine its performance in specific ways.</p>

<p>The project aims to enable AI to plan ahead and navigate the internet autonomously. We're essentially working on creating a "computer-using agent" that can conduct research by browsing the web independently and take actions based on its findings.</p>

<h2>Potential Applications and Implications</h2>

<p>The implications of Strawberry's capabilities are far-reaching. We believe it could:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Reduce hallucinations</strong> in AI responses</li>

<li><strong>Improve planning and research</strong> abilities</li>

<li>Enhance <strong>in-context learning</strong></li>

<li>Enable AI to conduct <strong>autonomous web research</strong></li>

</ul>

<p>Perhaps most intriguingly, there's potential for Strawberry to engage in self-improvement, possibly even surpassing human intelligence in certain areas. This prospect is both exciting and, admittedly, a bit daunting.</p>

<h2>Related Concepts: The STAR Method</h2>

<p>Strawberry shares similarities with Stanford's "Self-Reasoner" (STAR) method. STAR allows AI models to bootstrap themselves to higher intelligence through an iterative process:</p>

<ol>

<li>A large language model generates rationales for its answers</li>

<li>The model is fine-tuned on rationales that lead to correct answers</li>

<li>This process repeats, with the improved model generating the next training set</li>

</ol>

<p>This synergistic approach could potentially lead to AI models that surpass human-like intelligence. As Noah Goodman, one of STAR's creators at Stanford, puts it, it's both "exciting and terrifying."</p>

<h2>OpenAI's Stages of AI Progression</h2>

<p>Strawberry fits into our broader vision for AI development. We've outlined three stages of AI progression towards AGI:</p>

<ol>

<li><strong>Chatbots</strong> with conversational language (current public AI)</li>

<li><strong>Reasoners</strong> with human-level problem-solving</li>

<li><strong>Agents</strong> that can take actions (long-horizon tasks, deep research)</li>

</ol>

<p>Strawberry represents a significant step towards stages 2 and 3, aiming to create AI capable of complex reasoning and autonomous action.</p>

<h2>Other Developments: "GPT mini"</h2>

<p>While Strawberry is our main focus, we're also exploring other avenues. Our "GPT mini" project, being tested by LM CIS, could be related to a cost-saving approach where questions are routed to either big or small models based on complexity. This method has shown promise in reducing inference costs while maintaining answer quality.</p>

<h2>Concerns and Speculations</h2>

<p>As with any major advancement in AI, Strawberry raises some concerns. There are warnings about the potential for AI to improve itself, potentially triggering an intelligence explosion. We're carefully considering where and how to apply these new capabilities.</p>

<p>While the potential of Strawberry is immense, it's important to remember that much of what we know is based on reports and rumors. As we continue to develop and refine this technology, we remain committed to responsible AI development and transparent communication about our progress.</p>
