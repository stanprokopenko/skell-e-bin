<p>I've been revisiting my thoughts on <strong>post-labor economics</strong> and how the <strong>post-labor economy</strong> is taking shape as AI and automation advance. Inspired by Grace Blakeley's book <em>Vulture Capitalism</em> and other key economic texts, I've been considering how <strong>neoliberalism</strong>, our current global economic system, is failing us in the face of rapidly evolving technology.</p>

<h2>The Inevitability of AI Replacing Human Labor</h2>

<p>If AI and robots become <strong>better, faster, cheaper, and safer</strong> than humans at economically meaningful activities, it's inevitable they will replace human labor. When creating the cover art for my novel, I found that AI-generated art was not only more cost-effective, it was also preferred by the market over human-made art. Imagine choosing between a human surgeon and a <strong>robot surgeon</strong> who is more precise, affordable, and has a higher success rate, people will naturally prefer the AI option.</p>

<h2>The Failure of Neoliberalism and the Need for a New Model</h2>

<p><strong>Neoliberalism</strong>, emphasizing free-market capitalism, privatization, globalization, fiscal austerity, and individual responsibility, has led us toward a <strong>cyberpunk dystopia</strong> - a high-tech world with a low quality of life for many. As AI devalues human labor, the current social contract based on <strong>private ownership</strong> and <strong>labor rights</strong> collapses. We need a new economic model, as comprehensive and compelling as neoliberalism, to address these challenges.</p>

<h2>Core Tenets of Post-Labor Economics</h2>

<p>I've identified four main principles for <strong>post-labor economics</strong>:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Collective Ownership over Private Ownership</strong>: We should favor collective ownership models, like public land trusts and cooperatives, to distribute resources more equitably.</li>

<li><strong>Decentralization</strong>: Decentralizing power in economic, governmental, and social systems empowers individuals and reduces corporate overreach.</li>

<li><strong>Transparent Governance</strong>: Implementing transparent and accountable government structures, possibly utilizing blockchain technology, can curb corruption and special interest influence.</li>

<li><strong>Consensus-Based Decision Making</strong>: Adopting sophisticated decision-making mechanisms, like decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), aligns with the true values and interests of the people.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Enabling Technologies and Moving Forward</h2>

<p>Technologies like <strong>blockchain</strong>, <strong>AI</strong>, and <strong>DAOs</strong> are essential for implementing post-labor economics. The principle of <strong>subsidiarity</strong>, making decisions at the lowest effective level, can enhance democracy and empower local communities. While challenges exist, such as balancing privacy with transparency and managing the transition carefully, I'm optimistic about building a future where <strong>economic agency</strong> is restored to individuals.</p>
