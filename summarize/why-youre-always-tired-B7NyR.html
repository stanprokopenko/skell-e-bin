<p>High-quality sleep has <strong>changed my life</strong>. There's nothing I do that improves my daily experience more than getting good sleep. I know what it's like to have <strong>really bad sleep</strong>, juggling work, family, and stress. It's miserable. So, here are <strong>six habits that might be wrecking your sleep</strong>, and what you can do about them.</p>

<h2>1. Eating Too Late</h2>

<p>Eating close to bedtime can <strong>disrupt your sleep</strong>. If you eat a heavy meal late at night, your body has to work hard to digest it. This can cause blood glucose spikes and fluctuations, and <strong>disrupt melatonin production</strong>, which throws off your body's preparation for sleep.</p>

<p>I experimented with different meal times to find what worked best for me. I discovered that having my final meal around <strong>11:00 a.m.</strong> helped me sleep better. That might sound extreme, but it allowed my body to complete digestion before bed. I noticed that my <strong>resting heart rate</strong> was a good predictor of sleep quality, when it was lower, I slept better.</p>

<p>Your optimal time might be different, so I encourage you to <strong>experiment</strong> with different meal times. Try finishing your last meal <strong>two, three, or four hours before bed</strong> and see how you feel.</p>

<h2>2. Skipping a Wind-Down Routine</h2>

<p>Not having a wind-down routine can make it hard to <strong>quiet your mind</strong> before bed. If I work right up until I hit the pillow, my mind races with thoughts about the day and things I need to do. To combat this, I establish a clear <strong>transition</strong> to nighttime.</p>

<p>My bedtime is <strong>8:30 p.m.</strong>, so at <strong>7:30 p.m.</strong>, I switch to "nighttime me." I avoid work thoughts and focus on calming activities. I recommend things like <strong>reading a book</strong>, <strong>journaling</strong>, <strong>meditating</strong>, <strong>taking a bath</strong>, or <strong>going for a walk</strong>. Avoid stimulating activities and <strong>screens</strong> during this time.</p>

<h2>3. Late-Day Stimulants</h2>

<p>Having stimulants like <strong>caffeine</strong> too late can <strong>interfere with sleep</strong>. Caffeine has a <strong>half-life of six hours</strong>, so a cup of coffee late in the day can keep you awake at night. I used to consume caffeine and alcohol, but I found that eliminating them improved my mood stability and sleep.</p>

<p>Consider <strong>limiting caffeine</strong> to earlier in the day, and see how it affects your sleep.</p>

<h2>4. Evening Light Exposure</h2>

<p>Light exposure in the evening can disrupt your <strong>circadian rhythm</strong>. In the morning, sunlight is great, but in the evening, you should <strong>dim the lights</strong> and use warm-colored lighting (2700-3500 Kelvin). Avoid <strong>blue light</strong> by using apps like <strong>f.lux</strong> on your screens or wearing <strong>blue light blocking glasses</strong>.</p>

<p>Better yet, try to <strong>eliminate screens entirely</strong> an hour before bed. Instead, engage in relaxing activities that help your body wind down.</p>

<h2>5. Bedroom Temperature</h2>

<p>Your body needs to <strong>cool down</strong> to sleep properly. If your bedroom is too hot or too cold, it can be hard to fall asleep. Simple fixes include <strong>opening a window</strong> or using blinds to control room temperature.</p>

<p>I use a <strong>temperature-controlled mattress</strong> called <strong>Eight Sleep</strong>. It adjusts the bed temperature throughout the night. While such devices can improve sleep, just be mindful when traveling, you may need to adjust your sleep environment away from home.</p>

<h2>6. Noise Disruptions</h2>

<p>Noise can <strong>wake you up</strong> and disrupt your sleep cycles. I had issues with my neighbor's dogs barking at night. I politely asked them to bring the dogs in before my bedtime, and they agreed. Don't be afraid to <strong>communicate</strong> with neighbors about noise issues.</p>

<p>If external noises are unavoidable, consider using a <strong>white noise machine</strong> to mask disruptive sounds.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p>I know it's often considered <strong>heroic</strong> to sacrifice sleep for work or other commitments. But getting <strong>eight hours of quality sleep</strong> is one of the best things you can do for yourself and those around you. Prioritize sleep, and I promise you'll <strong>feel better</strong> and have a better life.</p>
