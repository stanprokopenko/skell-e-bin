<h2>The Leak of Sora</h2>

<p>OpenAI recently released Sora to a select group of artists for early access and testing. One of these artists quickly shared it publicly using Hugging Face, allowing everyone to use it. After just three hours, OpenAI shut down Sora's early access for all artists to address the situation.</p>

<h2>The Artists' Open Letter</h2>

<p>The artists who leaked Sora wrote an open letter to OpenAI and the community. They expressed frustration, feeling like they were being used for unpaid research and development. They stated:</p>

<p><strong>"Artists are not your unpaid R&amp;D. We are not your free bug testers, PR puppets, training data validation tokens."</strong></p>

<p>They released Sora to give everyone a chance to experiment with the tool that only about 300 artists had access to. They emphasized that they are not against using AI technology in art. However, they disagree with how OpenAI's artist program was rolled out and how the tool is shaping up ahead of a possible public release.</p>

<h2>A Call for Openness</h2>

<p>The artists hope OpenAI becomes more open and artist-friendly, supporting the arts beyond PR stunts. They called on artists to use tools beyond proprietary ones. They suggested open-source video generation tools like <strong>Cog Video</strong>, <strong>X-MoChi</strong>, <strong>Latent Video Diffusion</strong>, and <strong>Pyramid Flow</strong>. These tools allow artists to experiment without gatekeeping or serving corporate interests.</p>

<h2>The Current Situation</h2>

<p>Many people are posting leaked videos generated by Sora. It's hard to tell which ones are real. Some links to videos aren't working, possibly because OpenAI took them down. But from what we've seen, Sora is capable of generating some impressive images and videos.</p>

<h2>Closing Thoughts</h2>

<p>This is a developing story. I'll keep you updated as more information becomes available. Let me know what you think, and I'll talk to you soon.</p>
