<h2>YouTube in 2024</h2>

<p>I look at YouTube as <strong>TV, Hollywood, radio, and a music platform rolled into one</strong>.<br />

• The audience is bigger than ever and the algorithm is better than ever.<br />

• Competition is brutal, but a small creator with the <em>right</em> idea, title, and thumbnail can still explode overnight.  </p>

<h2>The Three Non-Negotiables</h2>

<ol>

<li><strong>Idea</strong> – serves the right audience at the right scale.  </li>

<li><strong>Title</strong> – sparks an unavoidable question.  </li>

<li><strong>Thumbnail</strong> – answers “Is this worth my click?” in half a second.  </li>

</ol>

<p>If any one of those three is weak the video stalls, even if the content is beautiful.  </p>

<h3>Click &amp; Watch Platform</h3>

<p>Long-form YouTube is a <strong>decision platform</strong>. TikTok feeds you clips, YouTube asks you to choose. So I front-load time into the things that make people choose.</p>

<h2>Frameworks for Magnetic Ideas</h2>

<h3>CCN Fit</h3>

<p>Patty’s shorthand for an idea that hits the <strong>Core viewer, the Casual viewer, and complete Newcomers</strong> at once. Hard to pull off, but worth aiming for every time.  </p>

<h3>Proven Formats I steal constantly</h3>

<p>• <strong>Comparisons / Versus</strong> – fastest drone vs F1, $1 vs $10 vs $100 golf club, 10 min vs 1 hr vs 24 hr Milky Way photo.<br />

• <strong>Superlatives</strong> – biggest, smallest, fastest, first.<br />

• <strong>Lists</strong> – but only if each item feels fresh: “7 money tips the top 1 % use,” not “7 money tips.”<br />

• <strong>Exclusive Access</strong> – private tour of a secret wildlife sanctuary, backstage at the Oscars, etc.<br />

• <strong>Borrowed Magic</strong> – grab a trick from another niche and show it to an audience that hasn’t seen it yet.  </p>

<p>I keep a running doc of these patterns. If I’m stuck I pick a pattern, fill in my topic, and iterate.  </p>

<h2>Packaging: Small Tweaks, Huge Multipliers</h2>

<p>A client changed one busy thumbnail to a cleaner version, and the video jumped to <strong>40× more views per day</strong>. Another client spent 30 % (not 5 %) of total production time on idea + packaging and leapt from 3 K views to 1 M. Tiny edges snowball because the algorithm widens anything that performs even a hair above average.</p>

<h2>Write More Titles than Feels Reasonable</h2>

<p>I bang out <strong>30+ title options</strong> for every upload. Twenty-nine can be trash. One gem is enough. Slight word swaps count: they teach me why a wording feels flat.  </p>

<h2>The First 30 Seconds Seal the Click</h2>

<p>I devote <strong>20-30 % of editing time to minute one</strong>. Simple structure:  </p>

<ol>

<li><strong>Confirm the click</strong> – show the thing promised in the thumbnail.  </li>

<li><strong>Set the context</strong> – the minimum facts the viewer needs.  </li>

<li><strong>Plant a new hook</strong> – a fresh question that can only be answered by watching to the end.  </li>

</ol>

<p>Viewers decide in seconds whether they “made the right choice.” Reward them immediately or they bail.  </p>

<h2>The 80 % Rule: Engine + Experiments</h2>

<p>• Aim to interest <strong>80 % of your existing audience 80 % of the time</strong>.<br />

• The remaining 20 % of uploads are pure experiments.<br />

Before I hit publish I jot an <strong>expected ranking</strong> (e.g., “probably 8/10”). If the video lands there I don’t panic.  </p>

<h2>Competitive Advantage</h2>

<p>Every channel, brand or creator, needs a clear edge such as access, authority, budget, or a skill no one else can match. I list the edge at the top of every strategy doc, so I never slip into generic ideas.</p>

<h2>Brand Channels: From Dumping Ground to Show</h2>

<p>Most brands still treat YouTube as a <strong>corporate video graveyard</strong>. The fix is to run the channel like a single repeatable show:  </p>

<p>• Red Bull: world-class athletes + stunt concepts = 28 M-view hits.<br />

• Target <em>could</em> run a weekly “Supermarket Sweep” and own the shopping niche.<br />

• An airline <em>could</em> bankroll travel challenges and premiere them in-flight.  </p>

<p>Give the show a clear format, invite creators in, and suddenly the channel drives perception, not just impressions.</p>

<h2>Short-Form vs Long-Form</h2>

<p>Shorts inflate view totals, but long-form still builds deeper brand and revenue. I treat shorts as highlight reels and discovery ads for the big videos.  </p>

<h2>My Quick Checklist Before Upload</h2>

<p><strong>Idea</strong><br />

– Does it hit Core, Casual, New?<br />

– Can I describe it in one irresistible sentence?  </p>

<p><strong>Packaging</strong><br />

– Title under 55 characters, no wasted words.<br />

– Thumbnail readable at 2 cm.<br />

– Have I mocked up at least 5 variations?  </p>

<p><strong>First 30 s</strong><br />

– Visual payoff in first 7 s.<br />

– No fluff context.<br />

– One future promise planted.  </p>

<p><strong>Series Potential</strong><br />

– Could I run this weekly for 52 weeks?<br />

– Does it reinforce my competitive edge?  </p>

<p>If I can tick every box, I hit publish with confidence, whether I’m coaching Red Bull, an astrophotographer, or my own art channel. Everything else on YouTube is noise, those fundamentals are the signal.</p>
