<h2>Understanding AI Tools: LLMs vs. Interfaces</h2>

<p>In this follow-up, I dive into how <strong>Skelly Bot differs from tools like ChatGPT and GPT-4</strong>. It's crucial to distinguish between the <strong>large language model (LLM)</strong> and the <strong>user interface</strong> we use to interact with it. ChatGPT, for instance, is a website interface that lets us engage with models like GPT-4. The interface sends our input to the model, which processes it and returns a response.</p>

<h2>Agents: Expanding AI Functionality</h2>

<p>Beyond basic interactions, we have <strong>agents</strong>, which are LLMs combined with tools. Agents can perform tasks like accessing current weather data or retrieving specific student information to personalize responses. They allow us to expand the AI's capabilities by integrating external data sources and functionalities.</p>

<h2>Autological Tools in Education</h2>

<p>I believe educational tools should be <strong>autological</strong>, they should teach users how they work. It's essential for students to understand the distinction between the models and the interfaces, and how agents operate. Many commercial AI tools hide their workings, creating polished black boxes. In education, we should strive for transparency to empower students with knowledge about the technologies they use.</p>

<h2>Skelly Bot: An Educational AI Assistant</h2>

<p>I've been using <strong>Skelly Bot</strong> in my teaching to explore these concepts. Skelly Bot is integrated with Discord, serving as the user interface. This setup allows students to interact with the AI in a familiar environment. The bot is configured with a hierarchical prompting framework, where system prompts guide the AI's responses within the context of the course material.</p>

<p>One advantage is that we can tune Skelly Bot to use different language models, such as GPT-4 or Claude, or even local models. This flexibility enables students to compare responses and understand the nuances between different models.</p>

<h2>Analyzing Student Interactions</h2>

<p>Using Skelly Bot, we collect rich data from student interactions. This data helps us understand how students engage with the material and the AI. We can analyze conversation topics, identify areas of interest or confusion, and even visualize connections between concepts. This insight informs teaching strategies and supports personalized learning.</p>

<h2>Looking Ahead</h2>

<p>I'm excited about the potential of AI tools like Skelly Bot in education. By building tools that are transparent and customizable, we can enhance learning experiences and help students navigate complex topics. However, we must be cautious not to use AI to grade student work, as this could introduce biases. Instead, AI should be a partner in learning, helping students and educators explore new frontiers.</p>
