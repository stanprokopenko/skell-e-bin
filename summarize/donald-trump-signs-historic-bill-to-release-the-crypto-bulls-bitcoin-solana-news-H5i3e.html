<h2>Executive Order for a US Sovereign Wealth Fund</h2>

<p>President Donald Trump has signed an <strong>executive order</strong> to create the first-ever <strong>U.S. Strategic Sovereign Wealth Fund</strong>. This initiative aims to <strong>monetize the asset side of the U.S. balance sheet</strong> for the benefit of the American people.</p>

<h2>Pro-Bitcoin Leadership</h2>

<p>The fund will be overseen by <strong>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent</strong> and <strong>Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick</strong>, both known for their <strong>pro-Bitcoin</strong> stance. Over the next 12 months, they plan to <strong>fill the fund with various assets</strong>, including liquid assets and equity in U.S. companies.</p>

<h3>Howard Lutnick's Bitcoin Advocacy</h3>

<p>Howard Lutnick has expressed strong support for Bitcoin. He stated, "I have <strong>hundreds of millions of dollars</strong> exposure to Bitcoin, and it will be <strong>billions</strong>." Lutnick believes that as Bitcoin becomes more accepted, its value will increase, and traditional finance will adopt it.</p>

<h2>Potential Inclusion of Digital Assets</h2>

<p>Given the leadership's interest in cryptocurrencies, there is speculation that the fund may include not just Bitcoin but also other digital assets like <strong>XRP, Solana, Ethereum</strong>, and other high-cap altcoins.</p>

<h2>Solana ETF Developments</h2>

<p>Breaking news indicates that several firms, including <strong>VanEck</strong>, <strong>Galaxy Digital</strong>, <strong>Bitwise</strong>, and <strong>21Shares</strong>, have <strong>refiled their Solana ETF applications</strong> with the SEC. This mirrors the behavior observed before the approval of the first Bitcoin ETFs, suggesting a higher probability that a <strong>Solana ETF</strong> may be approved soon.</p>

<h2>Impact of Tariffs on Crypto Markets</h2>

<p>Recent <strong>tariffs imposed by President Trump</strong> have caused a downturn in the crypto markets. Bitcoin experienced a <strong>15% drop</strong>, with altcoins affected even more significantly. While tariffs create short-term market uncertainty, they also lead to <strong>inflation</strong>, which historically benefits Bitcoin.</p>

<h2>Pause on Mexican Tariffs</h2>

<p>There has been a temporary pause on tariffs against Mexico after discussions between President Trump and the Mexican president. Mexico agreed to take measures to reduce drug trafficking to the U.S., providing some relief to the markets.</p>

<h2>Upcoming Press Conference on Digital Assets</h2>

<p>Trump's crypto advisor, <strong>David Sachs</strong>, is scheduled to hold a press conference to discuss strategies for securing America's leadership in the digital asset ecosystem. Further details are expected soon.</p>
