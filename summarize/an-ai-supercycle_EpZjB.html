<p>I started today's briefing with a narrative about Wall Street's confusion over AI. On one hand, there are growing questions about whether AI is priced appropriately or if it's overhyped. All summer, we've discussed whether AI is overvalued in the market. I've mentioned that the upcoming rate-cutting cycle might provide an alternative narrative.</p>

<p><strong>The Debate Over an AI Supercycle</strong></p>

<p>Amid this confusion, there's a counterpoint arguing that an <strong>AI supercycle</strong> is coming.</p>

<p><strong>Media Perspectives on the AI Supercycle</strong></p>

<p>For example, the New York Post published an article titled "Apple launches AI-powered iPhone 16 but Wall Street split on whether it will spark a supercycle." The article focuses on whether <strong>Apple Intelligence</strong> can help boost sluggish iPhone sales. The larger question is how significant Apple Intelligence will be and what it says about users adopting AI tools.</p>

<p><strong>Industry Leaders on the AI Supercycle</strong></p>

<p>Interestingly, that wasn't the only time I saw the term "supercycle" yesterday. AMD CEO <strong>Lisa Su</strong>, who isn't exactly unbiased, suggested that the AI supercycle is just beginning. Su told Yahoo Finance, "We've accelerated our AI roadmap and are on a one-year cadence of new products. <strong>It is an AI supercycle.</strong>" What exactly "supercycle" means is up for interpretation. Presumably, it refers to financial performance, market results, and business prioritization.</p>

<p>I recall the last time someone called for a supercycle in Web3, it didn't go well for them or the industry. I find it amusing because we're having two very different conversations at the same time. On one hand, there's the discussion about AI's relationship to markets and whether it's overhyped. On the other hand, there's the unstoppable transformation of professional and personal experiences by AI.</p>

<p>I think it's important to separate these two things when discussing whether AI is in a supercycle. In short, when it comes to our actual lives, <strong>of course it is.</strong> The question is whether the markets will agree the whole time.</p>

<p><strong>Oracle's Positive Momentum in AI</strong></p>

<p>Speaking of markets, <strong>Oracle</strong> is getting some positive coverage for its AI approach. The Wall Street Journal noted that mistakes Oracle made at the start of cloud computing are now helping it with AI. They wrote that Oracle's long-stagnant stock is up 34% thanks to its neutral status in the booming AI computing power market. Last night, the company reported better-than-expected results. They also announced partnerships with <strong>Amazon</strong> and <strong>Google</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Significance of Oracle's Partnerships</strong></p>

<p>Analyst <strong>Patrick Moorhead</strong> said that Oracle is "on a roll" and that its partnership with Amazon Web Services is monumental. He noted that "these two companies have essentially been at war with each other since AWS was formed 15 years ago." Yahoo Finance wrote that the Oracle partnership shows that the Oracle database is alive and well. Enterprise customers are demanding it.</p>

<p><strong>Oracle's Data Strategy in AI</strong></p>

<p>Moorhead explained why Oracle's on-premise rather than cloud approach to data could be valuable in the AI world. As AI becomes more of a priority, <strong>data will be the company's biggest play.</strong> He said, "The biggest obstruction from enterprises going hardcore into AI is the AI problem. It's getting the data right, comingling the right data to give generative AI the right solutions without leaking confidential information." For the customers he talked about, "Oracle is the place to go." He suggested that they will be the <strong>data broker for the generative AI age.</strong></p>

<p><strong>TSMC's Revenue Growth as an AI Indicator</strong></p>

<p>Another AI-related company performing well is <strong>TSMC</strong>. Their revenue was up 33% last month. Bloomberg called it a positive signal for investors betting on a smartphone market recovery and sustained demand for NVIDIA's AI chips. They wrote that while just a month's snapshot, the results could assuage concerns about overestimating the durability of AI infrastructure spending. TSMC now makes more than half of its revenue from its AI-driven business line.</p>

<p><strong>Developments in AI Voice Avatars</strong></p>

<p>I came across a couple of stories about AI voice avatars.</p>

<p><strong>Audible's Initiative with Narrators</strong></p>

<p><strong>Audible</strong> is inviting a group of US-based narrators to train AI on their voices. The idea is to add more audiobooks to Audible quickly and cheaply, involving existing narrators. This follows an initiative last year where Amazon offered US-based self-publishing authors the option of having their works narrated by a generic virtual voice. As of May, more than 40,000 books had taken advantage of that. This new arrangement aims to increase the quality of such work.</p>

<p>The company said this beta offering will empower participants to expand their production capabilities for high-quality audiobooks. It will allow them to generate new business by taking on more projects simultaneously and increase their earning potential. Payments will be made on a title-by-title basis through a royalty-sharing model. This will let narrators have their voice associated with certain projects.</p>

<p><strong>Ethical Considerations and Future Implications</strong></p>

<p>On the flip side, I have to think that what they'll make from an AI version of their voice will be different than traditional earnings. The big question in the long term is whether there will continue to be a market for original voice acting or if it will all move to AI.</p>

<p><strong>James Earl Jones and the AI Rights to Darth Vader's Voice</strong></p>

<p>Another story on AI voice rights caught my attention. Vanity Fair reports that before he died, <strong>James Earl Jones</strong> signed over the AI voice rights to Darth Vader. Jones died on Monday morning at the age of 93. He was famous for numerous roles, especially anchored by his voice as Darth Vader in the Star Wars trilogy.</p>

<p>In 2022, Jones, then 91, signed over the rights to his archival voice work to a Ukrainian startup called <strong>Respeecher</strong>. As with everything in AI right now, this is a Rorschach test. Is this an affront to the way things should be, or does it mean that future generations will get to enjoy new renderings of Darth Vader's perfect voice even if the original isn't there to do it? It's a topic open for discussion, but for now, that's it for the headlines.</p>
