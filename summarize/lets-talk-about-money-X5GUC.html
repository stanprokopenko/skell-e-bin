<p>In 2019, we committed to raising <strong>$25 million</strong> to build a maternal and infant care center in the Kono District of Sierra Leone, which then had the world's highest rate of maternal mortality. Building a hospital is complex and requires ongoing funding for costs like hiring community health workers to identify at-risk pregnancies.</p>

<p>Thousands of people donate monthly at p.org, supported by a matching fund. This provides the financial backbone for the maternal and infant care project. However, we needed additional funding sources, and Hank had the idea to support it through selling socks.</p>

<h2>Fundraising Through Socks</h2>

<p>Initially, I was skeptical about selling socks, but I was wrong. This year alone, the socks have raised over <strong>$759,000</strong> for maternal and child healthcare. Although this is down from last year, partly because people canceled subscriptions when their sock drawers filled up and because TikTok stopped subsidizing advertising, the response has been incredible.</p>

<h2>Soap and Shampoo Bars</h2>

<p>We also produce <strong>Sun Basin Soap</strong> and shampoo bars, which have netted <strong>$882,000</strong> this year. The soap has a devoted following, and most customers remain loyal. People use a lot of soap, so this support continues to grow.</p>

<h2>Coffee and Tea</h2>

<p>Our coffee, rebranded as <strong>Keats and Co.</strong>, has over <strong>10,000 subscribers</strong> and has raised over <strong>$580,000</strong> so far this year. Since launching tea in August, it has raised over <strong>$60,000</strong>. Proceeds from coffee and tea support a new project fighting tuberculosis in <strong>Lesotho</strong>, which has the highest TB incidence in the world. We aim to show that investing in tuberculosis can dramatically reduce rates.</p>

<h2>Total Donations and Impact</h2>

<p>So far in 2024, our total donations from these ventures are just over <strong>$1.25 million</strong>. Since we started, we've raised almost <strong>$9 million</strong> to support stronger healthcare systems in impoverished communities. In a world where global health funding is flat or declining, this makes a real difference.</p>

<h2>Gratitude and Encouragement</h2>

<p>I am encouraged by how these initiatives are making an impact. Thank you, Hank, for these ideas, and thanks to everyone who has supported us by purchasing socks, soap, coffee, and tea. Your support is invaluable, and I continue to love being part of this journey.</p>
