<p>I began by discussing Kamala Harris, and I find myself ending on the same note. But this time, I'm doing something different, I'm defending her. There are many valid reasons to criticize Kamala, she's often seen as incompetent, unfit for office, and morally corrupt. But in the spirit of fairness, I believe she doesn't get enough credit for her eloquence.</p>

<h2>The Viral Interview</h2>

<p>Recently, Kamala sat down for an interview with <strong>60 Minutes</strong>. During the conversation, she was asked about the situation in the Middle East. Her response has gone viral, with many claiming she delivered a confusing "word salad." Critics suggest her answer was incoherent, even by her standards.</p>

<h2>Breaking Down Her Statement</h2>

<p>Let's look at what she actually said:</p>

<p><em>"The work that we have done has resulted in a number of movements in that region by Israel that were very much prompted by or result of many things including our advocacy for what needs to happen in the region."</em></p>

<p>Yes, it's a long sentence, about 40 words without punctuation. But let's dissect it.</p>

<h3>The Work We Have Done</h3>

<p>She begins by acknowledging <strong>the work that we have done</strong>. This refers to the efforts and activities undertaken to achieve certain results in the region.</p>

<h3>Resulted in Movements</h3>

<p>She notes this work, <strong>has resulted in a number of movements</strong>. Movements signify changes or progress, undeniable in the current Middle East context.</p>

<h3>Prompted By or Result of Many Things</h3>

<p>She continues, stating these movements were <strong>very much prompted by or result of many things</strong>. This admits the complexity of international relations, where multiple factors influence outcomes.</p>

<h3>Including Our Advocacy</h3>

<p>Finally, she adds <strong>including our advocacy for what needs to happen in the region</strong>. Here, she emphasizes their role in promoting necessary actions.</p>

<h2>Understanding Her Message</h2>

<p>Critics may mock her phrasing, but when broken down, her statement is coherent. She's highlighting:</p>

<ul>

<li>The efforts made by her administration.</li>

<li>The resulting changes in the region.</li>

<li>The myriad factors influencing these changes.</li>

<li>Their advocacy for necessary developments.</li>

</ul>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p>It's easy to dismiss her words as gibberish, but perhaps we're being unfair. By listening carefully, we can perceive the substance in her message. Maybe if we heeded her insights, progress could be made. That's why, in this case, it's the critics who should reconsider their stance.</p>
