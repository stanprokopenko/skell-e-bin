<h2>Background on Ryan's ToysReview</h2>

<p>Three years ago, I highlighted the <strong>questionable practices</strong> behind Ryan's ToysReview. Despite significant attention, <strong>little has changed</strong>. Lately, discussions have emerged about whether <strong>Ryan is essentially a slave</strong> to his channel.</p>

<h2>The Kaji Family and Their Empire</h2>

<p>Ryan Kaji, now 13, started on YouTube at age three. His parents, Shion and Loann, <strong>orchestrate the channel</strong>, with his twin sisters now featured prominently. From 2018 to 2020, they were the <strong>highest-paid YouTubers</strong>, earning more than anyone else. They own <strong>multiple mansions</strong> and indulge in <strong>extravagant vacations</strong>.</p>

<h2>Concerns Over Ryan's Well-being</h2>

<p>Despite their wealth, the family continues to produce content. Ryan often looks <strong>unhappy</strong>, and his parents <strong>control his interviews</strong>, ensuring he doesn't speak freely. There's a sense that he's <strong>pressured</strong> to maintain the channel's success for their gain.</p>

<h2>Advertising Controversies</h2>

<p>In 2017, authorities found that the channel didn't properly disclose <strong>paid promotions</strong> in a way children could understand. Although they promised to comply, issues persisted, leading to a complaint with the <strong>Federal Trade Commission</strong> in 2019.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p>It's time for the family to prioritize <strong>Ryan's well-being over profits</strong>. They've amassed enough wealth to retire comfortably. Letting Ryan live a normal life could prevent future resentment and allow him to <strong>enjoy his childhood</strong>.</p>
