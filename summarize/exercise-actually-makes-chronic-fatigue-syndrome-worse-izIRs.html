<h2>What Is ME/CFS?</h2>

<p>Myalgic encephalomyelitis, also known as chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS), is a <strong>neurological disease</strong> that goes far beyond feeling tired after a sleepless night. It's characterized by <strong>extreme fatigue</strong> that doesn't improve with rest and can worsen with physical or mental activity.</p>

<h2>Symptoms and Impact</h2>

<p>ME/CFS affects an estimated <strong>15-30 million people worldwide</strong>, yet <strong>around 90% remain undiagnosed</strong>. Symptoms can drastically alter daily life:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Unrefreshing sleep</strong>: No amount of sleep leaves us feeling rested.</li>

<li><strong>Post-exertional malaise (PEM)</strong>: A significant worsening of symptoms after physical or mental exertion, often delayed by 24 hours.</li>

<li><strong>Cognitive dysfunction</strong>: Difficulty with concentration and memory.</li>

<li><strong>Orthostatic intolerance</strong>: Lightheadedness when standing up.</li>

</ul>

<p>Up to <strong>75% of people with ME/CFS are unable to work</strong>, and some are confined to their beds.</p>

<h2>Why Exercise Isn't the Answer</h2>

<p>Contrary to common advice, <strong>exercise can make ME/CFS symptoms worse</strong>. Those of us with ME/CFS experience <strong>drops in blood oxygen levels and heart rate after exertion</strong>. Graded exercise therapy, which involves gradually increasing activity, has been found to be harmful.</p>

<h2>Causes and Triggers</h2>

<p>ME/CFS often develops after an infection. Viruses like the <strong>Epstein-Barr virus</strong> (which causes mono) and <strong>SARS-CoV-2</strong> (the virus behind COVID-19) have been linked to triggering the condition. In fact, studies suggest that <strong>half of those with long COVID meet the criteria for ME/CFS</strong>.</p>

<h2>The Challenge of Diagnosis</h2>

<p>Diagnosing ME/CFS requires experiencing specific symptoms for at least <strong>six months</strong>. This includes extreme fatigue, PEM, cognitive issues, and orthostatic intolerance. The delayed onset of PEM makes it difficult to identify triggers, turning management into detective work.</p>

<h2>Managing ME/CFS</h2>

<p>While there's no cure, symptom management strategies include:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Activity pacing</strong>: Adjusting our activities to match energy levels and avoid overexertion.</li>

<li><strong>Symptom tracking</strong>: Keeping a daily log to identify triggers and limits.</li>

<li><strong>Medication</strong>: Using pain relievers or sleep aids as prescribed to ease symptoms.</li>

<li><strong>Planning rest</strong>: Resting before and after significant activities to minimize PEM.</li>

</ul>

<h2>The Importance of Patient-Centered Research</h2>

<p>There's a pressing need for more research that prioritizes patient experiences. Controversial studies like the PACE trial, which incorrectly promoted increased exercise, highlight the dangers of disregarding patient feedback.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p>For those without ME/CFS, exercise remains a valuable part of a healthy lifestyle. But for people with ME/CFS, pushing beyond limits isn't beneficial and can be harmful. Recognizing and respecting these differences is crucial for support and understanding.</p>
