<h2>Introducing Myself and My Work</h2>

<p>I'm Jonathan Samir Maddis, a professor of neuroscience at Northeastern University and founder of the <strong>FreeMoCap Foundation</strong>. We focus on making high-tech tools accessible in education, science, and art through free, open-source projects.</p>

<h2>Developing AI-Powered Tools</h2>

<p>I've been developing and using AI-powered tools like <strong>Skelly Bot</strong>, an AI chatbot named after our mascot. Skelly Bot assists in research and teaching, harnessing AI's transformative potential to reshape education and mentorship.</p>

<h2>Challenges in Traditional Teaching</h2>

<p>Teaching complex, interdisciplinary topics is tough. Students often lack the diverse background needed to grasp all aspects. Traditionally, I'd have to narrow the content or go broad but shallow, which isn't ideal.</p>

<h2>Using Skelly Bot in My Classes</h2>

<p>To address this, I use Skelly Bot in a <strong>Discord server</strong> structured around my course topics. The bot provides <strong>individualized, AI-assisted mentorship</strong>, simulating one-on-one teaching. Students interact with Skelly Bot to explore subjects they're interested in, guided by <strong>hierarchical prompting</strong> that keeps conversations on track.</p>

<h2>Benefits of AI-Assisted Learning</h2>

<p>This approach lets students <strong>navigate complex material at their own pace</strong>, diving deeper into areas they find intriguing. It allows me to teach at a higher level, knowing the bot can help students with concepts they might not initially grasp. Students carve their own paths through the material, fostering a more engaging and personalized learning experience.</p>

<h2>Looking Ahead</h2>

<p>I plan to enhance this method by integrating <strong>lecture transcriptions and outlines</strong> into the bot, further enriching student interactions. While we're in the early days of this technology, I'm optimistic about AI's potential to <strong>transform education</strong>, making sophisticated topics accessible to more students.</p>
