<p>In this second part of our simplifying from observation project, we're focusing on portraits. The goal is to simplify shapes, values, and edges into their bare essentials, using just five values, one edge, and shapes built from blocky structures.</p>

<p>Let's dive into a student's work and explore some key concepts.</p>

<h2>Initial Observations</h2>

<p>Looking at this portrait, I noticed a few interesting things. The darkest shadows are really dominant, but there's not much clarity in the light areas. Usually, when the light values are too close together, it's because the shadows aren't dark enough. But here, the shadows are very dark, yet the lights are still extremely light. This creates a big contrast, but it also makes the two areas look separate instead of part of one cohesive volume.</p>

<h2>The Importance of Half-Tones</h2>

<p>What's missing here are the darker half-tones that tie the shadows and lights together. Let me show you how adding just a few can make a big difference.</p>

<p>You've got some dark half-tones in a few areas, like the lips, but they're missing from large portions of the face. By adding transitional planes from shadow to light, especially around the eye socket and underneath the brow ridge, we can create a more unified look.</p>

<h2>Rethinking Value Organization</h2>

<p>Interestingly, you've combined the dark half-tone and the lighter shadow value. This actually gives us more room to describe the planes in the lights, which is cool. It's a valid solution to organize values this way - we're essentially saying the shadow information isn't as important, and we want the viewer to focus on the lit areas.</p>

<p>Now we have four values for the lights, giving us more range to work with. What would typically be the shadow of the face is now our darkest half-tone.</p>

<h2>The Egg Effect in Portraits</h2>

<p>To improve this portrait, we need to capture what I call the "egg effect" of a head. Think of the head as an egg shape - bigger on top, more pointy at the chin. When light hits this egg shape from an angle, the lightest spot is typically on the upper part. Everything moving away from this lightest spot gets progressively darker.</p>

<p>In a portrait, this means the forehead and cheek will be lighter than the jaw. Let me quickly block this in to show you.</p>

<p>By adding a soft gradation of half-tones at the bottom of the face, we create a much rounder, more three-dimensional look. In your portrait, you've brought the light all the way down to the jaw next to the shadow, which loses that slightly downward-facing plane we see in the reference photo.</p>

<h2>Implementing the Egg Effect</h2>

<p>To apply this concept:</p>

<ol>

<li>Clarify what's actually in shadow in the eye socket.</li>

<li>Use darker half-tones for the bottom plane of the jaw and transitional areas.</li>

<li>Gradually lighten the values as we move up the face.</li>

<li>Keep the lightest values for the most prominent areas facing the light source.</li>

</ol>

<p>By doing this, we unite the shadows and lights, creating a more cohesive, three-dimensional form.</p>

<h2>Avoiding Common Mistakes</h2>

<p>One thing that often throws people off is <strong>tunnel vision</strong>. You might work on one area, comparing values only within that small section, instead of looking at the whole picture. This can lead to fragmented value relationships across the portrait.</p>

<p>Remember, this exercise is designed to help you simplify everything down to just five values. It makes it easier to manage and compare across the whole picture. You can say, "Value 3 here looks just like Value 3 over there," and group them together.</p>

<h2>The Power of Simplification</h2>

<p>This simplification exercise is great for keeping everything in check while still getting a good read of the bigger forms. It helps you think about your values in a more manageable, organized way.</p>

<p>By limiting yourself to five values, you're forced to really consider how each area relates to the whole. It's a powerful tool for improving your understanding of value relationships and creating more cohesive, three-dimensional portraits.</p>

<p>Remember, the key is to always compare values across the entire picture, not just within small areas. This will help you maintain consistency and create a more unified, realistic portrait.</p>

<p>Keep practicing, and you'll see your portraits improve dramatically!</p>
