<p>I've spent 15 years learning what I'm about to share with you in just a few minutes. It's a simple framework that changed my life and work forever: <strong>The Rule of 300</strong>. This rule has helped me create my dream life, and I believe it can do the same for you.</p>

<h2>100% Clarity</h2>

<p>The crazy thing I've realized is that most people can't tell you what they want. When I ask entrepreneurs about their dreams and goals, they often struggle to articulate them. But when you're clear about what you want, it allows others to help you.</p>

<p>For example, Gary Vaynerchuk tells everyone he wants to buy the New York Jets. Elon Musk talks about colonizing Mars every chance he gets. Their clarity activates support from others. We don't create our future, we <strong>attract</strong> it.</p>

<h3>How to Find Clarity</h3>

<p><strong>Dream Big:</strong> If I could go back and talk to my younger self, I'd say, "Dream bigger." We underestimate what's possible when we focus and compound our efforts over time. Start with a one-year goal, but also build five-year and even 55-year plans. I have a business plan for the next 55 years because I know I'll wake up every day and create.</p>

<p><strong>Shop Your Dreams:</strong> Get around the energy of your dreams. Visit your dream house, sit in your dream car, or spend time in places that inspire you. When one of my team members wanted a Porsche, I took him to the dealership. He sat in the car and got familiar with it. By making your dreams feel normal, you bring them closer to reality.</p>

<p><strong>Write Them Down:</strong> You're more likely to achieve goals that are written down. I have a note on my phone called "12 Power Goals," which I review three to four times a day. Keeping your goals front and center makes success inevitable.</p>

<p><strong>Create a Vision Board:</strong> Our brains think in pictures. By creating a vision board, you engage your reticular activating system, which helps you notice opportunities that align with your goals. Visualizing what you want makes it easier to achieve.</p>

<h2>100% Belief</h2>

<p>Your beliefs either support your vision or hold you back.</p>

<h3>Overcoming Limiting Beliefs</h3>

<p>Limiting beliefs about your skills or possibilities can hinder you. Thoughts like "I'm not smart enough" or "It takes money to make money" keep you from achieving your goals. You'll never hold onto what you don't think you deserve.</p>

<h3>Eliminating Negative Beliefs</h3>

<p>Negative beliefs about the world, such as thinking it's a bad place, cause you to play small. If you think the world is negative, you'll always find negativity. Instead, focus on the positive aspects to attract positive outcomes.</p>

<h3>Embracing Positive Beliefs</h3>

<p>Act as if you've already achieved your goals. Speak about them as if they're already accomplished. Conor McGregor often talked about his achievements before they happened. Everything that exists was first seen in someone's mind. Believe it's possible for you.</p>

<h2>100% of the Time</h2>

<p>To build momentum, you need to maintain clarity and belief all the time. Momentum isn't about perfect days, it's about showing up on imperfect ones.</p>

<h3>Design Your Environment</h3>

<p>I design my environment to default to success. I set out my workout clothes the night before and surround myself with people closer to my goals. Curate your space to win.</p>

<h3>Manage Your Energy</h3>

<p>We can't manage time, but we can manage our energy. High-energy, positive people achieve more. What you eat and how you exercise affect your energy levels.</p>

<h3>Build Your Achievement List</h3>

<p>When you feel down, make a list of your achievements, no matter how small. Reminding yourself of past successes boosts your confidence and energy. I review my list to remind me of what I've accomplished, which helps me overcome doubt.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p><strong>The Rule of 300</strong> will make your success inevitable. By maintaining <strong>100% Clarity</strong>, <strong>100% Belief</strong>, <strong>100% of the Time</strong>, you can make your goals a reality. Show up with clarity and belief, and you'll attract the future you desire.</p>
