<h2>My Core Push</h2>

<p>I see three connected goals:  </p>

<ol>

<li><strong>Accelerate interpretability research</strong> so we can spot most serious model problems by 2027.  </li>

<li><strong>Shape policy with light-touch transparency rules and strong export controls</strong> to buy safety time.  </li>

<li><strong>Stay balanced</strong>, avoid both extreme AI doom and reckless acceleration while welcoming open critique.</li>

</ol>

<p>Everything here is my opinion. I invite anyone to find weak links in my logic.  </p>

<h2>Why Interpretability Must Move Faster</h2>

<p>Right now is a perfect moment to jump in. Anthropic and other labs have opened many research paths at once, and they are even investing in startups that focus on interpretability and alignment. I keep asking Google DeepMind, OpenAI, and every big player to pour more resources into this work.  </p>

<p>The payoff could be huge. We already map millions of internal concepts that looked invisible a year ago. Anthropic’s latest papers isolate neurons and circuits tied to dangerous features. OpenAI shows that punishing “bad thoughts” teaches models to hide them, so we must understand thoughts, not suppress them.  </p>

<p>If we crack neural networks, we might also help neuroscience. Overlapping principles may guide both silicon and biology. Grasping one system should give clues about the other.  </p>

<h2>Light-Touch Rules, Heavy Transparency</h2>

<p>The field is young. Over-regulation could freeze discovery before we know what works. Some recent EU rules feel heavy-handed and premature. Governments move slow, AI moves fast, and real-time lawmaking is tricky. Even experts cannot yet name every safety requirement that future laws should hold.</p>

<p>What we can do now is force <strong>public disclosure of safety and security practices</strong>. Open publication lets everyone learn and sparks a race to the top. Firms that act responsibly earn public goodwill and investor trust. The California Frontier Model Task Force response might grow into a national or global template.  </p>

<h2>Export Controls as a Safety Buffer</h2>

<p>I back strong export controls on advanced chips to China. Export limits slow unsafe progress and create a security cushion. If the U.S. and China hit powerful AI at the same time, world risk jumps. A clear democratic lead buys extra time to invest in safety.  </p>

<h2>Holding a Balanced View</h2>

<p>I reject both “AI doom tomorrow” and “floor-it acceleration.” Capability growth is a red car racing ahead. Safety work is a green car that still lags but moves forward. My stance sits in the middle. I value Dario Amodei’s step-by-step reasoning even when I disagree. Pinpoint exactly where his chain breaks, and we all learn.  </p>

<p>The SVIC podcast with Dr. Mike Israel sees the same two extremes with reality in between. Their “kook watch” playlist only lists me once. That made my day.  </p>

<h2>Next Steps and Calls to Action</h2>

<p>I plan to read more Anthropic work on features and circuits because it links AI alignment with human cognition. I also want suggestions for under-covered research that deserves a closer look.  </p>

<p><strong>Bottom line:</strong> speed up interpretability, keep transparency light but firm, and hold the export-control line. Do that, and we improve our odds of reaching safe AI in time.</p>
