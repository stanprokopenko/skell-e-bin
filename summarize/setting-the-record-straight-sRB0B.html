<p>I've been a dad for a year and a half now, and I want to share my experiences and thoughts on parenthood. People often ask me questions about being a dad, so I thought I'd answer some of them here.</p>

<h2>Raising a Multilingual Child</h2>

<p>Many have asked if it will be challenging for my son, B, to learn multiple languages. As parents who speak different languages, we plan to each speak our native tongue to him. I'll speak Swedish, and my wife, Marzia, will speak Italian. He'll likely pick up English from us as well. Hopefully, he'll also learn Japanese while we're in Japan.</p>

<h2>Managing Tech Usage</h2>

<p>Questions about <strong>"iPad kids"</strong> and controlling tech usage are common. It's fascinating how children are drawn to screens. While I spend a lot of time on screens myself, it feels different when I see my child doing it. We try to limit his screen time and avoid using it as a substitute for engagement. If we're at a restaurant and need a few minutes, we might use it, but overall, we encourage him to play with toys and engage in activities.</p>

<h2>Thoughts on Children's Content</h2>

<p>I get asked if I let B watch shows like <strong>Cocomelon</strong>. The answer is no. I find the animation to be of poor quality, and there are many other productive and better options for kids to watch. If he does watch something, I'd prefer it to be more enriching.</p>

<h2>Sharing Hobbies</h2>

<p>Will I teach B how to play <strong>Minecraft</strong>? Absolutely! I can't wait to share games with him. However, I believe in teaching balance. It's important to enjoy various activities and not spend all day on video games.</p>

<h2>Watching My Child Grow</h2>

<p>The coolest thing B has done recently is learning how to <strong>high-five</strong>. Seeing him develop from being completely dependent to starting to use utensils and communicating is incredible. Even small things, like imitating me blowing air, amaze me. It's wonderful to witness his growth and be proud of his accomplishments.</p>

<h2>Balancing Family and Future</h2>

<p>People often ask where I see myself in <strong>5 to 10 years</strong>. Honestly, I've struggled with this question, especially now that I have a child. I've felt anxiety over planning ahead, but I've realized it's okay not to have everything figured out. For now, Japan is a wonderful place for us, and we're happy here.</p>

<h2>Impact on Our Relationship</h2>

<p>Having a child has definitely changed my relationship with Marzia. The initial phase was challenging, we felt like roommates due to our new routines and lack of sleep. But as B grows, we're sharing more experiences and we have become a family. It's an amazing journey, we're on together.</p>

<h2>Parenting Reflections</h2>

<p>One piece of advice I have for new parents is not to stress over others' opinions. Do what feels right for you and your child. Also, I've learned that people often forget the details of raising a child as time passes, so recent experiences are more valuable.</p>

<p>Growing up, my parents were <strong>understanding and patient</strong>. I hope to continue that with B. For instance, when I got into trouble as a kid, my dad would sit down and talk with me instead of getting angry. I want to adopt a similar approach, being patient but also setting boundaries when necessary.</p>

<h2>Experiencing Life Anew</h2>

<p>Before having B, I didn't think much about becoming a dad. But now, my perspective has completely changed. I feel a renewed sense of <strong>purpose and excitement</strong>, experiencing life again through his eyes. It's hard work, but it's incredibly rewarding.</p>
