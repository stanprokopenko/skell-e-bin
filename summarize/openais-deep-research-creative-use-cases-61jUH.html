<h2>Testing OpenAI's Deep Research</h2>

<p>OpenAI has been active lately, so I tested their latest offering: Deep Research. Similar to Google's Gemini but powered by the 03 model, it's designed for in-depth analysis. I wanted to see its creative potential.</p>

<p>Despite its $200/month price tag, I tried it out and packaged the reports for you to explore.</p>

<h2>Comparing AI Video Generators</h2>

<p>I asked Deep Research: <strong>What's the best AI video generator for quality and cost?</strong> It generated a detailed report after clarifying questions.</p>

<h3>Findings</h3>

<ul>

<li><strong>Minimax</strong>: Produces 720p videos with vibrant colors but limited control.</li>

<li><strong>CLLING</strong>: Excellent prompt adherence, occasional glitches, slightly less polished than Runway.</li>

<li><strong>Runway</strong>: Fast generation, robust editing tools, but inconsistent prompt control.</li>

<li><strong>Sora</strong>: Promising but struggles with realism and complex actions, not ideal for budgets.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>Deep Research found <strong>CLLING</strong> offers the best quality-to-price ratio, with Runway close behind. Kudos to OpenAI for unbiased results.</p>

<h2>Subscriptions vs. Local Setup</h2>

<p>I also analyzed whether subscriptions or building a local machine is more cost-effective.</p>

<h3>Costs</h3>

<ul>

<li><strong>Subscriptions</strong>: Around <strong>$3,100/year</strong></li>

<li><strong>Local Machine</strong>:<ul>

<li>Hardware: <strong>$3,300</strong></li>

<li>Training: <strong>$2,000</strong></li>

<li>Electricity: <strong>$350/year</strong></li>

</ul>

</li>

</ul>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>Initially, a local machine costs more but becomes cost-effective over time. Most of us use a hybrid approach.</p>

<h2>ByteDance's Omnimatte-1</h2>

<p>ByteDance released Omnimatte-1, an impressive AI lip-sync tool supporting audio and video driving. The results are amazing, but the code isn't available yet.</p>

<h2>Matte-Anything: AI Rotoscoping</h2>

<p>Matte-Anything offers the best AI rotoscoping I've seen, effortlessly handling tricky elements like hair. The code releases next week, and I'm eager to try it.</p>

<h2>Visit to Adobe HQ</h2>

<p>I attended Adobe's Gen AI Leadership Summit. Expecting a sales pitch, I was pleased they genuinely wanted honest feedback, and we provided it. Adobe listened openly, which was refreshing.</p>

<h2>The ComfyUI Event</h2>

<p>Afterward, I joined the ComfyUI event at GitHub. Hearing from Comfy himself and seeing innovative uses was inspiring, showcasing the diversity in our community.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p>These experiences highlight that in the evolving AI landscape, there's room for everyone. Our voices collectively shape the future.</p>
