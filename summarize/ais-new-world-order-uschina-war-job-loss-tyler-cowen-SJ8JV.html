<h2>Openness vs. Closeness in Technological Innovation</h2>

<p>I recently had the chance to discuss with <strong>Tyler Cowen</strong> the implications of <strong>AI</strong> on innovation and global relations. We dove into the debate between <strong>openness and closeness</strong> in technological development.</p>

<p>Tyler argued that <strong>openness</strong> tends to be more beneficial in the long run. He pointed out that <strong>America's great innovations</strong> might have been delayed without its earlier period of <strong>espionage</strong>. He emphasized that we're not good at being <strong>closed</strong>, but we're pretty good at <strong>openness</strong>.</p>

<p>For example, attempts to keep the secrets of the <strong>atomic bomb</strong> didn't prevent them from leaking to the <strong>Soviet Union</strong>. In contrast, openness allows for shared progress and can prevent adversaries from developing independent systems that might surpass ours.</p>

<h2>The Case of <strong>China</strong> and <strong>AI Development</strong></h2>

<p>We discussed how the <strong>U.S. ban on AI chips to China</strong> might have <strong>backfired</strong>. By restricting China's access to high-end chips, we pushed them to innovate alternative methods. This led to the development of <strong>deep seek</strong>, a Chinese AI model approaching the performance of U.S. models but trained at a fraction of the cost.</p>

<p>Tyler suggested that policies intended to hinder competitors can actually spur them to innovate in unexpected ways. He questioned whether it's better for China to be part of the same <strong>hardware network</strong> or to fully develop its own independent network.</p>

<h2>Imitation as a Path to <strong>Innovation</strong></h2>

<p>We explored the idea that <strong>imitation</strong> can be a necessary first step toward genuine <strong>innovation</strong>. Drawing from a quote by <strong>René Girard</strong>, we noted how countries or cultures often start as imitators before becoming innovators. The <strong>U.S.</strong> itself engaged in <strong>economic espionage</strong> in its early days, with figures like <strong>Alexander Hamilton</strong> advocating for stealing technology from Europe.</p>

<p>Tyler cautioned against oversimplifying this process. He argued that <strong>copying</strong> and <strong>innovation</strong> are not opposites but part of a <strong>dialectic</strong>. Being open to innovation from unexpected places is crucial.</p>

<h2>The Impact of <strong>AI</strong> on the <strong>Future of Work</strong></h2>

<p>Tyler believes that <strong>AI</strong> will radically transform the workforce. It will split the population into two groups: a small portion able to use the technology effectively, and the rest who may be left behind. Those who can collaborate with <strong>AI</strong> will leapfrog ahead in various fields.</p>

<p>He suggested that many jobs will involve working alongside <strong>AI</strong>. People skilled at operating <strong>AI</strong> will become far more productive. Professions requiring physical labor or creativity, areas where <strong>AI</strong> hasn't yet fully penetrated, may see increased value.</p>

<h2>Preparing for an <strong>AI-Dominated</strong> World</h2>

<p>Tyler emphasized the importance of familiarizing ourselves with <strong>AI</strong>. He advised spending time using the best <strong>AI systems</strong> available to understand their capabilities and limitations. This hands-on experience is crucial for adjusting to the changes <strong>AI</strong> will bring.</p>

<p>He also pointed out that people in the <strong>humanities</strong> could benefit greatly from <strong>AI</strong>. While <strong>AI</strong> may outperform humans in certain technical tasks, human creativity and emotional intelligence remain vital.</p>

<h2>The Role of <strong>AI</strong> in <strong>Content Creation</strong></h2>

<p>We talked about how <strong>AI</strong> is changing the landscape of writing and content creation. As <strong>AI models</strong> get better at generating text, writers need to adapt. Tyler mentioned that injecting <strong>personality</strong> and <strong>originality</strong> into our work becomes even more important to stand out.</p>

<p>He noted that <strong>AI</strong> could serve as a collaborator, helping to generate ideas or draft content. However, it's essential to maintain our unique human perspective to remain relevant.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p>Living in rapidly changing times can be challenging. Tyler encourages us to <strong>embrace</strong> the changes that <strong>AI</strong> brings and to remain <strong>curious</strong>. By staying <strong>adaptable</strong> and <strong>engaged</strong>, we can navigate the uncertainties of a future shaped by <strong>artificial intelligence</strong>.</p>
