<p>Today, I want to discuss how <strong>Y Combinator</strong> envisions the future of <strong>AI and agents</strong> based on their recently released <strong>Request for Startups (RFS)</strong> for Spring 2025. As many of you know, Y Combinator is the most renowned startup accelerator in the world. Periodically, they release an RFS to highlight key themes and problems they'd like entrepreneurs to tackle. This serves as a glimpse into the future they foresee.</p>

<p>In their latest update, of the <strong>14 startup ideas</strong>, <strong>13 are AI-related</strong>, and <strong>8 involve agents</strong>. Let's dive into how they've categorized these ideas and what they imply for the future.</p>

<h2>AI and Agent Infrastructure</h2>

<p>The largest category in the RFS is <strong>AI and agent infrastructure</strong>. Y Combinator recognizes that AI and agents are rapidly advancing and that we'll need robust infrastructure to support this growth.</p>

<h3>Data Centers and Compute Resources</h3>

<p>We will require more <strong>data centers</strong>, increased <strong>power infrastructure</strong>, better <strong>cooling systems</strong>, and efficient <strong>material procurement</strong>. Building out this infrastructure is crucial for the next generation of AI applications.</p>

<h3>Dev Tools for AI Agents</h3>

<p>They're interested in <strong>development tools</strong> that make agents better. This includes companies that enable customers to easily <strong>create and deploy custom agents</strong> and provide <strong>agent building blocks</strong> like tools, APIs, and platforms to enhance agent capabilities.</p>

<h3>Browser and Computer Automation</h3>

<p>By giving agents more access to <strong>browsers and computer automation</strong>, we can <strong>10x the addressable use cases</strong> for AI agents. This opens up a vast array of possibilities for automation and efficiency.</p>

<h3>Inference AI Infrastructure</h3>

<p>As we shift from focusing on pre-training to applying compute at <strong>inference time</strong>, we'll need better <strong>software at the inference layer</strong>, <strong>cost-effective GPU workloads</strong>, and <strong>optimizations</strong>. This addresses the increasing infrastructure costs associated with AI applications.</p>

<h3>AI Commercial Open Source Software</h3>

<p>Many enterprises will build custom AI deployments on top of <strong>open-source software</strong>. There's a need for companies that provide support similar to closed-source vendors but for <strong>enterprise open-source AI deployments</strong>.</p>

<h3>B2A Software: Business to Agents</h3>

<p>One of the most intriguing ideas is <strong>B2A software</strong>, where the customers are <strong>agents</strong> rather than humans. As agents begin to make purchasing decisions, there's an opportunity to build services that specifically cater to them.</p>

<h2>Agent Applications</h2>

<p>Y Combinator sees vast potential in <strong>agent applications</strong> that can revolutionize various industries.</p>

<h3>Vertical AI Agents</h3>

<p>They're excited about <strong>vertical AI agents</strong>, software built on top of LLMs that's finely tuned to automate significant tasks in specific industries. This opportunity is so substantial that they believe it could create <strong>another 100 unicorns</strong>.</p>

<h3>AI Personal Staff for Everyone</h3>

<p>By leveraging agents, services that were once only accessible to the wealthy, like <strong>personal lawyers</strong>, <strong>money managers</strong>, <strong>personal trainers</strong>, and <strong>private tutors</strong>, can now be made available to everyone.</p>

<h3>The Future of Software Engineering</h3>

<p>Perhaps the most fascinating is their vision for <strong>software engineering</strong>. Language models can now write code better than most humans, bringing the <strong>cost of building software down to zero</strong>.</p>

<h4>Managing Teams of Agent Developers</h4>

<p>While agents will handle coding and specialized tasks like <strong>QA</strong>, <strong>deployment</strong>, <strong>security</strong>, and <strong>compliance audits</strong>, we'll still need <strong>human software engineers</strong>. Their role will shift to managing teams of agents. Y Combinator wants to fund startups that enable small groups of generalist developers to manage large teams of agents working together to build and ship substantial software.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p>It's clear that Y Combinator anticipates a future where agents play a central role in both infrastructure and applications. The pattern of humans managing armies of agents won't be limited to software engineering but will extend across various domains.</p>

<p>I hope this gives you some insights into how one influential Silicon Valley institution sees the future of AI and agents. It's an exciting time, and there are countless opportunities for those looking to build the next big thing.</p>
