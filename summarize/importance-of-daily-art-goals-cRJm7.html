<p>Hey everyone! I'm Josh Black, a senior concept artist at Stoke Games. I often get asked by aspiring artists what they can do daily to improve their skills. I wanted to share my own <strong>five daily art goals</strong> that have helped me grow as an artist. I keep these as bullet points on a document, checking them off as I go. It's a great way to stay accountable and track progress.</p>

<h2>My Five Daily Art Goals</h2>

<h3>One Painting a Day</h3>

<p>I aim to do <strong>one painting every day</strong>. It can be a quick study, anywhere from 30 minutes to a couple of hours. The goal is to become more comfortable with <strong>color</strong>, <strong>value</strong>, and different <strong>surface types</strong>. For example, I enjoy painting portraits because faces are fascinating to me. Whether it's a quick study or a longer piece, the key is to <strong>learn</strong> and <strong>improve</strong> at your own pace.</p>

<h3>A Page of Anatomy Studies</h3>

<p>Every day, I dedicate time to <strong>anatomy studies</strong>. I focus on a specific part of the body, like back muscles, legs, or arms, and fill a page with sketches. This helps deepen my understanding of how the body is structured. For instance, I might study the posterior chain one day, and the arm muscles the next.</p>

<h3>A Page of Figure Drawings</h3>

<p>I try to do a page of <strong>figure drawings</strong>, often starting with quick <strong>gestures</strong>. When time allows, I'll dive into longer, more sustained poses. These exercises enhance my ability to capture movement and understand human proportions. Sometimes, I'll combine this with my painting practice, sketching and painting on the same page.</p>

<h3>Master Copies</h3>

<p>Doing <strong>master copies</strong> is a fantastic way to learn from artists you admire. While traditional masters like John Singer Sargent are great, I also recommend copying contemporary <strong>stylized artists</strong> if you're into animation or concept art. For example, I've studied work by Cheeks Galloway, analyzing how he simplifies forms and designs shapes. This practice helps me incorporate new techniques into my own style.</p>

<h3>Imagination Sketches</h3>

<p>Lastly, I spend time on <strong>imagination sketches</strong>, drawing entirely from my head. This is where I apply what I've learned from the day's studies, anatomy, gesture, design, and see what I can create. It's a great way to <strong>test yourself</strong> and synthesize new ideas. Don't be too harsh on yourself during this process, it's all about growth.</p>

<h2>Additional Practice: Learning 3D with Blender</h2>

<p>Recently, I've added a new goal: spending <strong>half an hour on Blender tutorials</strong> each day. Exploring different mediums like 3D modeling can broaden your skill set, especially if you're interested in concept art for video games or film. Learning tools like Blender can help you <strong>iterate faster</strong> and bring your ideas to life in new ways.</p>

<h2>Staying Motivated and Tracking Progress</h2>

<p>Having these bullet point tasks and <strong>checking them off</strong> gives me a sense of accomplishment. It feels good to know that I've taken steps toward becoming the artist I want to be. Remember, consistency is key. Doing these exercises daily will significantly improve your skills over time.</p>

<p>Don't worry about producing perfect work or getting lots of likes on social media. Focus on <strong>learning</strong> and <strong>getting better</strong>. After a few months, you'll see progress, and that's the most rewarding part.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p>I hope sharing my daily art exercises gives you some structure to follow in your own practice. Consider creating your own list of goals to check off each day. It's a satisfying way to stay on track and measure your growth.</p>

<p>Thanks for tuning in! I'm planning to post more regularly, so I hope to see you next week. Keep drawing and pushing your creative boundaries!</p>
