<h2>Betting the Company on GPT-4</h2>

<p>Jake Heller, CEO of <strong>CaseText</strong>, saw the potential of GPT-4 before its public release. Upon accessing an early version, he decided within 48 hours to pivot the entire 120-person company. We shifted all focus to building <strong>CoCounsel</strong>, an AI legal assistant based on GPT-4, aiming to leap ahead of the market.</p>

<h2>From Incremental Improvements to a Paradigm Shift</h2>

<p>For ten years, CaseText made incremental advancements in legal technology. We invested in natural language processing and machine learning, but lawyers often ignored these small changes. The release of <strong>ChatGPT</strong> changed everything. Lawyers realized AI would fundamentally alter their work, increasing demand for innovative solutions.</p>

<h2>Building CoCounsel: Overcoming Challenges</h2>

<p>Jake led by example, building the first version of CoCounsel himself. Despite internal skepticism, we dedicated ourselves to creating an AI assistant capable of tasks like reviewing millions of documents and conducting detailed legal research. We broke down legal tasks into step-by-step processes, using test-driven development to ensure accuracy.</p>

<h2>Ensuring Accuracy and Trust</h2>

<p>Accuracy was crucial. Lawyers needed reliable results to trust the technology. We employed rigorous testing, creating prompts that guided the AI to produce precise and consistent outputs. By moving from <strong>70% to 100% accuracy</strong>, we made CoCounsel suitable for mission-critical applications.</p>

<h2>The Impact on the Legal Industry</h2>

<p>CoCounsel's success demonstrated how AI can transform legal practice. By automating tedious tasks, lawyers can focus on strategic thinking. Our approach showed that with careful engineering, large language models can be harnessed effectively, even in fields demanding high precision.</p>

<h2>Looking Ahead: The Future of Vertical AI Agents</h2>

<p>Jake's experience illustrates the potential of vertical AI agents. As AI models like GPT-4 advance, industries can leverage them to create specialized tools. We believe this marks the beginning of a significant shift, and we're excited to see how AI will continue to revolutionize professional fields.</p>
