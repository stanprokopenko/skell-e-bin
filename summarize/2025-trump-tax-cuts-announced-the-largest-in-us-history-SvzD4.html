<h2>Eliminating Taxes on Tips, Social Security, and Overtime</h2>

<p>I understand that Trump's plan includes removing taxes on <strong>tips</strong>, benefiting over 4 million workers like bartenders and servers. By eliminating taxes on <strong>Social Security benefits</strong>, retirees and disabled workers can keep more of their income. Removing taxes on <strong>overtime pay</strong> would help over 10 million workers retain more of their hard-earned money.</p>

<h2>Extending and Adjusting Existing Tax Cuts</h2>

<p>The <strong>2017 tax cuts</strong> are set to expire in 2025, which would raise tax rates and reduce deductions. Extending these cuts, including lower tax brackets and the increased standard deduction, is crucial to prevent tax hikes. Adjusting the <strong>SALT cap</strong>, currently at $10,000, would benefit taxpayers in high-tax states who lost significant deductions.</p>

<h2>Incentivizing Made in America Products</h2>

<p>By lowering the corporate tax rate to as low as 15% for companies that manufacture in the U.S., we aim to boost domestic production and encourage businesses to keep operations in America.</p>

<h2>Closing Tax Loopholes</h2>

<p>Trump plans to close the <strong>carried interest loophole</strong>, affecting hedge funds and private equity firms, so their profits are taxed as ordinary income. He also intends to eliminate <strong>tax breaks for billionaire sports team owners</strong> who currently benefit from significant write-offs on intangible assets.</p>
