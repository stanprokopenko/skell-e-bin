<h2>From AI Automation to Agentic OS</h2>

<p>Over the past few years, we've witnessed the evolution of AI agents. Initially, <strong>Agents V1</strong> were simple AI automation tools, like inbox managers, content generators, and report creators. They handled straightforward, single use tasks.</p>

<p>Then came <strong>Agents V2</strong>, which I liken to vertical agents. Inspired by the vertical SaaS model, these agents catered to specific industries or functions, much like software solutions built for niche markets.</p>

<p>Now, we're entering the era of <strong>Agents V3: Agentic Operating Systems</strong>. This is where things get exciting. We're moving beyond isolated agents to systems that can operate autonomously within a data sandbox, accessing real-time contextual data and the tools they need to function effectively.</p>

<h2>What Is an Agentic Operating System?</h2>

<p>An <strong>agentic operating system</strong> is an AI system that operates within a data sandbox, with full access to real-time contextual data and necessary tools. It functions <strong>reliably, effectively, and autonomously</strong>, planning and executing tasks without constant human intervention.</p>

<p>The missing piece so far has been the <strong>UI/UX</strong> - how we interact with these agentic systems. We need interfaces that make working with agents intuitive and seamless, much like how <strong>Jarvis</strong> assists Tony Stark in the movies.</p>

<h2>The Final Form: Personal AI Assistants</h2>

<p>In their ultimate form, agentic operating systems will be <strong>Jarvis-like personal AIs</strong>. These agents will:</p>

<ul>

<li>Be trained on your personal data within your secure sandbox</li>

<li>Connect to a network of agents, tools, functions, and data</li>

<li>Serve as extensions of ourselves, enhancing productivity and capabilities</li>

</ul>

<p>Businesses will have their own centralized agentic operating systems, accessing proprietary data and workflows, and connecting to employees' personal agents.</p>

<h2>Smartphones as Early Agentic Systems</h2>

<p>Our smartphones already act as early versions of agentic systems. They provide real-time contextual data, serve as communication channels, and store personal information. We, as humans, are the AI interpreting and acting on this data. The next step is transferring this agency to <strong>LLMs with agentic capabilities</strong>.</p>

<h2>What LLMs Need to Become Truly Agentic</h2>

<p>For LLMs to operate as true agentic systems, they need:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Real-time contextual data</strong></li>

<li><strong>Tools to execute actions and workflows</strong></li>

<li><strong>Memory storage and core knowledge</strong></li>

<li><strong>Feedback mechanisms</strong> for continuous improvement</li>

</ul>

<p>The only missing element is <strong>purpose</strong>, which we provide through prompts.</p>

<h2>How Do We Get There?</h2>

<p>To build these agentic systems, we need:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>End-to-end integration</strong> with our systems</li>

<li><strong>Standardized data pipeline structures</strong></li>

<li><strong>Robust prompt engineering</strong></li>

<li><strong>Simple and seamless orchestration</strong> of agents</li>

</ul>

<p>Nice-to-haves include better LLMs and potentially a new internet-like protocol specifically for agents.</p>

<h2>What We Can Do Today</h2>

<p>We've started building these systems using our <strong>super agent architecture</strong>. This allows us to:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Scale via natural language</strong> - the difference between agents lies in their prompts</li>

<li>Achieve <strong>full end-to-end data sync</strong>, creating a data sandbox for the agent</li>

<li>Utilize <strong>comprehensive tooling</strong> for seamless integration</li>

</ul>

<h2>Example: Building "Mallorie," Our Executive Agent</h2>

<p>We've developed an executive agent named <strong>Mallorie</strong>. She has access to:</p>

<ul>

<li>An <strong>agentic CRM</strong> and <strong>agentic database</strong></li>

<li>Sub-agents acting as tools for calendar, email, and Slack actions</li>

</ul>

<p>We manage her through a modular system where we add prompts (which we call playbooks) to define her capabilities. For example, Mallorie can:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Coordinate and schedule meetings</strong></li>

<li><strong>Draft follow-up emails</strong> after sales calls</li>

<li>Provide <strong>general assistance</strong> via Slack</li>

</ul>

<p>We use tools like <strong>n8n</strong> and <strong>Airtable</strong> to build and track her activities.</p>

<h2>The Importance of UI/UX</h2>

<p>The key challenge is creating a <strong>UI/UX that works with agentic systems</strong>. We need ways to interact with agents that feel natural, providing observability and control without hindering their autonomous capabilities.</p>

<h2>Moving Forward</h2>

<p>We're excited about the potential of agentic operating systems. The ability to go from idea to execution rapidly, with agents handling complex tasks autonomously, is transformative.</p>

<p>We're also building a community and resources to share our knowledge and help others build their own agents. The future is here, and we're eager to be part of shaping it.</p>
