<p>Who doesn't want to live forever? Well, perhaps not everyone, as forever is... well... forever. But whether it's for your health or vanity, you probably wouldn't say "no" to a longer life without the side effects that come with getting older. If you're searching for ways to stay young, you may have stumbled upon a new kind of anti-aging supplement based on a molecule called <strong>nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide</strong>, or <strong>NAD⁺</strong> for short.</p>

<p>While you shouldn't spend your life's savings on the stuff, it turns out that science might be onto something here. Might.</p>

<h2>The Aging Process</h2>

<p>Your body ages because it accumulates <strong>cellular damage</strong> over time. This damage can come from a variety of sources. Some are external factors, like UV radiation and pollution. Others are internal, like the genetic errors that slowly build up as your cells copy their DNA over and over to make more of themselves.</p>

<p>Over time, your cells can begin to malfunction, or they simply die without replicating, leaving no replacements. So aging is a gradual decline in function. With it comes a higher risk of age-related illnesses like heart disease, cancer, and neurodegenerative disorders.</p>

<p>Modern medicine has gotten better at treating many of these diseases, but it hasn't worked out how to stop aging in the first place. At least not yet. This is where <strong>NAD⁺ enters the conversation</strong>.</p>

<h2>What Is NAD⁺?</h2>

<p>Your body is constantly making NAD⁺ throughout your life. NAD⁺ is what scientists call a <strong>coenzyme</strong>, a molecule that helps enzymes do their jobs in the cell. This particular coenzyme supports several essential functions in every cell of your body.</p>

<p>NAD⁺ plays a major part in <strong>DNA repair</strong>, <strong>inflammation reduction</strong>, and keeping your <strong>mitochondria</strong> working properly. But as you get older, the amount of NAD⁺ in your body drops. It's a totally natural process, but this decline contributes to the cellular damage and breakdown we see as aging.</p>

<h2>NAD⁺ and Aging</h2>

<p>Scientists have a hypothesis: boosting your NAD⁺ levels could be the key to combating the aging process. And like all good scientists, they've been testing that hypothesis.</p>

<p>Some researchers have focused on supplements that don't specifically contain NAD⁺, but instead contain one of two smaller molecules that your body can turn into NAD⁺. Their names are both mouthfuls, so we'll just call them <strong>NR</strong> and <strong>NMN</strong>. NAD⁺ itself is a lot harder for your body to absorb, it has to be injected directly into your bloodstream, but the precursor molecules can be taken in pill form.</p>

<p>So even if literally no one on the planet was afraid of needles, those pills would be a much cheaper anti-aging intervention, assuming the research proves the hypothesis correct.</p>

<h2>Research on NAD⁺ Supplements</h2>

<h3>Studies in Animals</h3>

<p>The results of these supplements have been promising... at least if you're a lab animal. In one paper from 2013, a team of scientists gave some geriatric mice daily doses of NMN for one week, and the mice wound up showing <strong>better muscle function</strong>.</p>

<p>Researchers have also carried out studies on tiny worms called <strong><em>C. elegans</em></strong>. Testing on worms might sound a bit pointless, but these little creatures are actually pretty similar to us, biologically speaking. We share many of the same genes and bodily processes, so scientists use them as simplified versions of the human body to see what side effects certain drugs might have on us, both positive and negative.</p>

<p>Increasing NAD⁺ levels in <em>C. elegans</em> worms, either by giving them those precursor supplements or by genetically engineering them to maintain higher NAD⁺ levels in their bodies, appears to <strong>extend their life</strong> and delay certain age-related declines.</p>

<p>But, despite all their similarities, mice and worms are not humans. So the big question remains: does this promising research translate to us?</p>

<h3>Studies in Humans</h3>

<p>So far, the results in human trials have been encouraging, but limited. One study in middle-aged and older adults showed that taking NR supplements <strong>increased NAD⁺ levels</strong> without any significant side effects, and might have some potential for treating heart disease.</p>

<p>Another trial, which used NMN instead, was in postmenopausal women with pre-diabetes. The women who took the supplement had <strong>better insulin sensitivity</strong> in their muscles compared to women who took a placebo.</p>

<p>Back in 2022, a research team published a big analysis that looked at multiple studies to see what we could learn from all of these findings put together. They found that the supplements <strong>may help manage your cholesterol</strong>. Our cholesterol levels can get harder to manage as we age, although that's mostly because of how our lifestyles change as we age, not the aging itself.</p>

<p>Either way, we have to say "may" because the decrease they found wasn't statistically significant. But in more positive news, it appeared that increasing NAD⁺ can <strong>reduce certain chemical signals associated with inflammation</strong>. That's good because chronic inflammation is linked to a wide range of diseases and health issues.</p>

<h2>Limitations and Considerations</h2>

<p>While these studies show that boosting NAD⁺ in your aging body can do you some good, they fall short of the life-extension promises seen in worms. The reality is that we're still in the early days of understanding the full impact of boosting NAD⁺ levels in humans.</p>

<h2>The Wellness Industry and NAD⁺</h2>

<p>Of course, that hasn't stopped the wellness industry from enthusiastically embracing NAD⁺ as an anti-aging miracle. You can wander down the aisle of your local drug store and pick up a bottle of non-FDA regulated NAD⁺ precursor right now. Or if you've got even more money to burn, you could do what some celebrities do and get hooked up to a <strong>NAD⁺ IV drip</strong>.</p>

<p>Luxury wellness centers currently offer NAD⁺ infusion treatments that'll set you back <strong>hundreds of dollars per session</strong>! But boosting NAD⁺ certainly isn't the magic bullet some companies are claiming it to be.</p>

<h2>Maximizing Your Healthspan</h2>

<p>Whether or not NAD⁺ turns out to be our best bet against aging, what can you do to stave off the inevitable march of time? Instead of trying to expand your <strong>natural lifespan</strong>, you can try using well-established, if unglamorous techniques to maximize your <strong>healthspan</strong> - the number of years you live in good health, free from chronic disease.</p>

<p>And yes, I mean the boring stuff, like <strong>eating a healthy diet</strong>, <strong>exercising regularly</strong>, <strong>not smoking</strong>, and so forth. Maybe just focus on the basics before splurging on NAD⁺ products.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p>Boosting NAD⁺ may not be the magic bullet for aging that some hope it to be. But maybe, just maybe, we've found a fancier way to help us live longer, if not forever.</p>
