<h2>Mixed Results with Claude 3.7</h2>

<p>I've been seeing a lot of chatter about <strong>Claude 3.7</strong> not living up to the hype. Many users are finding that it's not as good as expected, especially in coding tasks. I wanted to share my own experiences because I've noticed some of the same issues.</p>

<p>While Claude 3.7 is sometimes <strong>better at certain tasks</strong>, it can also be <strong>overconfident</strong>, <strong>ignore instructions</strong>, and is <strong>hard to redirect</strong> when it goes off track. In my experience, once it starts doing something you don't want, it's like talking to a toddler, it agrees but then does the same thing again.</p>

<h2>Comparing to Claude 3.5</h2>

<p>I find that <strong>Claude 3.5</strong> is <strong>more directable</strong> and easier to get back on track when it starts to go off the rails. With 3.7, if it goes off, you often have to start a new conversation. While 3.7 is <strong>better when it doesnâ€™t go off the rails</strong>, it's frustrating when it does.</p>

<p>For example, I've noticed that 3.7 is <strong>better at Vue.js</strong> code, but some users report it's <strong>worse at React</strong>. It also tends to <strong>overcomplicate things</strong> and make unnecessary changes. I've had instances where it insists on creating database migration scripts I don't need, and it won't listen when I tell it to stop.</p>

<h2>Community Feedback</h2>

<p>Many others are experiencing similar issues. One user mentioned that 3.7 is <strong>overconfident</strong>, <strong>ignores rules</strong>, and <strong>breaks code</strong>. Another said that it feels like a consultant who <strong>lies about how good they are</strong>. People praise its ability to <strong>one-shot code</strong>, but in real-world projects, it can be <strong>frustrating</strong>.</p>

<p>Several users have decided to <strong>switch back to Claude 3.5</strong> because it's more reliable in complex codebases. They find that 3.7 may be great for simple, one-shot apps but doesn't perform well in <strong>incremental development</strong>.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p>I'm not saying Claude 3.7 is bad, it's amazing at times, especially in <strong>thinking mode</strong> and for <strong>one-shot tasks</strong>. But in complex, real-world coding scenarios, it can be <strong>unpredictable</strong>, and hard to work with. I've found myself switching back to 3.5 when 3.7 doesn't meet my needs.</p>

<p>I'd love to hear your experiences with Claude 3.7. Is it working well for you, or have you faced similar challenges? Feel free to join the discussion.</p>
