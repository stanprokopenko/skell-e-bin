<p>As an AI expert at Proko, I've been closely following the latest developments in the field. OpenAI is set to release their new "strawberry" model as part of the ChatGPT service within the next two weeks. This release has generated a lot of buzz in the AI community, and I'm excited to share what we know so far.</p>

<h2>What is the "Strawberry" Model?</h2>

<p>The exact implementation of the "strawberry" model is still unclear. It might be a standalone feature or integrated into the existing ChatGPT interface. What we do know is that it's designed to <strong>improve reasoning, multi-step planning, and thinking through answers</strong>.</p>

<p>One of the key features of this model is its <strong>"thinking time"</strong>. Unlike current AI models that respond almost instantly, the "strawberry" model will take about 10-20 seconds to process before giving an answer. This delay is intentional and is meant to allow for more complex reasoning.</p>

<p>The model may use an invisible "scratch pad" to work through problems, similar to how humans might jot down notes or diagrams when solving complex issues. This approach could potentially lead to <strong>significant improvements in performance on tasks like math, coding, and even subjective areas like business strategy</strong>.</p>

<h2>Potential Impact and Expectations</h2>

<p>The "strawberry" model aligns with OpenAI's vision of creating AI that can work independently in the background. It could enable more "agentic" behavior, where AI completes tasks autonomously. This is an exciting prospect, as it could open up new possibilities for AI applications in various fields.</p>

<p>However, there are conflicting reports about the model's capabilities. Some early testers claim it demonstrates human-level reasoning, while others suggest the improvements are more marginal. It's worth noting that this release might be a "quantized" or reduced version of the full strawberry model.</p>

<h2>Industry and Public Perception</h2>

<p>OpenAI is widely perceived as a leader in AI technology, and there's a lot riding on this release. Investments in AI are partly driven by the hype surrounding OpenAI, and there are rumors of powerful, hidden technologies in development.</p>

<p>However, there's also a growing sense of skepticism. Public sentiment is starting to shift, with more people questioning the AI hype. If the "strawberry" model doesn't live up to expectations, it could potentially dampen enthusiasm and investment in AI.</p>

<p>Adding to the uncertainty, several employees have recently left OpenAI. Given the company's position in the field, this has raised some concerns in the AI community.</p>

<h2>Looking to the Future</h2>

<p>Even if AI development were to plateau now, we'd still see significant applications and effects. However, the real excitement is around potential 10x or 100x improvements in AI capabilities.</p>

<p>Information from OpenAI's Japan office suggests that the next model could have 100x the "effective compute" of the previous one. This pattern of 100x improvement has been seen before, from GPT-2 to GPT-3, and from GPT-3 to GPT-4.</p>

<p>The big question is: will we see a huge leap in AI capabilities in the next 6 months to a year, or will the changes be more incremental?</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p>The release of OpenAI's "strawberry" model is highly anticipated, with a full release expected by September 24th at the latest. While its exact capabilities remain to be seen, it represents an interesting shift towards AI models that prioritize deeper reasoning and planning.</p>

<p>As we wait for the release, it's important to maintain a balanced perspective. While the potential for significant advancements is exciting, we should also be prepared for the possibility of more gradual improvements.</p>

<p>What are your thoughts on these developments? Are you excited about the potential of AI models with improved reasoning capabilities? Or do you think the hype might be outpacing the reality? Let me know in the comments below!</p>
