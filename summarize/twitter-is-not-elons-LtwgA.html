<h2>Twitter vs. X: What's in a Name?</h2>

<p>In April 2022, Elon Musk decided to buy <strong>Twitter</strong>. By July 23, 2023, Twitter officially became <strong>X</strong>. Yet, many of us continue to use the term <strong>Twitter</strong> and refer to posts as <strong>tweets</strong>. I understand that companies can rebrand, but I feel that the community should have a say in what we call the spaces we inhabit online.</p>

<p>If someone moved into my town and declared it now called <strong>X</strong>, I'd resist. I'd still call it <strong>Missoula</strong> because it's <strong>my community</strong>. Similarly, just because the company behind Twitter has rebranded doesn't mean we have to abandon the names we've always used.</p>

<h2>Tweets Are Universal</h2>

<p>I believe that a <strong>tweet</strong> isn't just a post on Twitter, it's any text post on a many-to-all microblogging platform. Whether it's <strong>Blue Sky</strong>, <strong>Mastodon</strong>, <strong>Threads</strong>, or any other platform, these posts are <strong>tweets</strong>. Using a generic term like <strong>posts</strong> is less specific, and it diminishes the uniqueness of these platforms.</p>

<p>Other platforms have tried to coin their own terms, <strong>toots</strong> on Mastodon, <strong>skeets</strong> on Blue Sky, but these often don't resonate. We've already got a perfectly good word in <strong>tweet</strong>, and there's no need to reinvent the wheel.</p>

<h2>Social Platforms as Communities</h2>

<p>These platforms are more than just apps, they're <strong>communities</strong> where we spend significant parts of our lives. I feel like a citizen of the internet as much as I'm a citizen of Montana. Just as a town isn't defined solely by its government, a platform isn't just its company, it's the people who use it.</p>

<p>The companies that run these platforms are like <strong>governments</strong>, setting policies and maintaining infrastructure. But they don't own the community's identity. The name and culture are shaped by the users.</p>

<h2>The Role of Journalists and Language</h2>

<p>I urge journalists and writers to consider this perspective. Referring to Twitter as <strong>X</strong> feels inaccurate because it ignores the community's role in defining the platform's identity. Language evolves based on common usage, and the widespread continued use of <strong>Twitter</strong> and <strong>tweets</strong> reflects that.</p>

<p>Even Elon Musk sometimes slips and calls it Twitter, or refers to posts as tweets. This inconsistency highlights how ingrained these terms are. Changing what we call these platforms and posts isn't just about rebranding, it's about recognizing the lived experiences of their users.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p>In essence, <strong>Twitter</strong> is more than a brand, it's a shared space shaped by all of us. Let's continue to call it what it truly is, honoring the community we have built together.</p>
