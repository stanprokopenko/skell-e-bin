<h2>Increasing Global Threats</h2>

<p>The world has become a vastly more dangerous place with the rise of <strong>nuclear weapons</strong> and <strong>hypersonic missiles</strong>. Hypersonic missiles travel at speeds many times the speed of sound, up to six times faster than current missiles. Armed with nuclear warheads, they have the potential to annihilate entire cities or even countries within minutes.</p>

<h2>The Rising Nuclear Discourse</h2>

<p>The term <strong>nuclear</strong> is now being mentioned more frequently on the global stage. During previous administrations, this word was rarely used. However, other countries are now using it against us because they perceive a lack of respect for our leadership. The potential for a global conflict, possibly a <strong>World War III</strong>, looms as a catastrophe unlike any other.</p>

<h2>The Need for Unmatched Defense</h2>

<p>To ensure such a conflict never happens, we must be prepared with unmatched technology and unrivaled strength. Building a <strong>state-of-the-art, next-generation missile defense shield</strong> is paramount. Just as Israel is protected by the <strong>Iron Dome</strong>, America must develop an impenetrable shield to protect our people.</p>

<h2>Lessons from the Iron Dome</h2>

<p>We collaborated with Israel to develop their Iron Dome. They relied heavily on our technology, which remains unsurpassed. However, our past leaders have been hesitant to utilize our full capabilities. It's time to take the next step in defense.</p>

<h2>Protecting Our Homeland</h2>

<p>We must be able to defend our homeland, allies, and military assets around the world from the threat of hypersonic missiles, regardless of where they are launched from. Our adversaries must understand that they, not the United States, will face total destruction if they ever dare to launch missiles against us.</p>

<h2>The Role of the Space Force</h2>

<p>The <strong>Space Force</strong>, inaugurated under previous leadership, will play a vital role in this defense strategy. It was a significant achievement, marking the first new military branch in 79 years. Strengthening our <strong>nuclear capabilities</strong> and missile defense systems will help us achieve <strong>peace through strength</strong>.</p>

<h2>Concerns Over Current Policies</h2>

<p>There is growing concern that current policies are escalating global tensions, particularly with the ongoing conflict involving Ukraine. The provision of long-range missiles and increased military support may be prolonging the conflict and edging us closer to a larger war.</p>

<h2>The Importance of Prioritizing Peace</h2>

<p>We believe that focusing on diplomatic solutions and de-escalation is crucial. The loss of lives in conflicts abroad is a significant issue that should take precedence over less critical matters. It's essential to be aware of the global impact of our policies and actions.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p>Addressing the increasing threats of nuclear weapons and hypersonic missiles is of utmost importance. By investing in advanced defense systems and prioritizing diplomatic solutions, we can strive to ensure the safety and security of our nation and work towards a more peaceful world.</p>
