<h2>What Is Composition?</h2>

<p>Hi, my name is Bill Perkins, and today I want to talk about composition. <strong>Composition</strong> is your <strong>visual statement</strong>. It's how you express your ideas and feelings through images. People often ask if composition is instinctual or if there are rules to follow. I believe it's about becoming more <strong>visually literate</strong>. That means understanding the components that make up an image and how to use them effectively.</p>

<h2>Visual Literacy and Its Importance</h2>

<p>Being an artist doesn't automatically make you visually literate. <strong>Visual literacy</strong> is about communicating your ideas clearly through imagery. To do that, you need to understand the language of art. This language isn't about strict rules but about how you use visual elements to express yourself.</p>

<h2>The Role of Patterns and Value Systems</h2>

<p>From the moment we're born, we start building a <strong>visual vocabulary</strong>. We recognize faces, understand friendly and unfriendly expressions, and learn to see <strong>patterns</strong>. Recognizing patterns is fundamental to how we perceive the world. We also develop a <strong>value system</strong>, understanding that some things are more important than others. These two concepts, patterns and value, are the foundation of visual literacy.</p>

<h2>Figure-Ground Relationship</h2>

<p>A key concept in composition is the <strong>figure-ground relationship</strong>. This is about how the main subject (<strong>figure</strong>) relates to the background (<strong>ground</strong>). By placing a figure within a ground, you create a <strong>context</strong> for your image. For example, where you position a circle within a square can convey different feelings, like lightness, heaviness, movement, or stillness.</p>

<h2>The Nature of Visual Language</h2>

<p>Are there rules to composition? Not exactly. Visual language is complex and doesn't fit neatly into linear rules. It's not about following step-by-step instructions but about understanding the <strong>nature of this language</strong>. It's similar to music or written language but has its own unique qualities. The key is to learn how visual elements work together to communicate ideas.</p>

<h2>The Seven Visual Components</h2>

<p>There are <strong>seven visual components</strong> that make up our visual language:</p>

<ol>

<li><strong>Line</strong>: Implied or actual lines, like the horizon or an eyeline.</li>

<li><strong>Tone</strong>: The light and dark value structure.</li>

<li><strong>Color</strong>: Hue, value, and saturation.</li>

<li><strong>Shape</strong>: The forms and outlines within the image.</li>

<li><strong>Space</strong>: Can be flat, limited, deep, or ambiguous.</li>

<li><strong>Rhythm</strong>: The flow and movement within the composition.</li>

<li><strong>Direction</strong>: The visual forces and balance within shapes.</li>

</ol>

<h2>Methods of Measure: Major and Minor Key</h2>

<p>To organize these components, we use two methods of measure:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Major Key</strong>: The <strong>proportion</strong> of elements, like large vs. small areas.</li>

<li><strong>Minor Key</strong>: The <strong>range of contrast</strong>, such as high contrast vs. low contrast.</li>

</ul>

<p>These methods help us determine what's <strong>similar</strong> and <strong>different</strong> in our composition.</p>

<h2>Primaries of Design</h2>

<p>There are <strong>three primaries of design</strong> that influence style:</p>

<ol>

<li><strong>Line/Texture</strong>: Marks and lines on the surface.</li>

<li><strong>Form</strong>: Light vs. shadow, known as <strong>chiaroscuro</strong>.</li>

<li><strong>Mass</strong>: Light vs. dark patterning, known as <strong>Notan</strong>.</li>

</ol>

<p>These primaries interact to create different styles and effects. For instance, combining line and mass can create the illusion of form.</p>

<h2>Designing with Value</h2>

<p>When creating an image, start by designing a clear <strong>matrix</strong>, your basic design pattern. Determine your <strong>major key</strong> (overall lightness or darkness) and <strong>minor key</strong> (contrast range). Use <strong>value grouping</strong> to simplify your image - </p>

<ul>

<li>Break your values into <strong>five value ranges</strong>.</li>

<li>Eliminate intermediate values to keep edges clear.</li>

<li>Assign value ranges to different areas to maintain a strong read.</li>

</ul>

<p>By grouping values, you prevent your image from becoming muddy and ensure clarity.</p>

<h2>Practical Application</h2>

<p>When analyzing or creating compositions, consider:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Division of space</strong>: How you break down your image into areas.</li>

<li><strong>Rhythms and alignments</strong>: How shapes and lines lead the eye.</li>

<li><strong>Passive vs. active areas</strong>: Balancing areas of rest with areas of interest.</li>

<li><strong>Edge management</strong>: Using edges to define forms without unnecessary detail.</li>

</ul>

<p>For example, in a Notan-dominant composition, focus on light and dark patterns to shape your image. In a form-dominant composition, use light and shadow to create depth.</p>

<p>Understanding composition is about becoming fluent in the <strong>visual language</strong> of art. By learning the seven visual components, methods of measure, and primaries of design, you can create images that communicate your ideas clearly. Remember, there are no strict rules, just tools to help you express yourself. Keep practicing, analyzing, and experimenting with different compositions to enhance your visual literacy.</p>
