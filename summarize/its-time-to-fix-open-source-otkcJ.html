<h2>The Problem with Open Source Funding</h2>

<p>It's no secret that huge companies benefit immensely from open source software without contributing their fair share of money back to the maintainers. Projects like Elasticsearch have been heavily used by services like AWS without proper compensation. Many companies rely on open source software but fail to support those who build and maintain it.</p>

<h2>Introducing the Open Source Pledge</h2>

<p>I'm excited about a new initiative kickstarted by Sentry called <strong>The Open Source Pledge</strong>. This project aims to push companies to help fund the open source software that they rely on. The pledge is simple yet impactful: companies commit to paying open source maintainers a minimum of <strong>$2,000 per developer per year</strong>.</p>

<h2>How the Pledge Works</h2>

<p>The goal is to scale contributions based on the size of the company's development team. For companies with many developers, this pledge represents a small fraction of their overall expenses but can make a significant difference for open source maintainers.</p>

<p>To participate, companies need to:</p>

<ul>

<li>Contribute <strong>a minimum of $2,000 per developer per year</strong> to open source maintainers.</li>

<li><strong>Publicly report</strong> these contributions on a blog or similar platform, outlining the payments made and where the funds went.</li>

</ul>

<p>This initiative isn't aimed at individual developers but at larger companies that heavily utilize open source software without giving back.</p>

<h2>The Impact and Benefits</h2>

<p>This is a fantastic way for companies to show appreciation for the digital public goods they depend on. Several companies have already joined the pledge, including GitButler, Laravel, Browserless, and more. By participating, companies can:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Support the sustainability</strong> of the open source ecosystem.</li>

<li><strong>Improve their brand image</strong> by demonstrating a commitment to the community.</li>

<li><strong>Enhance software security</strong> by investing in the projects they use.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Motivation Behind the Pledge</h2>

<p>David Cramer, the founder of Sentry, shared the motivations for building this initiative. He recognized that while many founders talk about the importance of open source, few actually contribute in meaningful ways. This pledge is a way to not only provide financial support but also to set an example and encourage a culture of giving back.</p>

<h2>Why Companies Should Join</h2>

<p>For companies, the return on investment includes:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Brand Marketing</strong>: Aligning with open source values can attract customers and talent who care about community contributions.</li>

<li><strong>Supply Chain Security</strong>: Encouraging maintainers to continue their work ensures the longevity and reliability of the software they depend on.</li>

</ul>

<p>Participating in the Open Source Pledge is a modest expense in the grand scheme but can have a significant positive impact on the overall ecosystem.</p>

<p>I'm genuinely excited that Sentry is putting their money where their mouth is and trying to make open source more sustainable. How do you feel about this initiative? Are you going to push for your company to participate? Supporting open source maintainers is crucial for the health of the tech community, and every bit helps.</p>
