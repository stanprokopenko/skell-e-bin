<h2>Branching in ChatGPT</h2>

<p>OpenAI added <strong>conversation branching</strong> in ChatGPT. I can now fork a chat into different directions without losing the original context. This fixes the pain of long, linear threads where I jump back eight messages and hope it holds together.</p>

<p>Power users flagged this early in testing. It should help with <strong>comparative prompts</strong>, retracing steps after a dead end, and strategy or ideation work. As Sam Altman has framed GPT-6 around <strong>memory</strong> and user control of context, this feels like a small but meaningful step in that direction.</p>

<h2>Agentic Coding: Measuring What Matters</h2>

<p>The growth of <strong>vibe or agentic coding</strong> apps is a defining story this year. It is currently my pick for the <strong>most important AI phenomenon of 2025</strong>. Revenue is up, but usefulness needs better measures.</p>

<p>Coinbase’s Brian Armstrong said around <strong>40% of daily coding is AI generated</strong>, pushing for over 50% next month. More interesting, <strong>Lovable</strong> CEO Antoine shifted success metrics to the <strong>traffic users’ products get</strong>, citing 100 million visits in two months. This echoes earlier data: projects on <strong>lovable.app</strong> reached ~10 million monthly visits, while <strong>replit.app</strong> projects hit a couple million. Tracking downstream traffic helps show we are moving past novelty into building real things.</p>

<h2>On-Device Models: Embedding Gemma</h2>

<p>Google introduced <strong>Embedding Gemma</strong>, an open model that runs entirely <strong>on device</strong>. It is the top model under 500 million parameters on <strong>MTEB</strong>, with performance comparable to models nearly twice its size. As an <strong>embedding</strong> model, it targets search, retrieval, and RAG, not text generation. The aim is clear: enable private, local AI features on phones and other devices.</p>

<h2>AI Browser Wars: Atlassian + DIA</h2>

<p>Atlassian is acquiring <strong>The Browser Company</strong> for <strong>610 million</strong>. Their agentic AI browser <strong>DIA</strong> will shift from consumer tasks like shopping and showtimes to a <strong>work-focused AI browser</strong>. Atlassian’s view: Chrome and Edge serve everyone, which limits specialization. The goal is a better tool for <strong>knowledge workers</strong>. The window is tight. Leaders expect the AI browser winner to emerge in <strong>1 to 2 years</strong>, and distribution will decide who competes at scale.</p>
