<h2>Why We’re Here</h2>

<p>We learn best when we can ask questions and get direct answers. This conversation shifts from scripted lessons to real dialogue. The focus: how to use critiques well and whether studying photorealism helps other styles.</p>

<h2>Critiques and the Feedback Loop</h2>

<p>A <strong>feedback loop</strong> is simple: we do a thing, we make mistakes, we measure the result, we adjust, then repeat. The measure can be a teacher, a tool, or any method that tells us what is off. This loop is central to learning drawing, painting, music, and sports.</p>

<h3>Why We Fear Critiques</h3>

<p>Critiques can feel like proof we failed. They are emotional, especially when they feel personal. Marshall mentions the “<strong>fundamental attribution error</strong>,” where a mistake gets turned into a judgment of character. Machines that point out errors do not trigger the same reaction because they are not judging us. Human feedback can feel like an attack.</p>

<h3>Objective vs Subjective Feedback</h3>

<p>Some feedback is <strong>objective</strong>: anatomy, perspective, value structure, proportion. It can be checked. Other feedback is <strong>subjective</strong>: taste, color choice, style. Much group critique drifts into “it should have been orange,” which teaches little.</p>

<p>We should ask: who is giving the critique, and do we trust them? Are they helping us reach our goals, or trying to make our work match their taste?</p>

<h3>Giving and Receiving Critiques Well</h3>

<p>Marshall dislikes the <strong>sandwich technique</strong> (compliment, problem, compliment) as a formula. Politeness is fine, but empty padding often hides the point.</p>

<p>A better approach:

- Seek clear, actionable notes on objective issues.

- Treat subjective notes as prompts, not commands. Use what helps, discard what does not.

- Avoid personal labels. Critique the work, not the person.</p>

<h3>Finding the Right Balance</h3>

<p>People tend to fall into four patterns:

- Fearful of critique and cannot improve.

- Actively invite critique and grow fast.

- Ingest every opinion and lose personal vision.

- Reject feedback entirely and rely only on personal vision.</p>

<p>The ideal is a <strong>tension between open and closed</strong>, like an umbrella that works only with both. We stay open to help that moves us toward our vision and closed to advice that pulls us off course.</p>

<h3>Learn with a Small, Focused Community</h3>

<p>A small, aligned group helps us avoid being yanked in many directions. Shared fundamentals with individual voices give variety without chaos. Mentors who understand where we want to go are key.</p>

<h2>Photorealism and Skill Building</h2>

<h3>Why Study Representational Realism</h3>

<p>We do not need to chase extreme detail, but <strong>representational goals</strong> hold us to high standards. They teach color theory, light on form, value, and accuracy. Reality gives <strong>objective checkpoints</strong>. If it is off, it is off. That clarity accelerates learning.</p>

<h3>Using Photos to Train Technique</h3>

<p>Copying photos can train:

- Sensitivity to value and edge control with graphite or ink.

- Color and temperature judgment with paint or watercolor.

- Material handling in any medium.</p>

<p>It is a practical way to build skill fast, with clear measures of success.</p>

<h3>Style and Borrowing from Masters</h3>

<p>Style can be studied by <strong>copying stylistic masters</strong>. We can adopt “artistic parents,” imitate their solutions, and switch styles to fit the project. We should not rely on imitation forever, but it is a strong path to learn design, taste, and flexibility. Professionals blend influences, pay homage, and evolve their own voice over time.</p>

<h2>Bottom Line</h2>

<ul>

<li>Use critiques to power the feedback loop.</li>

<li>Prefer objective corrections. Treat subjective notes as options.</li>

<li>Choose trustworthy mentors and a small, aligned community.</li>

<li>Study representational realism to sharpen the eye and hand.</li>

<li>Borrow from masters to explore style, then shape it into our own.</li>
