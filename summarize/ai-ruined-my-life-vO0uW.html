<h2>Embracing Creativity</h2>

<p>I've always loved creative projects, from making music videos to aspiring to be a director of photography. Craftsmanship and perfecting every detail was my passion. I enjoyed honing my skills and creating professional-quality work.</p>

<h2>The Impact of AI Tools</h2>

<p>Then <strong>AI and accessible tools like CapCut</strong> changed everything. Clients began saying, "I can do that with this tool." Suddenly, anyone could produce videos with minimal effort. <strong>Professional craftsmanship was devalued</strong>, and my hard-earned skills felt less appreciated.</p>

<h2>Challenges on TikTok</h2>

<p>I turned to TikTok as a creative outlet and gained <strong>430,000 followers</strong>. For a while, it was fulfilling and exciting. But around 2022, as AI tools became mainstream, the platform shifted. <strong>Content quality mattered less than quantity</strong>. People used AI to generate videos quickly, and <strong>competing with automated content became tough</strong>.</p>

<h2>The Flood of Content</h2>

<p>With <strong>lowered barriers to entry</strong>, everyone could create content easily. Competition wasn't about skill or creativity anymore but about who could produce more content faster. <strong>Hard work and originality were overshadowed</strong> by a flood of AI-generated content.</p>

<h2>Being Replaced by AI</h2>

<p>Seeking new opportunities, I wrote scripts for a YouTube channel, helping it grow from 200,000 to 600,000 followers. My scripts garnered millions of views. However, after taking a week off due to a personal loss, I was replaced. <strong>They used AI to generate scripts</strong>, continuing the series I started without needing a human writer.</p>

<h2>Struggling in Publishing</h2>

<p>I decided to try Amazon KDP to publish books, hoping to find value in writing. Yet again, <strong>AI dominates</strong>, with people using it to churn out books rapidly by exploiting keywords and trends. I don't want to produce AI-generated content, I want my work to be authentic and meaningful. But <strong>competing without AI feels impossible</strong>.</p>

<h2>The Devaluation of Skills</h2>

<p>Every time I develop a valuable skill, <strong>AI makes it obsolete</strong>. It's disheartening to see years of hard work replaced by algorithms and automation. It feels like being a craftsman in an age that no longer values craftsmanship. My ability to contribute meaningfully feels diminished.</p>

<h2>Reflecting on the Future</h2>

<p>I sometimes wish I was born 30 years ago, when creativity and skill were more appreciated. Now, with AI pervasive in every industry, I wonder if it's even worth pursuing new skills that might soon be replaced. <strong>I'm not complaining</strong>, I'm expressing how AI has impacted my life and career.</p>

<h2>Seeking Connection</h2>

<p>I wonder if anyone else feels this way, struggling to keep up as AI transforms industries. <strong>If you have thoughts or ideas, let me know.</strong> I'm open to suggestions and looking for ways to navigate this new, AI-driven landscape.</p>
