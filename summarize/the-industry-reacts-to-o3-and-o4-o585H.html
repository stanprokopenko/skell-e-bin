<p>This week, OpenAI released its new models, <strong>03</strong> and <strong>04 Mini</strong>, and the AI industry is buzzing. These models represent significant advancements in artificial intelligence, showcasing remarkable improvements in reasoning, tool usage, and problem-solving.</p>

<h2>The 03 Model: Near Genius-Level Intelligence</h2>

<p><strong>Daria Enutz</strong>, who had early access to OpenAI's recent releases, stated that the <strong>03 model is at or near genius level</strong>. It achieved an <strong>IQ score of 136 on the Mensa IQ test</strong>, surpassing all previous models. The prior leader, <strong>Gemini 2.5 Pro</strong>, had an IQ of 128. This places 03 at the top among AI models.</p>

<h3>Tool Usage and Iterative Reasoning</h3>

<p>One of the most impressive features of 03 is its ability to <strong>use tools effectively within its chain of thought</strong>. It can write and execute code, utilize tools iteratively, and handle multi-step tasks with incredible reasoning and precision. For example, when asked to calculate the average compound daily growth rate of apples, it wrote and executed Python code within its reasoning process.</p>

<h2>04 Mini: Further Enhancements</h2>

<p>The <strong>04 Mini</strong> model builds upon the advancements of 03. Independent evaluations show that <strong>04 Mini leads in coding intelligence</strong>, achieving the highest score on the Artificial Analysis Intelligence Index. It surpasses previous models in coding tasks, demonstrating significant gains in coding ability and reasoning.</p>

<h2>Exceptional Performance in Geolocation Tasks</h2>

<p>The new models have shown extraordinary capabilities in <strong>geolocation tasks</strong>, such as GeoGuessr challenges. They can determine precise locations from random images with minimal clues.</p>

<h3>GeoGuessr Examples</h3>

<p>In one instance, 03 was given a random Street View image and, after careful reasoning, accurately identified it as somewhere in eastern Canada, specifically rural Quebec. In another example, it deduced the exact restaurant in Chicago where a photo of a dish was taken, recognizing specific details about the dish and the restaurant's features.</p>

<h3>Implications</h3>

<p>These feats highlight the models' ability to process and analyze visual information at an advanced level. However, this also raises concerns about privacy. We should be cautious about the images and locations we share online, as AI models can now pinpoint locations from minimal data.</p>

<h2>Outstanding Mathematical Capabilities</h2>

<p>The models excel in mathematical problem-solving. <strong>03 solved a recent Project Euler problem in under three minutes</strong>, outperforming human solvers who typically take much longer. It demonstrates exceptional proficiency in solving complex math problems, sometimes even generating solutions faster than the world's fastest human solvers.</p>

<h2>Limitations and Inconsistencies</h2>

<p>Despite their advancements, the models are not without flaws. In some tests, 03 gave incorrect responses. For instance, when asked how many "R"s are in the word "strawberry," it sometimes gave the wrong answer. This inconsistency indicates that while the models are highly advanced, they can still make mistakes.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p>OpenAI's 03 and 04 Mini models represent a significant step forward in AI capability. They showcase remarkable improvements in intelligence, reasoning, tool usage, coding, geolocation, and mathematical problem-solving. While not perfect, their advancements bring us closer to AI models that can perform at or above human levels in various tasks. We look forward to exploring these models further and seeing how they can be applied to solve complex real-world problems.</p>
