<h2>The Journey to GPT-4.5</h2>

<p>We aimed to create GPT-4.5, a model <strong>10 times smarter</strong> than GPT-4. Starting two years ago, we planned extensively, conducting de-risking runs and preparing across systems and machine learning. Our goal was ambitious, and we knew it would require significant effort.</p>

<h2>Challenges at Massive Scale</h2>

<p>Building GPT-4.5 required <strong>significant people, time, and compute</strong>. Scaling up introduced challenges: rare issues at small scale became significant at large scale. We faced infrastructure failures, network faults, and hardware problems. Early in the run, failure rates were high, but as we resolved issues, stability improved.</p>

<p>A notable challenge was a bug in <code>torch.sum</code> causing intermittent crashes. Our team meticulously debugged and fixed this elusive bug, which improved performance and boosted morale.</p>

<h2>Data Efficiency and Collaboration</h2>

<p>As we scaled, <strong>data efficiency</strong> became crucial. Moving from compute-constrained to data-constrained, we need algorithms that learn more from the same data. Dan emphasized that focusing on data efficiency is key for training larger models.</p>

<p><strong>Close collaboration</strong> between our ML and systems teams was essential. We co-designed the model architecture, optimized performance, and addressed issues together. Amin noted that this teamwork was vital to our success.</p>

<h2>Key Insights</h2>

<p>We found that <strong>scaling laws hold</strong>: more compute and better algorithms lead to smarter models. Unsupervised learning compresses data, finds connections, and enhances intelligence in subtle ways. Alex highlighted that better pre-training lifts broad-based intelligence and aids generalization.</p>

<p>Building GPT-4.5 was challenging but rewarding. By focusing on data efficiency, system improvements, and collaboration, we believe we can push AI boundaries even further.</p>
