<h2>Early Inspiration</h2>

<p>When I was 14, I took night classes where Apple's campus is now. I'd always wanted to learn how to program computers so I could create things. On a flight to the Bay Area, I watched a documentary about John Carmack and John Romero, the creators of id Software and games like <strong>Doom</strong> and <strong>Wolfenstein</strong>. Seeing how two people writing code could change the world made me realize <strong>I can do that too</strong>.</p>

<h2>First Attempts at Startups</h2>

<p>My friend and I heard about Y Combinator opening up in Mountain View. We applied with a mobile social network idea but got a response from Paul Graham saying, "I don't think you can beat Sam," referring to Sam Altman's company, Loopt. That was our first rejection from YC. We applied again with a different idea: connecting people anywhere in the world using just your camera and microphone. That became Meeteor, and we got accepted.</p>

<p>However, I learned that you have to have conviction in your product vision. I got enamored with ideas from other founders and lost focus on what <strong>I was trying to do</strong>. Starting a company just for the sake of it is a mistake I made multiple times. <strong>The real thing to do is to solve problems</strong>.</p>

<h2>Lessons from 23andMe and Twitter</h2>

<p>After Meeteor failed, I joined 23andMe because I believed in the future of genomic sequencing. It taught me the importance of picking the right market and building something sustainable to <strong>ride the wave of growth</strong>.</p>

<p>Joining Twitter was intimidating. It was growing so fast and was understaffed, it was a mess, to be honest. As an engineer, I realized that if I put in the hours, I could carve out a place for myself. I spent 12 to 14 hours a day working on the product, and it didn't feel like work because I loved it. I'm most proud of building the embedded media feature within Twitter.</p>

<p>An interesting thing I learned is that <strong>fires are a good thing</strong>. They indicate that you have built something people want. Failing and crashing is a rite of passage, proof that your work is worth improving.</p>

<h2>Building LiveKit</h2>

<p>The internet wasn't built for transmitting audio and video. Back when I started Meeteor, real-time video didn't exist online. During the pandemic, I saw a need for this technology as everyone tried to bring real-life interactions onto the internet.</p>

<p>My co-founder David and I decided to build LiveKit, an open-source stack to make it easy for developers to integrate real-time streaming audio and video. We raised about $37 million, and have companies like <strong>OpenAI using us to power voice mode for ChatGPT</strong>. LiveKit runs 25% of 911 services, every week, someone's life is saved using video to coach them on delivering CPR.</p>

<p>While I have ambitions for where LiveKit is going, it's important to celebrate that <strong>we've already been successful</strong>. We help people access education and connect with one another, often without them paying us a dime. They're my favorite use cases.</p>

<h2>Advice for Entrepreneurs</h2>

<p>For those looking to build in spaces like AI or robotics, these are going to be <strong>the largest spaces in the history of humanity</strong>. But because things are changing so quickly, there's a benefit to waiting a bit. <strong>Consider joining a company at the forefront of AI</strong> to learn about the foundational elements, meet potential co-founders, and understand the problems around you.</p>

<p>My recommendation is to join a company you find exciting, and spend a couple of years really digging in. Inspiration will strike, don't force it. When it comes, you'll know and then you should pursue it fully.</p>
