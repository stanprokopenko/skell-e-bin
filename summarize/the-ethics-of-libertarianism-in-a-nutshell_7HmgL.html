<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>

<p>In the 2024 US election, we're seeing familiar rhetoric being deployed once again. Phrases like "This is the most important election of our lifetime" are common. I wonder why such sayings occur so often when each new election seems to surpass the previous in importance. Is it truly that ideological tensions are so high because one party corrupts society and American democracy? Certain individuals are supposedly responsible and should be opposed by politicians who stand for the people, despite the other side's perverse incentives.</p>

<p><strong>The Inescapable Culture War Metanarrative</strong></p>

<p>This especially reveals itself in the <strong>Culture War</strong>, where the youth, a focal point of emotional investment, are manipulated by an agenda engineered by the other side. If you don't want your family to live in a nightmarish hellhole, then this specific party is for you. What I just spewed seems impossible to escape as the Culture War metanarrative continues to pervade all aspects of life, forcing us to address it.</p>

<p>By creating an environment where pressures are persistently placed to incentivize people into engaging with political means, there appears to be no alternative. <strong>Social change comes about through the State</strong>, and that's how we will finally achieve a state of moral well-being. At least, that's how it goes according to the State's narrative.</p>

<p><strong>Questioning the Morality of the State</strong></p>

<p>Now, I can most definitely question the very idea of the State performing a moral act. By observing the various techniques employed by the State, its organization necessitates <strong>coercion</strong> as it would otherwise be incapable of upholding itself. Its subjects ought to pay some fee as if to provide restitution for a crime they never committed. The statist might respond, asserting that the State still defends the property titles of its citizens and is thus not violating any liberties. I don't get stumped by this rhetoric as I acknowledge the deceptive nature of such a claim.</p>

<p><strong>The State's Legitimization of Property and Subversion of Norms</strong></p>

<p>Most particularly, the statist fails to call into question these <strong>property titles</strong> acquired and gamified through the State's processes. The State legitimizes particular courses of action through these <strong>fiat properties</strong>, and thus subverts the ability for rational actors to form interpersonal norms, as the State has no regard for voluntary interaction. These actors become slaves to the State's own institutions that operate in reciprocal relationships with one another.</p>

<p><strong>Slavery to State Institutions</strong></p>

<p>This is, of course, contrary to the general perception of the State, where follies can be traced to some ideological entity that can be subverted through political action. The <strong>deep state</strong> narrative is a wonderful example of this, as it promotes the idea that the State can be fixed from within rather than viewing the State as a <strong>parasite</strong> in itself. It's all a mistake and blurs the fundamental sociology of the State, in which these co-dependent sectors operate through bureaucratic means to maximize their own efficiency.</p>

<p><strong>The Technical Interests of the State</strong></p>

<p>In other words, the State's interests are <strong>technical</strong>, not ideological. Moral responsibility and the State are thus two incompatible concepts, in spite of the propaganda purporting otherwise.</p>

<p><strong>Historical Roots of State-Society Inseparability</strong></p>

<p>In fact, we can trace these lies back to the Ancient Greeks, more specifically, <strong>Plato's idea of "polis"</strong>—Greek for city-state. The general gist of Plato's idea is that society and the State are intrinsically inseparable concepts. While I'm not saying that specifically Plato is haunting the modern world, it's rather a chain of ideas all mirroring this concept that culminates into falsehoods such as <strong>anarchy being a state of utter chaos</strong> lacking any trace of morality. However, this couldn't be any further from the truth.</p>

<p><strong>Libertarian Ethics and the Virtue Ethics Approach</strong></p>

<p><strong>Libertarians</strong> are able to demonstrate this through the study of <strong>ethics</strong>. More specifically, the <strong>thick libertarian</strong> approach will be employed, wherein ethics are described in terms of <strong>virtue</strong> rather than a categorical prescription. Ethics are treated as a subset of the social sciences, subsequently <strong>Praxeology</strong>, and henceforth we are not able to study ethics outside of a <strong>teleological context</strong>—that is, describing phenomena through a means-ends process. This is what distinguishes the virtue ethicist from a deontologist, something that we'll touch on in a bit.</p>

<p><strong>Addressing Hume's Guillotine (Is-Ought Gap)</strong></p>

<p>Now, a common objection to natural law is <strong>Hume's guillotine</strong>, also known as the <strong>is-ought gap</strong>. The guillotine simply states that you cannot derive a prescriptive ought-statement from purely descriptive is-statements. While this is a sound critique of prescriptive approaches to natural law, as per John Locke, it doesn't hold up against the application of an <strong>Aristotelian metaethical framework</strong> that speaks purely in terms of teleology independent of prescriptions. The application of Praxeology to ethics allows for a more consistent understanding of <strong>social ontology</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Anarchy in Voluntary Interactions</strong></p>

<p>Now, how does this relate to <strong>anarchism</strong>? Well, we have to understand that anarchy isn't an abstract ideal that doesn't entirely exist now. In fact, <strong>anarchy exists all around us</strong>. The reason why I say this is because <strong>interpersonal norms emerge all the time between individuals acting in a voluntary manner</strong>, as particular behaviors are incentivized for the sake of their own flourishing. These are <strong>organic norms</strong> that emerge naturally from the way in which people interact absent a unilateral organization such as the State.</p>

<p><strong>The State's Disruption of Organic Norms</strong></p>

<p>This allows for <strong>virtues</strong> to come about as emergent properties of the fact that mutually exclusive action cannot occur within a populated environment. The State, however, counters these organic norms by imposing their own laws legitimized through fiat property. This is a subversion of the ability for individuals to freely coordinate themselves around the end of interpersonal flourishing. Aristotle describes this flourishing as <strong>eudaimonia</strong>, which is of course not to be confused with some hedonistic conception of pleasure and happiness.</p>

<p><strong>Critique of Deontological and Consequentialist Ethics</strong></p>

<p>The reason why <strong>deontological and consequentialist frameworks</strong> fail is due to their attempt to characterize ethics outside of the teleological context by which they emerge, and thus are to be rejected by Austrian School enthusiasts. We have demonstrated via Praxeology that particular <strong>power dynamics</strong> are necessary for interpersonal flourishing to emerge, such as an <strong>equality of authority</strong>. In other words, <strong>property norms based around non-aggression</strong> are required to allow for individuals to freely coordinate themselves in evaluating action.</p>

<p><strong>The State's Incompatibility with Eudaimonia</strong></p>

<p>Therefore, the State is incompatible with eudaimonia as they necessarily impose restrictions via coercive means in order to maintain their own organization. A more ethical society can only be achieved if the State were to vanish.</p>

<p><strong>Critique of Hans-Hermann Hoppe's Argumentation Ethics</strong></p>

<p>Now, one might wonder what the issue is with framing ethics from a deontological or consequentialist perspective if they ultimately come to conclusions that sound similar on the surface. Well, look at <strong>Hans-Hermann Hoppe's argumentation ethics</strong>, which attempts to show that <strong>anarcho-capitalist law</strong> is true a priori. He does this through the idea of <strong>universal pragmatics</strong>, proposed by Marxist philosopher <strong>Jürgen Habermas</strong>. The general goal being a successful synthesis between the Kantian categorical imperative and Marxian dialectics. There is a conspicuous degree of irony there with how Hoppe applies it, but that would start an interesting yet controversial discussion in libertarian circles.</p>

<p><strong>Problems with Thin Libertarianism</strong></p>

<p>Looking past the complications with universal pragmatics and how <strong>Wittgenstein</strong> entirely dismantles its assumptions by demonstrating how information isn't interpreted in such a manner that presupposes necessary rules, alongside argumentation ethics' failure to recognize the distinction between <strong>claim rights and liberty rights</strong>, it's generally harmful to libertarians for its implications. We may see some statist organizational models as more hospitable to liberty-lovers than other regimes as they perform "less aggression." This explains <strong>Hoppean sympathies toward monarchy and feudal regimes</strong> that are blatantly incompatible with libertarianism. Furthermore, there are vulgar sympathies toward corporate entities that function from fiat property relations rather than genuine homesteading. This occurs regardless of whether or not a lot of regulation is taking place.</p>

<p><strong>The State's Self-Interest and Libertarianism</strong></p>

<p>What many people, including some anarchists, fail to see is that the State is always acting to <strong>maximize its own efficiency</strong> through techniques that establish an environment fit for their own interests. Hence, even <strong>deregulatory measures are incompatible with libertarianism</strong>, as they're simply means for the State to increase its own revenue by enriching the political economy. The <strong>thin libertarians</strong> operate around flawed Kantian assumptions, whereas the <strong>thick libertarians</strong> are able to properly grasp society via their <strong>Aristotelian and virtue ethicist approach</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>In conclusion, the best way to frame libertarianism is the following: <strong>A society wherein norms are emergent properties of homesteading rather than unilateral organization</strong>. There is an <strong>equality of authority</strong>. As for the study of ethics, it is a <strong>sociological technique</strong> for libertarians to identify behaviors that are compatible and/or incompatible with <strong>interpersonal flourishing</strong>.</p>
