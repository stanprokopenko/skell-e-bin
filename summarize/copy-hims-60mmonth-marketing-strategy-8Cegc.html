<h2>Remarkable Growth with Aggressive Marketing</h2>

<p>Hims and Hers is experiencing <strong>rapid, profitable growth</strong>. In their latest quarter, they earned <strong>$400 million</strong> in revenue with <strong>77% year-on-year growth</strong>, making <strong>$76 million</strong> in profit.</p>

<p>I've noticed they invest <strong>almost half their revenue in marketing</strong>, about <strong>$182 million</strong> per quarter. By investing in profitable marketing activities, they're able to scale aggressively. They know they'll get more out than they put in.</p>

<h2>Simple, Mobile-First Website</h2>

<p>Their website is <strong>simple</strong> and <strong>mobile-first</strong>, tailored for visitors already familiar with Hims. It swiftly guides users into a consultative process, increasing engagement by delaying lead capture until the end.</p>

<p>Their <strong>Good Health</strong> blog drives significant <strong>organic traffic</strong>. By covering health topics related to their treatments and optimizing content, they effectively funnel readers to their products.</p>

<h2>Strong Search Presence</h2>

<p>Through heavy investment in <strong>content marketing</strong> and <strong>SEO</strong>, they drive around <strong>1 million organic visitors per month</strong>. Their <strong>topic cluster approach</strong> and strong backlink profile boost their search rankings.</p>

<p>In <strong>paid search</strong>, they spend about <strong>$500,000 per month</strong> on desktop ads, focusing on brand terms with <strong>benefits-focused</strong> messaging.</p>

<h2>Effective Social and Video Advertising</h2>

<p>They allocate significant budget to <strong>social and video ads</strong>, favoring <strong>high-quality video content</strong> over solely UGC-style ads. Their top-performing ads are consistent in branding and messaging, emphasizing benefits to build familiarity.</p>

<p>Despite this, I've noticed their <strong>organic video content</strong> on platforms like YouTube and TikTok underperforms, revealing an area for improvement.</p>

<h2>Lessons Learned</h2>

<ul>

<li><strong>Strong Core Offering</strong>: Simple, competitively priced solutions addressing specific needs.</li>

<li><strong>User-Friendly Website</strong>: Mobile-first design with a consultative approach that smoothly guides users.</li>

<li><strong>Content and SEO Investment</strong>: High-quality, optimized content driving significant organic traffic.</li>

<li><strong>Aggressive Ad Strategy</strong>: Large ad spend with extensive testing and focus on high-performing video ads.</li>

<li><strong>Scaling Profitable Models</strong>: Rapid scaling once a profitable marketing strategy is found.</li>

</ul>

<p>Despite their massive success, they still have opportunities to improve, especially in their organic social video content.</p>
