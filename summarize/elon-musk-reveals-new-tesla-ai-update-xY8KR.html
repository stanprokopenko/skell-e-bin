<h2>Unsupervised FSD Coming Soon</h2>

<p>Elon Musk announced that <strong>Tesla's Full Self-Driving (FSD) has officially gone unsupervised</strong>. Thousands of Tesla vehicles have been driving themselves over thousands of miles without human intervention. Musk is confident that unsupervised FSD will launch in <strong>California and possibly other U.S. regions by the end of this year</strong>.</p>

<h2>Launching in Austin and Beyond</h2>

<p>Tesla plans to <strong>launch unsupervised FSD as a paid service in Austin, Texas, in June</strong>. This service will expand to other areas, with Musk stating that by <strong>2026, owners can add or remove their cars from the robo-taxi fleet</strong>, similar to how Airbnb operates.</p>

<h2>Progress and Safety</h2>

<p>By the end of 2024, Tesla reached nearly <strong>3 billion miles driven on FSD</strong>. In Q4 2024, there was <strong>one crash for every 5.94 million miles driven</strong> using autopilot technology, compared to the U.S. average of one crash every 0.7 million miles. Tesla emphasizes <strong>extreme caution and safety standards</strong> before a full rollout, aiming to be significantly safer than human drivers.</p>

<h2>Hardware Upgrades and Licensing</h2>

<p>Owners who purchased FSD outright will receive a <strong>complimentary hardware upgrade</strong>. Those subscribing monthly will not receive a free upgrade. Musk acknowledged that the <strong>hardware replacement process will be challenging</strong> but assured it will be done.</p>

<p>Tesla is seeing <strong>significant interest from other automakers</strong> in licensing FSD. They are considering partnerships where the <strong>volume will be very high</strong>, focusing on larger manufacturers due to the complexity involved.</p>

<h2>International Challenges</h2>

<p>In Europe, Tesla faces a <strong>layered bureaucracy</strong> for FSD approval. The approval process involves multiple government levels and could take significant time. In China, <strong>data restrictions prevent Tesla from exporting video</strong> from Chinese cars to their U.S.-based AI training centers. Tesla is using <strong>publicly available videos and simulations</strong> to train their AI for Chinese roads.</p>

<h2>Autonomous Operations in Fremont</h2>

<p><strong>New Tesla vehicles from the Fremont Factory are now driving themselves autonomously</strong> for 1.2 miles from General Assembly to their loading dock without human intervention. This marks a significant step in internal autonomous operations.</p>

<h2>Expansion of Mega Factories</h2>

<p>Tesla is <strong>building a third Mega Pack factory</strong>. The energy business achieved a record in Q4 with its highest-ever gross profit. Q4 energy storage deployments were <strong>11 GWh, a 224% increase</strong> from Q4 2023. The <strong>Shanghai Mega Factory</strong> construction is completed and will begin ramping up in Q1.</p>

<h2>Upcoming Vehicles and Production</h2>

<p>Plans for <strong>new, more affordable vehicles</strong> remain on track for production in the <strong>first half of 2025</strong>. These vehicles will utilize aspects of both the Next Generation platform and current platforms. Tesla faces a <strong>battery pack constraint</strong> but is working to address it.</p>

<h2>Tesla Semi and Cyber Cab</h2>

<p>Construction of the <strong>Tesla Semi Factory</strong> continued in Q4. First truck builds are scheduled to start by the <strong>end of 2025</strong>, with a ramp beginning in early 2026. The <strong>Cyber Cab</strong>, Tesla's purpose-built robotaxi, will use a revolutionary manufacturing strategy and is scheduled for <strong>volume production starting in 2026</strong>.</p>

<h2>Cost Efficiency and New Features</h2>

<p>In Q4, the <strong>cost per vehicle reached its lowest level ever at less than $35,000</strong>. Tesla plans to carry over new technologies from the Cybertruck to future vehicles, including:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>800-volt battery packs</strong></li>

<li><strong>Peak charging up to 500 kW</strong></li>

<li><strong>48-volt electrical systems</strong></li>

<li><strong>Steer-by-wire and rear-wheel steering</strong></li>

<li><strong>Innovative glass and sound isolation techniques</strong></li>

</ul>

<h2>Stainless Steel and Future Plans</h2>

<p>For now, Tesla has <strong>abandoned the idea of building vehicles other than the Cybertruck in stainless steel</strong>. Future vehicles will incorporate many of the advancements introduced with the Cybertruck, enhancing performance and efficiency.</p>
