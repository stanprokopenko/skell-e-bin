<h2>Practicing What I Preach</h2>

<p>I've always advocated for <strong>radical alignment</strong>, the idea of restructuring your life to align with your values and needs. Recently, I realized it was time to <strong>walk the walk</strong>. That's why I announced to the world that I'm <strong>quitting AI</strong>. It's not that AI isn't important, it's just no longer aligned with who I am and where I need to go.</p>

<h2>The Catalyst: A Psychedelic Retreat</h2>

<p>This summer solstice, under a full moon in Colorado, I attended a legal <strong>psychedelic retreat</strong>. The experience was <strong>intense but perfect</strong>, and it helped me see that I wasn't where I needed to be. There's probably a direct line between that retreat and my decision to leave AI. Psychedelics can have a profound effect, sometimes leading people to make life-changing decisions.</p>

<h2>Understanding Radical Alignment</h2>

<p><strong>Radical alignment</strong> means making bold choices to ensure your life aligns with your true self. It's about listening to the universe, or your own consciousness, telling you that something isn't right. You might feel happier, doors might open, and life may feel more effortless when you are in alignment.</p>

<h3>Signs You're Out of Alignment</h3>

<ul>

<li>Feeling angry or sick</li>

<li>Doors closing in your face</li>

<li>Opportunities evaporating</li>

<li>Persistent feelings that something isn't right</li>

</ul>

<h2>Trusting Your Inner Knowing</h2>

<p>So how do you know what you're supposed to be doing? <strong>You just know</strong>. If you fight it, you'll likely face resistance in various forms. Sometimes, people rely on external substances to give them answers, but the real guidance comes from within.</p>

<h2>Moving Forward</h2>

<p>For me, this means focusing on <strong>writing</strong> and possibly <strong>advocating for psychedelic legalization</strong>. I'm excited about this new direction and feel more aligned with my purpose than ever before.</p>

<p>I wanted to document my thoughts on radical alignment. If you got something out of it, let me know. Cheers!</p>
