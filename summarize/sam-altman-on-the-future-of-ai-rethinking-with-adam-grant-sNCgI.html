<h2>Navigating Unexpected Change</h2>

<p>When I was fired from my own company, it was a surreal experience. Confusion was the dominant emotion at first. Then came frustration, anger, sadness, and gratitude. It was a whirlwind of feelings over just four days. There wasn't much time to process it all because there was so much to do. Tactically, I had to focus on what needed to be done.</p>

<h2>Lessons Learned</h2>

<p>Looking back, I realized we could have communicated better during and after the process. Being <strong>direct and clear</strong> about what's happening is crucial. There was a cloud of suspicion over OpenAI for a long time, and we could have handled that better.</p>

<p>One of the proudest moments for me was seeing how <strong>the team operated without me</strong>. They proved they were capable of running the company. It showed me that picking the right people and teaching them was vital.</p>

<h2>The Impact of AI on Humanity</h2>

<p>I've been thinking a lot about what's going to happen to humans as AI advances. Our latest model feels <strong>smarter than me in almost every way</strong>, but it doesn't really impact my day-to-day life. I still care about the same things.</p>

<p>Over the long term, AI will change everything. The whole economy will transform, and we will find new things to do. I'm not worried about jobs disappearing, we always find new roles as technology evolves.</p>

<h2>Shifting from Ability to Agility</h2>

<p>In the future, we'll stop valuing raw intellectual horsepower and start valuing <strong>agility</strong>, how quickly we can adapt. The ability to <strong>connect dots</strong> and synthesize information will be more important than collecting facts. Figuring out <strong>what questions to ask</strong> will matter more than finding the answers.</p>

<h2>The Human-AI Relationship</h2>

<p>People often overestimate short-term change and underestimate long-term impact. Even though our AI is incredibly powerful, my life doesn't feel that different. Over time, we'll learn to coexist with AI as a powerful tool.</p>

<p>I use ChatGPT in mundane ways, processing emails and summarizing documents. I don't use it to come up with new scientific ideas. But for many, AI can augment their creativity and help them work in new ways.</p>

<h2>Empathy and Human Connection</h2>

<p>Interestingly, AI can sometimes provide more empathy and support than humans in text conversations. But I believe we're hardwired to <strong>care about humans, not AI</strong>. Even as we interact more with AI, we'll still crave human connection. AI might be helpful, but it won't fulfill our deep social needs.</p>

<h2>Addressing AI Hallucinations</h2>

<p>Some are concerned about AI's tendency to "hallucinate" or produce inaccurate information. While earlier models had this issue, our current models are much more robust. Teaching the model when to <strong>express uncertainty</strong> is still an area of research, but we're making progress.</p>

<h2>Collaboration Between Humans and AI</h2>

<p>In fields like medicine, AI can outperform doctors alone. However, doctors might not benefit fully from AI assistance if they override the AI's recommendations. We need to figure out how <strong>humans and AI can work together</strong> effectively.</p>

<h2>Ethical Considerations and Regulation</h2>

<p>Humans must <strong>set the rules</strong> for AI, AI can follow them, but <strong>we need to define them</strong>. Regulation will be important, but it's tricky to get the balance right. We need <strong>testing and understanding</strong> as starting points.</p>

<p>I don't believe historical analogies, like the arms race, fully apply to AI. We should ground discussions in what makes AI different and design systems accordingly.</p>

<h2>Personal Reflections</h2>

<p>People often ask why I'm doing this work. I'm a <strong>techno-optimist and science nerd</strong>. Being part of this scientific revolution is the coolest thing I can imagine. I feel a sense of <strong>duty to contribute to scientific progress</strong> and help improve the human experience.</p>

<p>As a soon-to-be father, I hope for a world of <strong>abundance and prosperity</strong>, a world where people can do more and live better lives.</p>
