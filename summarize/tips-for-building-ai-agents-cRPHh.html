<p>In the rapidly evolving landscape of artificial intelligence, understanding how to build effective agents is crucial. Agents are autonomous AI programs that can perform tasks without explicit instructions at every step. We aim to clarify what agents are, how they differ from workflows, and offer insights for developers building with AI.</p>

<h2>Agents vs. Workflows</h2>

<p><strong>Agents</strong> are AI systems that decide on their own actions and how many steps to take to achieve a goal. They loop until they find a resolution. For example, an agent can autonomously interact with a user for customer support or iterate on code changes.</p>

<p>In contrast, <strong>workflows</strong> are predefined sequences of AI calls arranged by code. They are like fixed rails that the AI follows through a set number of steps. Each prompt in a workflow is specific and transforms input to output in a controlled manner.</p>

<h2>Designing Effective Agents</h2>

<p>When designing agents, it's important to:</p>

<ul>

<li>

<p><strong>Provide Clear Context</strong>: Agents need detailed information about their tasks. We should be empathetic to the model and ensure the prompt, tool descriptions, and environment are clearly defined.</p>

</li>

<li>

<p><strong>Think Like the Model</strong>: Put ourselves in the model's perspective. Consider what information the model has and what it needs to perform effectively.</p>

</li>

<li>

<p><strong>Document Tools Thoroughly</strong>: Ensure that any tools or functions provided to the agent have clear documentation. Avoid bare-bones implementations with unclear parameters.</p>

</li>

</ul>

<h2>Common Pitfalls</h2>

<ul>

<li>

<p><strong>Overcomplicating Tasks</strong>: Not every problem requires an agent. Sometimes, simpler solutions like workflows suffice. Use agents when the task is complex and the number of steps isn't known beforehand.</p>

</li>

<li>

<p><strong>Lack of Verification</strong>: Without a feedback loop or method to verify the agent's actions, the agent may not converge on the correct solution. Incorporating ways to test and verify outputs is essential, especially in coding agents where unit tests can be used.</p>

</li>

</ul>

<h2>The Future of Agents</h2>

<p>We anticipate that agents will increasingly automate repetitive tasks, allowing us to scale activities that were once too time-consuming. For example, agents could automatically update documentation with every code change.</p>

<p>However, <strong>agents for consumers may be overhyped</strong>. Tasks like booking vacations involve complex personal preferences and high stakes, making full automation challenging without significant context.</p>

<h2>Advice for Developers</h2>

<ul>

<li>

<p><strong>Start Simple</strong>: Begin with basic implementations before adding complexity. Sometimes, a single AI call suffices.</p>

</li>

<li>

<p><strong>Measure Results</strong>: Have a way to evaluate your agent's performance. Without metrics, it's hard to know if your agent is effective or if a simpler solution would work.</p>

</li>

<li>

<p><strong>Build for the Future</strong>: Design your systems so they improve as AI models get better. Your product should become more valuable with advancements in AI capabilities.</p>

</li>

</ul>

<p>Building effective agents requires careful consideration of the AI's perspective, thorough documentation, and appropriate use cases. By understanding when and how to deploy agents, we can harness their potential to automate complex tasks and enhance productivity.</p>
