<h2>The Eroding Influence of Newspaper Endorsements</h2>

<p>Once upon a time, newspaper endorsements could sway voters. But those days are over. This election season, when papers like the Los Angeles Times and the Washington Post chose not to endorse a candidate, the outrage was palpable. Staffers felt betrayed, and subscriptions were canceled in protest. At the Nation magazine, interns wrote an op-ed opposing the endorsement of Kamala Harris.</p>

<h2>Our Choice Not to Endorse</h2>

<p>We've received questions about whether we'll endorse a candidate. Given our mission to inform rather than instruct, we're not endorsing anyone this year. At a recent retreat, we discovered our staff is split almost equally among supporters of Kamala Harris, Donald Trump, and those abstaining or undecided. This mirrors the divisions in our country.</p>

<h2>Valuing Diverse Perspectives</h2>

<p>At the Free Press, it's okay to be liberal, conservative, or politically non-binary. Unlike many newsrooms that think as one, we embrace a range of views. Half of America supports Trump, yet many media outlets can't stomach those perspectives. We believe in seeking and telling the truth, which allows us to <strong>disagree without disrespect</strong>. Politics need not be a team sport.</p>

<p>We're committed to restoring a culture where <strong>arguing, debating, persuading, and disagreeing</strong> are normal. If we can't sit next to colleagues who vote differently, how can we coexist in our communities? Building a publication and a community that aspires to these values is meaningful and important. We're grateful to live in a free country, and we're proud to reflect that freedom in our work.</p>
