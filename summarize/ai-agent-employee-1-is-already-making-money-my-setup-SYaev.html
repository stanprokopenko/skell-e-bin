<p>I've been running an <strong>AI agent</strong> for the past several weeks, and it's generated over <strong>$1,300 in revenue</strong>. I wanted to share how I set up this system that automates content creation and brings in passive income.</p>

<h2>Building the AI Agent</h2>

<p>I used <strong>cloud code</strong> and a <strong>Vercel template</strong> to quickly build a simple platform. The AI agent performs <strong>data collection</strong>, generates parody videos, and promotes content in a subtle way.</p>

<h2>The Workflow</h2>

<h3>Steps Involved</h3>

<ol>

<li><strong>Data Collection</strong>: The agent uses the <strong>YouTube API</strong> to download the latest videos from <strong>MoistCr1tikal's</strong> channel.</li>

<li><strong>Audio Extraction</strong>: It extracts the first 5 seconds of audio using <strong>FFmpeg</strong>, which serves as an intro.</li>

<li><strong>Transcription and Voiceover</strong>: The intro audio is transcribed, and a voiceover script is generated. I use <strong>11 Labs</strong> to create a voice that mimics the original.</li>

<li><strong>Video Generation</strong>: The agent generates prompts for three 10-second video clips using <strong>Replicate API</strong> and models like <strong>2.5 Pro</strong> and <strong>Cling</strong>.</li>

<li><strong>Video Assembly</strong>: The clips are merged together, ensuring coherence by using the last frame of one clip as the starting point for the next.</li>

<li><strong>Cleanup and Upload</strong>: Temporary files are removed, and the video is uploaded to YouTube with autogenerated metadata.</li>

</ol>

<h2>The Results</h2>

<p>The generated videos are <strong>AI-generated parodies</strong> that often turn out amusing. While some are better than others, they consistently engage viewers. The videos include a simple note with a link for those interested in learning more.</p>

<h2>Ethical Considerations</h2>

<p>I make sure to <strong>clearly label</strong> the content as AI-generated. Transparency is important, and I avoid misleading viewers. The aim is to entertain, not to deceive.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p>This setup has been a great source of passive income with minimal effort after the initial setup. If you're interested in creating similar workflows, I hope this gives you some inspiration. Just remember to be transparent about using AI in your content.</p>
