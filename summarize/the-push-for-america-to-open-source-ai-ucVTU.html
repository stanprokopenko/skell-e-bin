<h2>A New Challenger: DeepSeek's Impact</h2>

<p>It's been a few weeks since <strong>DeepSeek</strong>, a Chinese AI company spun out of a hedge fund, launched and <strong>challenged expectations about U.S. AI dominance</strong>. While companies like <strong>OpenAI</strong> were providing subpar models for free, DeepSeek offered a <strong>reasoning model</strong> with innovative UI features that exposed its thought process. Their use of <strong>distillation techniques</strong> allowed them to achieve high performance with minimal resources, stirring debate and disbelief.</p>

<h2>Open Source vs Closed Source AI</h2>

<p>The most significant shift is in how we think about <strong>open source versus closed source AI</strong>. Despite its name, <strong>OpenAI</strong> moved towards closed policies, citing safety concerns over sharing model weights. Critics argue this is more about competitiveness than safety. Interestingly, DeepSeek has become the de facto <strong>open source leader</strong>, while most American firms keep their methodologies secret.</p>

<h2>Implications for U.S. AI Strategy</h2>

<p>Former Google CEO <strong>Eric Schmidt</strong> highlighted that DeepSeek's open source approach might <strong>shift the balance of power</strong> between the U.S. and China. With models like <strong>R1</strong> and <strong>Janus Pro</strong>, DeepSeek not only matches but outperforms U.S. counterparts, and makes them <strong>open source</strong>. This raises questions about the U.S. strategy, even <strong>Sam Altman</strong> acknowledges the need for a new open source approach.</p>

<p>Some in the industry, like <strong>Dario Amodei</strong> of Anthropic, express safety concerns about open models. Others, like <strong>Marc Andreessen</strong>, argue that open source is inevitable and beneficial. Even <strong>Baidu</strong> is now open sourcing its models, suggesting a broader shift.</p>

<h2>The Path Forward</h2>

<p>I sense that the AI landscape is changing, with <strong>open source models gaining prominence</strong>. The big question is how this will play out in the policy sphere, as it could shape the future of AI development. For now, we watch as the industry grapples with this <strong>open source revolution</strong>.</p>
