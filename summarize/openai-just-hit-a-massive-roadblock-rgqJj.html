<h2>Ownership Shift</h2>

<p>I open the letter by asking who will <strong>own AGI</strong> if OpenAI goes ahead with its new structure. The original rule said any <strong>true AGI</strong> had to be created and held by the nonprofit so it would serve humanity. Under the new plan, the <strong>for-profit arm and its investors</strong> would take control. That change would give big investors open access to powerful technology that was once off-limits. OpenAI has not told the public who would own AGI after the change, but every report I read points to the company and its backers. I also see stories that OpenAI and Microsoft have discussed ending the limits on Microsoft’s use of the tech, an idea that would break earlier promises.</p>

<h2>Broken Promises</h2>

<p>I remember Sam Altman’s May 2023 testimony, where he praised <strong>nonprofit control, a profit cap, and other guardrails</strong>. Now I hear him call those same guardrails “obstacles” he wants to remove. I ask myself what flipped between May 2023 and September 2024.  </p>

<p>The charter once held a <strong>“stop-and-assist” pledge</strong>: if another safe group pulled ahead in the AGI race, OpenAI would halt and help that group finish the job. A profit-driven model would almost surely drop that promise and speed up a reckless race. I can’t picture OpenAI stepping aside to assist a rival when control of AGI is on the line.</p>

<h2>Mission vs. Investor Demands</h2>

<p>OpenAI began with charitable gifts aimed at <strong>“AGI that benefits humanity.”</strong> By law those donations must fund the purpose for which they were given. Using them to build a for-profit empire breaks that trust, and I expect a legal fight over who controls AGI.  </p>

<p>Inside the company I see growing tension. Leaders blame <strong>investor pressure</strong> for the restructuring. Investors dislike the profit cap and want a simpler capital structure. Some late-stage funding even lets backers pull out unless the structure changes. So OpenAI sits between <strong>“look like the bad guy”</strong> if it restructures and <strong>“lose investors”</strong> if it refuses.</p>

<h2>Safety Risks</h2>

<p>OpenAI’s own papers warn that AGI could cause <strong>grave harm or extinction</strong>. Altman and Geoffrey Hinton signed a statement putting AI risk on par with nukes and pandemics. That fear drove the strict rules at the start, yet drifting from them now makes the stakes higher.  </p>

<p>I read allegations that model testing is rushed and under-resourced. The firm backed off its vow to spend <strong>20 percent of compute on AGI safety</strong>. Jan Leike quit, saying profit had replaced mission. Such moves tell me safety is losing the internal battle.</p>

<h2>Additional Controversies</h2>

<p>Reports say Altman has floated <strong>cutting global compute access</strong> while seeking trillions for new chips, even from U.S. rivals. Departing staff face harsh <strong>non-disparagement agreements</strong>. A group of former employees, including Daniel Kokotajlo and other researchers, laid out <strong>ten core objections</strong> to the new direction. Geoffrey Hinton signed as well, which added weight to their concerns.</p>

<h2>What Happens Next</h2>

<p>Control of AGI is now worth more than almost anything else in tech. I will watch how OpenAI tries to square <strong>profit, safety, and its original promise</strong>. The company must choose: keep its founding mission or satisfy the investors who want the guardrails gone.</p>
