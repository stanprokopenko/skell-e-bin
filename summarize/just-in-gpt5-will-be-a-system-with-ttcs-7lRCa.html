<p>Sam Altman recently shared an <strong>OpenAI roadmap update</strong> about <strong>GPT-4.5</strong> and <strong>GPT-5</strong>. I want to break down what he said and what it means for the future of language models.</p>

<h2>Moving Away from the Model Picker</h2>

<p>Sam mentioned that they "hate the model picker as much as you do" and want to return to the magic of <strong>unified intelligence</strong>.</p>

<h3>What Is the Model Picker?</h3>

<p>In ChatGPT, the <strong>model picker</strong> lets you choose which model to use, like GPT-4 or GPT-3.5. While some might find this useful, OpenAI plans to eliminate it.</p>

<h3>Introducing the Model Router</h3>

<p>Instead of having users pick models, OpenAI will implement a <strong>model router</strong>. This system automatically directs your request to the most suitable model based on the task. For instance, simple queries go to less powerful models, saving resources, while complex ones go to more advanced models.</p>

<h2>GPT-4.5 (Orion): The Last Non-Chain-of-Thought Model</h2>

<p>OpenAI plans to release <strong>GPT-4.5</strong>, internally called <strong>Orion</strong>, as their last <strong>non-chain-of-thought</strong> model. This marks a shift toward models that can think through problems step by step.</p>

<h2>Embracing Chain-of-Thought Models</h2>

<p><strong>Chain-of-thought (CoT) models</strong> generate internal reasoning steps before providing an answer.</p>

<h3>How Do CoT Models Work?</h3>

<p>Instead of giving direct answers, CoT models think like we do:</p>

<ol>

<li><strong>Understand the question</strong>: Identify what's being asked.</li>

<li><strong>Plan</strong>: Outline steps to solve it.</li>

<li><strong>Reason</strong>: Work through each step.</li>

<li><strong>Answer</strong>: Provide the final solution.</li>

</ol>

<p>For example, solving a math problem involves calculating each step, not just stating the answer.</p>

<h2>GPT-5: A Unified System</h2>

<p>Rather than a single model, <strong>GPT-5</strong> will be a <strong>system</strong> combining various models and capabilities.</p>

<h3>Integrating Models and Capabilities</h3>

<ul>

<li><strong>Unified intelligence</strong>: GPT-5 will merge different models, like the GPT series and the <strong>O series</strong>, into one system.</li>

<li><strong>Model router</strong>: It will direct queries to the appropriate model based on the task.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Test-Time Scaling and Scaling Laws</h2>

<p>GPT-5 will utilize <strong>test-time scaling</strong>, allowing it to <strong>think longer</strong> on more complex tasks.</p>

<h3>What Is Test-Time Scaling?</h3>

<ul>

<li><strong>Scaling laws</strong>: The idea that more compute time can improve model accuracy.</li>

<li><strong>Thinking time</strong>: Like humans, the model spends more time reasoning through harder problems.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Different User Tiers and Thinking Time</h2>

<p>OpenAI may offer different service tiers:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>ChatGPT Plus subscribers</strong>: Access to higher intelligence with moderate thinking time.</li>

<li><strong>ChatGPT Pro subscribers</strong>: Even greater intelligence with extended thinking time.</li>

</ul>

<p>This means the model <strong>thinks longer and deeper</strong> for Pro users, leading to better results.</p>

<h2>Implications for the Future</h2>

<p>I'm excited about this direction. By using chain-of-thought models and test-time scaling, language models will become more capable and human-like in their reasoning.</p>

<h3>Potential Concerns</h3>

<ul>

<li><strong>Transparency</strong>: As models become systems, understanding their internal workings may become harder.</li>

<li><strong>Reproducibility</strong>: Complex systems might be more difficult to replicate or study in-depth.</li>

</ul>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p>OpenAI's move toward unified, chain-of-thought models like GPT-5 represents a significant evolution in AI. By allowing models to think more deeply and intelligently route queries, we're entering a new era of language models. I'm eager to see how these advancements unfold and impact our interactions with AI.</p>
