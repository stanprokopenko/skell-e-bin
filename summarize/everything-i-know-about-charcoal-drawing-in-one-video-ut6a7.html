<p>Hi, I'm Louise. Today I want to talk about one of my absolute favorite art mediums and hopefully inspire you to try it out for yourself. I'm talking about <strong>charcoal</strong>.</p>

<p>My love affair with charcoal started about a year ago. I had only tried it once or twice in figure drawing class a long time ago. I remembered it as messy, smudgy, and quite frustrating. I probably decided it wasn't for me.</p>

<p>Before then, I had been mostly drawing in <strong>graphite</strong>, which is tidier. But it never got dark enough for me. The more depth and shadow I tried to add, the more silvery and shiny my drawings became, and just sort of gray.</p>

<p>You might have guessed it from my videos so far, but my favorite color is black. It's all I ever wear, basically. I love black and white photography and art. I love the simplicity and the contrast of it. Also, my favorite birds are black and white and grayscale.</p>

<p>When I started drawing <strong>crows and ravens</strong> in charcoal a year ago, everything just clicked for me. This was the art medium of my soul. I felt like I could freely express myself with charcoal without holding back. I could be messy and get in there with my hands, finger-paint with powdered charcoal, or be very controlled with pencils and blending stumps. Corvid birds just looked amazing in this medium. It complemented their colors perfectly.</p>

<p>I mentioned this briefly in one of my other videos about painting and collections, and that my next project would be all about <strong>corvids</strong>. Now I have finally begun. This fall will be all about crows, ravens, magpies, and jackdaws, my spirit animals.</p>

<h2>Discovering PanPastel</h2>

<p>I stumbled on some artists here on YouTube using charcoal together with <strong>PanPastel</strong>, something I hadn't seen before. It's sort of like pastel, but compressed into a cake in a little pan. You apply it with a foamy, spongy palette knife that you dip in the pan.</p>

<p>The way that pastel came onto the paper, wow, it looked amazing and like so much fun. I was mesmerized, and I immediately went online and bought some for myself. It was love at first try.</p>

<p>Have you ever felt that with an art medium, where it just clicks for you, and the process of using it feels so satisfying, and you almost get addicted to it? That's how it was for me with charcoal in the beginning, and that's how I feel about PanPastel too.</p>

<p>In this guide, I want to talk about <strong>charcoal</strong> and why I adore it so much. I'll give you a basic guide to charcoal, show you all the tools I'm using, and how I use them. You'll also get to see some of my first charcoal crows that I've painted so far.</p>

<h2>Workstation Setup</h2>

<p>Let's start with the <strong>workstation</strong>. I've seen a lot of different setups online. Some people just draw straight up and down on a pad of paper, like with graphite pencil. Others tape their paper onto a board, like with watercolors. A lot of people clip the paper up on an easel, like when painting with oils or acrylics.</p>

<p>I went with something in between. It's good not to paint or draw with your canvas lying flat on the table, because it distorts your point of view and can create skewed angles and proportions. But I also find it really exhausting for my arms and shoulders to draw completely upright. So something in between works best for me.</p>

<p>I use a little <strong>laptop table</strong> that you can put in various degrees of tilt. It's really practical. To try to contain the mess of charcoal dust as best I can, I've placed a cut-out piece of fabric underneath to protect my desk, which is white. Why do I have a white desk and white drawers and white electronics and white walls and white floors in my home studio? I really should do something about that. There are smudge marks everywhere right now.</p>

<p>Anyways, this cloth does the job because the dust and the powder stick to it. I also use it to wipe off excess charcoal sometimes. I mean, the stuff still gets everywhere, but at least I'm not as hyper-aware and self-conscious about it.</p>

<h2>Materials and Tools</h2>

<h3>PanPastel</h3>

<p>Up first is my new darling, the <strong>PanPastel</strong>. As you can see, it looks kind of like makeup, and the consistency is kind of like that too. It's very compressed but a little powdery when you apply it to the paper. Even though you could probably just dip your fingers in it, the real joy is when using these sponges and this palette knife that you put these little foamy tips on.</p>

<p>These feel exactly like makeup sponges, same material and consistency. When you dip them in the pastel and apply them to the paper, it's buttery smooth, and you have such perfect control over the gradient of the stroke. Just like with a charcoal stick, you can create crisp edges or lines, or you can make broad or angled strokes to fill larger areas with tone. And as you can see, it's <strong>erasable</strong>.</p>

<p>It feels a lot like <strong>willow or vine charcoal</strong>, which I also like to use during the early stages of painting to cover the canvas and block in the big shapes. But I don't really have the same degree of control with these sticks as with the PanPastel. They create more texture on the paper and they dust a lot more.</p>

<h3>Charcoal Pencils and Blending Stumps</h3>

<p>Then we have the <strong>charcoal pencils</strong>. These are soft, medium, and hard charcoal pencils. I mostly only use the hard one for signatures. Otherwise, I prefer the softer ones because they're easier to blend, and I use <strong>blending stumps</strong> for that.</p>

<p>By the way, I do have a <strong>white charcoal pencil</strong>, but I use it very sparingly and only for tiny little highlights. I mostly use the pencils for the fine details because I like a more <strong>painterly look</strong> to my charcoal drawings, where there isn't much line work except in the focal point of an image.</p>

<p>Looking at this painting, for example, this is a painting of a whale eye that I made, you can see that it's mostly composed of loose shadow shapes and some highlights, and just some pencil lines around the eye in the middle. These highlights I made with two types of eraser, by the way. So, let's look at them next.</p>

<h3>Erasers</h3>

<p>The best and most superior eraser of all, in my opinion, is the <strong>kneaded eraser</strong>. It's pure magic. You can mold it into any shape you want, a wedge shape for erasing thin lines or a fine point for erasing small areas. You can sweep it gently over an area to lighten it up, and you can dab it all over the paper to create interesting shapes and textures. I have done this here.</p>

<p>Whenever you need to clean it off, you just squish it like this, you drag it apart and sort of mold it back together, and it digests the charcoal into itself like magic. The best part about the kneaded eraser is that it doesn't leave anything behind, no dust or debris or little bits that you have to try to swipe away without ruining the drawing. You just gotta have one of these. They're amazing. And fortunately, they are very cheap.</p>

<p>But I also have one of these. This is a <strong>mechanical eraser</strong> with a very fine tip, and it's great for small, crisp highlights or lines. Erasing with it almost looks like you've drawn with white charcoal on top. I really love the control you have with this eraser, but it does leave residue that can be tricky to remove without smudging the drawing. So you definitely don't want to erase large areas with this.</p>

<h3>Paper</h3>

<p>Then we have <strong>paper</strong>. What type of paper do you use for charcoal? Well, I'm still experimenting with that. There's a lot more freedom than with water-based mediums, for sure.</p>

<p>My first charcoal drawings I made on just regular cheap sketching paper that was very smooth and pretty thin, 110 gsm, which is around 70 pounds, I think, and it worked fine. But the paper feels a little flimsy to me, so I recommend choosing a slightly thicker paper. This way, your finished pieces are not as fragile.</p>

<p>The paper I'm using here is 170 gsm, which I think is around 90 pounds. The most important aspect, though, is the <strong>texture</strong> of the paper. The more <strong>tooth or grain</strong> your paper has, the better the charcoal is going to stick to the paper, and the harder it will be to erase it. So it's kind of like a double-edged sword.</p>

<p>The paper I'm using here is actually very smooth, which is what gives it this almost airbrushed appearance, and the charcoal comes off easily with an eraser. But it's harder to get the deep darks to stick to the paper. I find that the PanPastel sticks very nicely to this paper, even though it's smooth, and it's erasable.</p>

<p>I made a lot of my earlier charcoal paintings on another type of paper with the same thickness but with more tooth. You can see the difference here. It has more of a grainy appearance, and it can hold a lot more of the compressed charcoal for these deep black areas. But I can't really get my highlights as bright and as crisp in this paper as on the smoother one.</p>

<p>I think it's just a matter of personal taste. If you're just starting out with charcoal, I recommend just trying out a bunch of different types of paper and textures and see what you like best. The only thing that I really can't recommend is drawing with charcoal in a <strong>sketchbook</strong>. I tried that once and it got really smudgy. As soon as I turned the page, the drawing was completely destroyed, and it had messed up a bunch of my other drawings as well. So, I mean, maybe if you put scrap pieces of paper to protect it or use a spray fixative, but I don't know. Until then, I prefer to work with charcoal on loose paper.</p>

<h2>My Process</h2>

<p>Now for the actual painting process. I'll walk you through one of my recent charcoal crows.</p>

<p>I like to start by <strong>toning the paper</strong>, and here I do that with some PanPastel, using one of those little sponges that I showed you. Working from a white canvas can make you a bit timid with your values, and make you not want to go that dark with your mid-tones and shadows, simply because the white of the paper is so bright. It can feel scary to deviate too much from it. But if we start from the mid-tones, if we tone the paper sort of halfway between light and dark, it's easier to go both ways, to go really dark on the shadows and to lift out the highlights with an eraser.</p>

<p>But to be honest, I really like white backgrounds. I do almost all of my watercolor paintings with a white background. I think it places more focus on the subject with no distracting background. But with charcoal, I just find it so fun and satisfying to tone the background.</p>

<p>Here, I'm going in with a <strong>kneaded eraser</strong>, lifting out the brighter parts of the subject. This is painting just as much as the charcoal, actually. It's like painting in reverse, going from dark to light. I use the erasers to orient myself and my subject to the page, and then I go in with the black pastel and I start carving out the basic shapes.</p>

<p>When I feel like I have an accurate base drawing, I go in with a <strong>charcoal pencil</strong> and I add more crispness to my darks. Charcoal pencil, since it's so compressed, is a lot harder to erase, so you want to be sure of yourself when you use them. I also use a <strong>blending stump</strong> to soften the edges and blend it together with the pastel.</p>

<p>Oh, and this is how I like to sharpen my charcoal pencils. I like to have quite a lot of the charcoal exposed, so that I can tilt the pencil and use the sides for shading. I use one of these <strong>utility knives</strong> - I think they're called - and I carve off about half an inch of the wood at the tip like this. You have to be careful, the tip might break off. Then, to make the surface even and smooth, I have a little block of <strong>sandpaper</strong> that I rub the tip over. Now I can draw fine lines, and I can do some even shading with the pencil. It's pretty neat.</p>

<p>Then I work back and forth with the charcoal and the erasers. This is what feels so luxurious to me, who's used to the limiting aspects of watercolors, because I can work from light to dark, or like here, from dark to light and back and forth. Everything is erasable, everything is moldable, and I can keep tweaking until I'm happy.</p>

<p>But that is because I've carefully selected my <strong>paper and material combo</strong>, because when I first started working with charcoal, I used a more textured paper and I only used compressed charcoal, like the crayons and the pencils, and I had very little control. I could barely erase my lines at all, and I could not get a smooth blend of the background. It was really frustrating. But then I learned that there were different types of charcoal and that <strong>willow charcoal and vine charcoal</strong> were the erasable types, and I also tried other types of paper, and then suddenly I was a lot freer in my process.</p>

<p>You know, it takes time to get to know a new art medium. Sometimes you don't like it right away. Sometimes it's introduced to you in the wrong way, or you're not using the right tools or materials, or you're using the right stuff but you're using it wrong. Yeah, it's a learning-by-doing process.</p>

<p>Here, I'm using one of my own little contraptions based on tools that I've seen painters use. It's like a long stick to rest your hand on so that you don't put your hand in the paint. Some pencil artists use a piece of scrap paper for this, but that doesn't really work for me with charcoal. It's way too easy to smudge the painting with the scrap paper.</p>

<p>I try to work from left to right when I'm drawing or painting, just so that I can rest my hand on the blank paper or the sketch. But sometimes you just gotta go back in there, and you don't want to smudge the drawing with your hand. So I created this stick. It's from an old brush that I attached a little wooden ball to, with some tissue paper around it. Actually, I don't know why I have the tissue around it, since it just soaks up the charcoal. I should remove that. Note to self.</p>

<p>And after quite a bit of back and forth, I hereby declare this crow done.</p>

<h2>Final Touches and Fixative</h2>

<p>But that doesn't mean that my work is done just yet, because with charcoal there's one last step, and it's pretty important if you want to be able to store or frame or do anything with your drawings without smudging them. I'm talking about <strong>fixative</strong>. You need to fix your drawings to kind of seal the charcoal onto the paper. It's still going to smudge a bit if you really rub your fingers on it, but not nearly as much as without spray fixative.</p>

<p>This, to me, is the least fun part about charcoal. I really don't like toxic stuff, especially toxic stuff that smells bad and gets in your airways. You absolutely should not breathe spray fixative, and you should not use it indoors. But I live in Sweden, and I don't always want to go outside in like a snowstorm with my drawings. So my solution is to go down to the basement.</p>

<p>Here's my little <strong>fixative station</strong> in the basement, just a piece of cardboard on the floor in a pretty well-ventilated area. I take a deep breath, I spray a thin layer on my drawings, and then I run upstairs, and I wait five to ten minutes. Then I hold my breath, I run downstairs, and I spray on another coat. I run upstairs again and wait another ten minutes, then I collect my drawings. I know I could probably do more layers, but two is good enough for me.</p>

<p>You could, of course, also use a breathing mask when doing this, or if you have an enclosed space outside where your drawings won't blow away or get wet, that would be ideal. But, you know, we work with what we have.</p>

<p>To be honest, I don't fix a lot of my charcoal drawings. I just pile them on top of one another and let them be a little smudgy. I'm not overly precious with my practice drawings, especially not if I've photographed them before I stash them away, which I usually do. But the pieces that I'm really proud of and want to protect, I usually spray with two coats of fixative, and then I keep them in a plastic sleeve in a portfolio like this, or in a folder.</p>

<p>That's pretty much everything I know about charcoal so far. I hope it was informative and that it inspired you to try out this beautiful medium yourself. If you have any charcoal-related questions, do ask them in the comments below.</p>

<p>Thank you so much for spending time with me today, and I'll see you in the next video.</p>
