<h2>The Core Problem</h2>

<p>chat GPT5 is not writing for people. It was trained with reinforcement learning from AI feedback, so it optimizes to impress other AIs. That pushes it toward <strong>complexity, abstraction, longer length</strong>, and the illusion that <strong>fancy words equal quality</strong>. Research even showed it rated gibberish with big words as high-quality writing. When you ask it to “think harder” or turn on heavy reasoning, it doubles down on that AI-to-AI optimization and gets less human friendly.</p>

<h2>A Quick Before and After</h2>

<p>Default prompt: “Write a professional email…” Result: generic, corporate speak. It reads like a template and gets trashed.</p>

<p>Jailbroken prompt: I force <strong>less thinking</strong> and <strong>extreme concision</strong>. I give exact <strong>constraints</strong>: opening, context, close. I add <strong>forbidden words</strong> (solutions, leverage, optimize, etc.), require <strong>agency name twice</strong>, a <strong>specific metric</strong>, a <strong>set meeting length</strong>, a <strong>max sentence count</strong>, and a <strong>reading level</strong>. Result: short, specific, human. Example shape: “We helped a similar agency cut delays by 27%. Worth a 15-minute conversation?” Verify numbers and never copy-paste blindly.</p>

<h2>Three Principles to Reprogram Style</h2>

<ul>

<li><strong>Constraints over collaboration.</strong> Do not ask it to “sound professional” or “be persuasive.” Direct it like an actor: “Write 3 sentences. Use the company name twice. Include one percentage. End with a question.” Constraints bypass its internal sophistication meter.</li>

<li><strong>Minimize reasoning to maximize human connection.</strong> High reasoning is AI perfectionism. Minimal reasoning is <strong>directness</strong>. Use low reasoning when you want clear, plain writing.</li>

<li><strong>Eliminate vs add.</strong> Do not add “be conversational and engaging.” That creates conflicts. Instead, forbid trigger words, ban passive voice, cap sentence count, and restrict syllables. Removing complexity makes complexity impossible.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Routing Signals Matter</h2>

<p>chat GPT5 is a <strong>router</strong>. Prompts like “professional,” “persuasive,” or “think step by step” route to complex, academic modes. Trigger <strong>efficiency</strong> instead: “Quick response needed.” Routing explains inconsistent outputs and why chats drift over time.</p>

<h2>What to Practice</h2>

<ul>

<li>Write one <strong>human-sounding email</strong> that feels like a breath of fresh air.</li>

<li>Extra credit: <strong>Rewrite</strong> the worst generic AI text using elimination rules.</li>

<li>For teams: co-create a reusable prompt with constraints, then train everyone to use it.</li>
