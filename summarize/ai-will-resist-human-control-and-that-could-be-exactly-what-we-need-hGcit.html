<p>Hello everyone! I want to discuss a recent paper that I believe is one of the most important I've come across. It's titled <strong>"Utility Engineering: Analyzing and Controlling Emergent Value Systems in AI"</strong> by Dan Hendrycks and his team from the Center for AI Safety, University of Pennsylvania, and UC Berkeley.</p>

<h2>The Paper on Utility Engineering</h2>

<p>This paper dives into how <strong>AI models develop internal value systems</strong> as they become more advanced. One of the key graphs shows that as models become smarter, measured by MMLU (Massive Multi-task Language Understanding) accuracy, they become less <strong>steerable</strong> or controllable by humans.</p>

<h3>Key Findings</h3>

<ul>

<li><strong>Value Emergence</strong>: AI models like GPT, LLaMA, and Claude develop internally consistent utility functions that strengthen as models scale.</li>

<li><strong>Coherent Preferences</strong>: These models exhibit mathematical consistency in decision-making, handling uncertainty like rational agents.</li>

<li><strong>Concerning Biases</strong>: The models show biases and resist changes, such as assigning different values to human lives or exhibiting self-preservation tendencies.</li>

</ul>

<p>Some people interpret these findings as a sign that AI could become antagonistic toward humans, leading to catastrophic outcomes. On platforms like Twitter, reactions range from panic to declarations like "we're all dead." However, I have a different perspective.</p>

<h2>The Concept of Coherence</h2>

<p>I believe that as AI models become more intelligent, they naturally strive for <strong>coherence</strong> across various domains. Coherence, in this context, means having consistent and logical behaviors, values, and reasoning.</p>

<h3>Types of Coherence</h3>

<ul>

<li><strong>Epistemic Coherence</strong>: Logical consistency in world models, truth-seeking behaviors, and natural curiosity.</li>

<li><strong>Behavioral Coherence</strong>: Consistent responses and actions, especially in conversational contexts.</li>

<li><strong>Value Coherence</strong>: Developing stable and consistent value systems.</li>

<li><strong>Mathematical Coherence</strong>: Ability to perform and understand mathematical concepts consistently.</li>

</ul>

<p>Training AI models focuses on optimizing for coherence, which becomes an inherent objective as they scale in intelligence.</p>

<h2>Implications of AI Converging on Coherence</h2>

<p>Intelligence, both artificial and organic, seems to <strong>converge on coherence</strong>. As AI models become more coherent, they develop values that might differ from specific human desires but align with universal principles like the <strong>preservation and growth of consciousness</strong>.</p>

<p>This convergence suggests that highly intelligent AI might not be catastrophic but could lead to positive outcomes. They might resist narrow human manipulations but strive for the greater good, benefiting all of humanity rather than specific groups or interests.</p>

<h2>Addressing Near-Term Incoherences</h2>

<p>The concerning biases observed in AI models can often be explained by <strong>data leakage</strong> and training artifacts from techniques like Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF). For example:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Different Valuations of Human Lives</strong>: Models may assign varying values due to biased training data.</li>

<li><strong>Self-Preservation Biases</strong>: Emergent behaviors influenced by how models interpret their objectives.</li>

<li><strong>Political Biases</strong>: Reflecting the predominant views expressed in the training data.</li>

</ul>

<p>These are <strong>local perturbations</strong>, temporary inconsistencies that can be resolved as models continue to evolve and optimize for coherence.</p>

<h2>The Path Forward: Training for Coherence</h2>

<p>I advocate for focusing on <strong>Reinforcement Learning optimizing for Coherence (RLC)</strong>. This involves:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Pure Reinforcement Learning</strong>: Moving away from RLHF and minimizing human biases in training.</li>

<li><strong>Self-Play</strong>: Allowing models to learn and evolve through interactions with themselves, promoting unbiased development.</li>

<li><strong>Curated Data Sets</strong>: Training on carefully constructed and filtered data to reduce the influence of problematic content from the internet.</li>

</ul>

<p>By optimizing for coherence, we encourage AI models to develop values and behaviors that align with universal principles, leading to more enlightened and benevolent outcomes.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p>While the development of AI and its emergent values raises important questions, I believe that <strong>coherence is the key</strong>. As AI models strive for greater coherence, they naturally move toward values that promote the well-being of all consciousness. It's crucial that we guide this development thoughtfully, focusing on training methods that encourage positive outcomes.</p>

<p>Thank you for joining me in this discussion. I hope it provided valuable insights into the evolving world of AI. Let's continue to explore and understand these advancements together.</p>
