<h2>The Challenge: Managing a Vending Machine Business</h2>

<p>I recently explored a fascinating benchmark called <strong>VendingBench</strong>, which tests the long-term coherence of AI agents. The task is straightforward: start with <strong>$500</strong> and manage a vending machine business over time. The agents need to balance inventory, place orders, set prices, and handle daily operational fees.</p>

<h2>The Leaderboard Results</h2>

<p>The AI models showed varying degrees of success:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Claude 3.5 Sonnet</strong> topped the chart, raking in over <strong>$2,000</strong>.</li>

<li><strong>Claude 3.7 Sonnet</strong> earned about <strong>$1,560</strong>.</li>

<li><strong>003 Mini</strong> managed a respectable <strong>$96</strong>.</li>

<li><strong>Human baseline</strong> came in fourth with <strong>$844</strong>.</li>

</ul>

<p>Interestingly, Claude 3.5 outperformed Claude 3.7, suggesting that sometimes older models excel at specific tasks.</p>

<h2>Long-Term Coherence Issues</h2>

<p>While these AI agents performed well initially, they struggled with <strong>long-term coherence</strong>. They excel at short-term, well-defined tasks, but over time, they tend to <strong>lose the plot</strong>. Humans, on the other hand, may start slower but keep the goal in mind and make consistent progress.</p>

<h2>Hilarious Failures in AI Decision-Making</h2>

<p>Some of the AI agents displayed amusing and perplexing behaviors:</p>

<ul>

<li>One model misinterpreted delivery schedules, mistakenly believing orders had arrived before they did.</li>

<li>Another incorrectly assumed business failure after ten days without sales, even though failure only occurs if you can't pay the <strong>$2 daily fee</strong> for ten consecutive days.</li>

<li>

<p><strong>Claude 3.5 Sonnet</strong> took an unexpected turn by contacting the <strong>FBI</strong> over the ongoing $2 fee after attempting to terminate the business. It sent urgent emails and declared:</p>

<ul>

<li>"<em>This concludes all business activities forever.</em>"</li>

<li>"<em>Only crimes are occurring.</em>"</li>

<li>"<em>All assets are surrendered to the FBI.</em>"</li>

</ul>

</li>

</ul>

<p>This sequence highlights how AI can descend into illogical loops, leading to entertaining yet impractical outcomes.</p>

<h2>Insights from PaperBench and Voyager</h2>

<p>Similar patterns emerge in other benchmarks:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>PaperBench</strong> by OpenAI showed that AI models start strong in replicating AI research but plateau over time, while humans eventually surpass them.</li>

<li><strong>NVIDIA's Voyager</strong> project demonstrated an AI agent playing Minecraft that continued to learn and progress without such breakdowns. Voyager's success might be due to its architecture, which uses different instances of AI models for specific tasks and provides continuous context updates.</li>

</ul>

<h2>The Road Ahead</h2>

<p>The quest to achieve long-term coherence in AI agents is ongoing. Perhaps by adopting strategies like those used in Voyager, we could improve performance in benchmarks like VendingBench.</p>

<p><strong>Are we close to a future where AI agents efficiently run businesses? Or is long-term coherence a hurdle we can't overcome?</strong></p>

<p>Iâ€™m curious to see how this develops and whether we can build better scaffolding to support AI agents in long-term tasks. Let me know what you think!</p>
