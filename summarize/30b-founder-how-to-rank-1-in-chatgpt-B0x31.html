<h2>Inbound Origins and Movement-Building</h2>

<p>Dharmesh and Brian noticed a gap: well-funded startups with CMOs could not get the traffic Dharmesh’s personal blog was getting. That insight led to <strong>inbound marketing</strong>: add value before you try to extract it. They built a community first, product second.</p>

<p>Key moves:

- Blog obsessively, teach everything, and let SEO compound.

- Create a neutral, industry-wide gathering. The first “Inbound” was 200 people in a Marriott, not a HubSpot commercial. They never trademarked “inbound marketing” so the idea could spread.

- Category creation works when we build a <strong>movement</strong> around a better way, then offer tools that naturally fit. Think ClickFunnels with “funnels,” or Brian Johnson’s longevity “don’t die” ethos.</p>

<p>Communities reduce market inefficiency. By connecting people who should know each other, we unlock latent value and benefit from network effects.</p>

<h2>Marketing Eras to Now: SEO to Algojacking to AEO</h2>

<p>We’ve seen waves:

- <strong>SEO era</strong>: win with content that deserves to rank. Google rewards clean structure, fast pages, and genuinely useful answers.

- <strong>Paid ads era</strong>: rent attention, but the second you turn off spend, the traffic stops.

- <strong>Algojacking</strong>: build exactly what the platform wants. Steve Bartlett designed content for social algorithms and later shaped Diary of a CEO to what YouTube/Instagram reward. MrBeast does this for views.

- <strong>Now: AEO (Answer Engine Optimization)</strong>. Users ask ChatGPT instead of clicking “10 blue links.” Organic traffic is down 20 to 40 percent in many categories. AEO is a more binary game: either we appear in the answer and citations, or we don’t.</p>

<h2>AEO Playbook: What We Do Now</h2>

<ul>

<li><strong>Allow AI crawlers</strong>: make sure OpenAI’s SearchBot and GPTBot are not blocked.</li>

<li><strong>Measure AI referrals</strong>: track AI source parameters in analytics to see baselines and lift.</li>

<li><strong>Structure for answers</strong>: reframe content in clear, question-and-answer form. Make it the best possible answer to the query.</li>

<li><strong>Keep white-hat SEO</strong>: authority, links, fast pages, and evergreen depth still matter, since ChatGPT federates through Bing before composing answers.</li>

<li><strong>Ecommerce specifics</strong>: use structured product data (sizes, color, inventory, delivery).</li>

<li><strong>Social proof signals</strong>: review sites and Reddit threads with clear, upvoted answers get cited often.</li>

<li><strong>Own your land</strong>: content compounds for years, ads don’t.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Mindset: Intensity, Iteration, Builder Energy</h2>

<p>Dharmesh’s edge is not being the smartest. It’s more <strong>iterations</strong> and higher <strong>volume</strong>. More is more. Early blogs drew 4 reads, then 6, then 5. Keep going. Pick a domain you enjoy so you can sustain the reps for years.</p>

<p>His “algebra” for building: start at n = 1, then always make it true for n + 1. Don’t cling to a fixed idea. Iterate with real feedback.</p>

<p>Final vibe: dance like no one’s watching, build like everyone’s waiting.</p>
