<h2>Using Tariffs as Negotiation Tools</h2>

<p>I've been observing how President Trump is <strong>implementing tariffs</strong> not to harm the global economy but to <strong>gain leverage</strong> in trade negotiations. By applying <strong>targeted pressure</strong>, he's pushing foreign nations to <strong>engage in fair trade practices</strong>.</p>

<h2>Positive Responses from Other Nations</h2>

<p>Countries like <strong>Vietnam</strong> are reacting swiftly. After the tariffs, Vietnam expressed willingness to <strong>reduce tariffs to zero</strong> on U.S. imports. This shows me that when the U.S. asserts itself, others are ready to <strong>negotiate</strong>.</p>

<h2>Media Misconceptions</h2>

<p>I notice the media often portrays Trump's actions as reckless, forecasting economic disaster. They ignore that the U.S. holds a strong position. For example, <strong>China exports much more to the U.S.</strong> than it imports, meaning they have more to lose in a trade war.</p>

<h2>Emphasizing Reciprocity</h2>

<p>From my perspective, the strategy is about <strong>reciprocity</strong>. The U.S. has been <strong>defending and subsidizing</strong> other nations, only to face <strong>trade barriers</strong>. Now, Trump insists that if other countries don't <strong>drop their tariffs</strong>, the U.S. will impose its own. As <strong>Stephen Miller</strong> noted, this addresses systemic trade injustices.</p>

<h2>Protecting National Interests</h2>

<p>I believe this isn't about unrealistic goals but about <strong>securing vital industries</strong> like steel and technology. By <strong>regaining control of supply chains</strong>, the U.S. reduces dependence on foreign nations and bolsters its <strong>national security</strong>.</p>
