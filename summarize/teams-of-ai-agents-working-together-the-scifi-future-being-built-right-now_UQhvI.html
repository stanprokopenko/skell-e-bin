<p>Tatiana's startup, Wayfound AI, focuses on AI agents. These AI agents have two main capabilities: <strong>interaction</strong> and <strong>autonomous action</strong>. Interaction modality allows communication with the AI agent, often referred to as a chatbot. The agent can be trained, given access to systems, and take actions independently. AI agents are named for their role in the principal-agent problem and their ability to make decisions (agency).</p>

<h2>Capabilities of AI Agents</h2>

<p><strong>Interaction modality</strong> allows communication with the AI agent, often referred to as a chatbot. The agent can be trained, given access to systems, and take actions independently. This new AI technology is <strong>groundbreaking</strong> because it can generate new insights and recommendations autonomously.</p>

<h2>Effective Implementation</h2>

<p>Effective implementation of AI agents requires <strong>robust communication</strong> and <strong>autonomous decision-making capabilities</strong>. Wayfound AI focuses on <strong>onboarding, training, managing, and supervising AI agents</strong> to make them reliable and trustworthy. Early adopters of AI technology were often disappointed because they expected expert-level performance but got naive interns. Wayfound AI aims to transform these AI interns into reliable workers through <strong>supervision and feedback</strong>.</p>

<h2>Value of AI Agents</h2>

<p>The real value of AI agents lies in <strong>creating new customer experiences</strong>, not just cost-cutting. <strong>Trust in AI technology</strong> is crucial for deploying it in customer-facing operations. Businesses are using AI to <strong>innovate and create new market opportunities</strong>. Tatiana stresses the importance of using AI to innovate and create new market opportunities, not just replicate existing processes at a lower cost. Companies that innovate with AI will be more successful than those that only focus on cost-cutting. The goal is to enable companies to innovate and create new customer-facing products with AI. The conversation highlights the need for a shift in thinking towards creating new experiences with AI.</p>

<h2>Challenges and Enterprise Adoption</h2>

<p>Chad mentions the importance of addressing <strong>enterprise-level concerns</strong> like <strong>security, compliance, and observability</strong> for AI deployment. Even with advanced models, it will take time to implement and integrate them safely and effectively. The challenge is making AI <strong>enterprise-ready</strong>, addressing needs seen a year and a half ago.</p>

<p>Building enterprise-ready AI involves creating <strong>admin controls, auditability, compliance</strong>, and other necessary features. The process will be <strong>multi-year</strong> but essential for business deployment. The speaker spent six years at Box, helping build their platform business during the early cloud adoption phase. Initial resistance to cloud adoption was due to security, cost, and existing infrastructure concerns. Over time, most companies have adopted cloud solutions. <strong>AI adoption is expected to follow a similar trajectory</strong>.</p>

<h2>Recent Advancements and Accessibility</h2>

<p>Recent advancements, like <strong>GPT-40 mini</strong>, have significantly reduced costs, making AI more accessible. The cost of intelligence is approaching zero, leading to massive network effects and real-time system interactions.</p>

<p>The <strong>open source vs. closed source debate</strong> is crucial. Open source models are becoming more accessible, but closed source models may offer better total cost of ownership and risk management. Companies using open source models in enterprise contexts often spend millions to make them production-ready.</p>

<p><strong>Trust, safety, and security</strong> are major concerns for enterprises adopting AI. The key to success will be delivering on trust, similar to the reliability required for utilities like power. Technology should be reliable like a light switch, with trust being as important as functionality. Accountability, legal liability, and financial risk are significant considerations for enterprises. Enterprises conduct cost-benefit analyses to weigh the benefits of AI against potential risks.</p>

<h2>Real-World Applications</h2>

<p>Wayfound focuses on use cases involving <strong>large amounts of textual information</strong> from multiple sources. AI agents can process and intertwine vast amounts of information in real-time, providing comprehensive interactions with humans. For example, one customer has a real-time product catalog from a database that changes constantly. They have a base level of knowledge about their business and specific customer information. Customers can ask detailed questions about past programs, successes, competitors, and new initiatives. The agent can provide <strong>customer-specific answers</strong> to broad and specific questions 24/7.</p>

<p>Thousands of agents can be deployed simultaneously to meet business needs. This technology meets real business needs without requiring AGI, showcasing its power. The problem addressed is providing real-time information on social good platforms for customers with extra marketing budgets. Traditionally, coordinating experts and producing reports took days, but now an agent can do it in real time. The agent knows the customer's background, past programs, customer base, and market. Expert agents on specific topics can be accessed by the customer agent to create a plan quickly. This new customer experience is more robust, accurate, and faster than human coordination.</p>

<h2>New Business Opportunities</h2>

<p>Handling large-scale information quickly enables new opportunities. Agents can encapsulate specific knowledge and directives, creating a network of intelligence. This network allows agents to answer specific questions by accessing vast amounts of context. The technology enables new experiences that were previously infeasible due to speed and error rates.</p>

<h2>Infrastructure and Future Capabilities</h2>

<p>Wayfound builds the necessary infrastructure, like <strong>air traffic control and instrumentation</strong>, to unlock these capabilities. The focus is on <strong>creating new experiences rather than replacing jobs</strong>. Agents will eventually spend more time interacting with each other than with humans. Observability is crucial for deploying agents that can manipulate data within a business.</p>

<p>Trends indicate that <strong>reasoning capabilities in models</strong> are becoming more important. Future capabilities may include <strong>enhanced reasoning and understanding of tools and their applications</strong>. The latest model from Anthropic can perform <strong>sequential tool calling</strong>. The model shows behind-the-scenes reasoning during inference. For example, an API to get a list of users and another to get user details. The model can invoke tools in parallel if there are no dependencies. For complex queries, the model reasons and invokes tools sequentially. Current OpenAI models can't perform sequential tool invocation.</p>

<p>We are at the beginning of <strong>deep understanding at the model level</strong>. Traditional workflow tools mix AI with old-school programming. Future models will reason and invoke tools without explicit programming. Generative AI will solve problems without step-by-step constraints. Companies trusting AI intelligence will gain new insights.</p>

<h2>Manager Model and Global Intelligence Network</h2>

<p>Chad and the engineering team built the first <strong>manager model</strong> for AI agents. This model <strong>supervises other AI agents</strong>, ensuring they take correct actions. The manager model has better judgment and context about the company, aligning AI agents with <strong>company values and goals</strong>. Global directives are used to embed company values and ethics, and the manager model learns from human feedback and organizational context.</p>

<p>Wayfound allows building and managing AI agents on its platform, supporting integration with external agents via APIs. The new paradigm involves learning at both human and system levels. Chad hopes for a <strong>global intelligence network</strong> for AI agents. The <strong>Open Agent Alliance</strong> aims to open and connect AI agent networks globally. Shared protocols and observability are crucial for global intelligence. The analogy to Moore's law suggests AI will advance through networking, not just raw power.</p>

<p>Tatiana compares the <strong>AI revolution to the advent of electricity</strong>. For widespread AI adoption, <strong>standards and interoperability</strong> are needed. The conversation highlights the <strong>excitement and potential of AI progress</strong>.</p>
