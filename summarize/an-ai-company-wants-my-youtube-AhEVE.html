<h2>The Rise of AI Art and Recent Events</h2>

<p>There's been a lot happening with AI art lately. OpenAI's new model sparked a wave of memes, some of them extremely distasteful, using styles from studios like Studio Ghibli. These AI-generated images have even reached high levels of influence, and they are sometimes used as propaganda. Reactions vary widely, especially between artists and those who view it as a novelty.</p>

<p>Within our art community, some creators have engaged with AI in ways that sparked controversy. I've mostly stayed silent because others have covered the basics, and people have entrenched themselves in their positions. However, I want to address something that hasn't been widely discussed.</p>

<h2>An Unwelcome Proposal from RHEI</h2>

<p>A few weeks ago, I received an email from a company called RHEI. They offered to pay me for the rights to use all of my YouTube content to license and sell to AI companies for training models. They pitched it as an "exciting opportunity," mentioning an investment of <strong>$35 million in creators</strong> like me. According to them, my channel, with its hundreds of hours of content, could be worth <strong>$52,570</strong>, with an initial deal unlocking about <strong>$6,000</strong>.</p>

<p>Their terms were expansive, granting them the right to use my content <strong>"in any manner and in or on any form, method, platform, or media now known or hereafter devised throughout the universe"</strong> for AI development.</p>

<h2>My Firm Stance Against Licensing</h2>

<p>I didn't respond to their email directly, but here's my official answer: <strong>Absolutely not.</strong> I have no interest in working with companies that want to use my content to train AI models. I believe their work is making the world a worse place, and I urge them to reconsider their path.</p>

<p>To any peers thinking I might be burning bridges with future "AI overlords," I stand by my decision. If others wish to compromise their artistic integrity and careers by engaging with such companies, that's their choice, but it's not one I support.</p>

<h2>Concerns About Other Creators</h2>

<p>At a recent gathering, I spoke with a fellow content creator, a documentary filmmaker, who received a similar offer. She considered accepting it, reasoning, **"If I'm going to get affected by AI anyway, I might as well make money from it." ** While I understand that line of thinking, I strongly disagree.</p>

<p>These offers can be misleading. The proposed amounts sound significant, but payments depend on whether clients license your content, and rates vary. Moreover, accepting these deals perpetuates a system that undermines artists by enabling middlemen to profit from our work.</p>

<h2>A Call to Action for Artists</h2>

<p>Artists, <strong>if this isn't our fight, what is?</strong> Protecting the dignity of human-made art and the personal journey each artist undertakes is crucial. The encroachment of automated machine art threatens the essence of our creativity.</p>

<p>I urge fellow artists not to fall for these tempting offers. Standing firm against such practices is vital for the future of our community. Let's not justify inaction by convincing ourselves that adopting these tools is acceptable.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>

<p>The current landscape is confusing, with many trying to blur the lines and create a "gray area." But the reality is clear, we have the right to oppose the misuse of our work. Let's set our shoulders back and fight for what we believe in. **We don't have to roll over, we can stand strong together. **</p>
