<h2>A Moment of Recognition</h2>

<p>Recently, I was at the dermatologist's office for a routine skin check. After the appointment, a doctor in training thanked me for helping them with anatomy and physiology. This kind of recognition happens to me all the time, and while it makes me happy, it also brings up other emotions.</p>

<h2>The Invisible Team</h2>

<p>I feel a need to explain that <strong>Crash Course</strong> isn't just me. It's a dedicated team of dozens who work tirelessly to design curriculum, write scripts, add jokes, create animations, design sets, and edit videos. All that invisible work is what makes Crash Course actually good. Part of what makes it effective is that the work isn't very visible, we want people learning without distractions.</p>

<h2>The Impact of Crash Course</h2>

<p>Crash Course is an extremely useful tool for teachers and students. A recent report by the American Historical Association lists Crash Course as the second most popular resource for history teachers in the U.S., after government institutions. It's also watched by people who aren't currently in school, just to better understand their world. Education is the second-largest industry in this country, with costs and value in the trillions of dollars per year. Yet, Crash Course operates on a budget less than a single 22-minute sitcom episode.</p>

<h2>The Power of a Few</h2>

<p>What surprises me is how few people it takes to make a significant impact. There are strategies where a very small number of people can have a truly insane impact. With Crash Course, we have found the right place to push. We've got the lever and the fulcrum in place, we just need the weight. And in this case, we don't need the weight from everybody, just from those who can contribute.</p>

<h2>Focusing on Value</h2>

<p>We don't make schools pay for Crash Course, which has huge benefits. It means teachers decide whether to use it, and Crash Course lives or dies by whether it provides value to teachers and students. Our only goal is to spend time and resources on creating value for learners.</p>

<h2>The Long-Term Commitment</h2>

<p>Small groups of people can truly effect tremendous change, but you need a few things. First, you need <strong>long-term focus</strong>, you can't just be in and out. Second, you need to <strong>care a lot</strong>, so much that it's not always pleasant. But most importantly, you've got to <strong>find the right place to push</strong>, and when you find it, you have to keep pushing.</p>

<h2>Gratitude</h2>

<p>Ultimately, we have a powerful, successful, impactful, and financially sustainable Crash Course because of people who have taken the time to consider whether they can support it in some way. So, <strong>thank you</strong>. Your consideration makes a difference.</p>
