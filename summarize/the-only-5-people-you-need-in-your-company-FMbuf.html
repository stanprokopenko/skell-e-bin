<p>Small teams with the right people don't just compete with giants, they take them down. Companies like Facebook, Microsoft, and Airbnb all started with five people or fewer. To replicate their success, you need the right team. Here are the five essential roles to build a successful company.</p>

<h2>The Analyst</h2>

<p>As the founder, you're the <strong>Analyst</strong>. Understand the numbers, spot patterns, and anticipate problems. Know your revenue, costs, efficiencies, bottlenecks, and scalability. Without this insight, you can't make informed decisions.</p>

<p>Most founders love their product, but they don't understand their business. Don't be like them. Track key metrics. <strong>The numbers never lie</strong>. You can't outsource this role, not yet. You must know your business better than anyone.</p>

<h2>The Operator</h2>

<p>Your second hire is the <strong>Operator</strong>. They handle day-to-day operations so you can focus on growth. They manage people, systems, and processes without needing constant input. The Operator is the glue that holds everything together and might become your COO.</p>

<p>Choose someone who complements your skills and shares your vision. They should challenge your ideas, ask the right questions, and work well with you.</p>

<h2>The Builder</h2>

<p>Next, bring in the <strong>Builder</strong>. They create your product or service, turning ideas into reality. They're experts in their craft, more knowledgeable than you, but not interested in running a business. They focus solely on building the best version of your offering.</p>

<p>The Builder challenges your assumptions and pushes for excellence. They need the space, tools, and freedom to create. They're the difference between an average product and one people can't stop talking about.</p>

<h2>The Seller</h2>

<p>As your company grows, you'll need a <strong>Seller</strong>. Initially, you might handle sales, but to scale, you need someone specialized. The Seller turns interest into revenue. They understand human psychology, pricing strategies, and how to overcome objections.</p>

<p>They sell not just a product but <strong>certainty</strong>. They shape the environment of the deal and handle pressure in any setting. The Seller understands your brand and customers, selling without cheapening your value.</p>

<h2>The Storyteller</h2>

<p>The <strong>Storyteller</strong> makes your company memorable. They create an emotional connection between your brand and your audience. They're responsible for how the world perceives your business.</p>

<p>The Storyteller understands people, culture, and identity, not just marketing tactics. They shape the narrative that makes your product more than just a commodity. With the right Storyteller, your company becomes unforgettable.</p>

<h2>The Big Hire</h2>

<p>When growth leads to chaos, it's time for the <strong>Big Hire</strong>. This is an expert specializing in the one area holding you back, operations, finance, product development, or systems design. Their deep knowledge breaks through obstacles, and propels you forward.</p>

<p>Bring them in at the right time, not too early, to maximize their impact. The Big Hire helps you smash through growth ceilings, and reach new heights.</p>
