<h2>Overwhelming Support After Quitting AI</h2>

<p>I recently announced that I'm <strong>quitting AI</strong>, and I wanted to reflect on this experience. People were overwhelmingly supportive, and it was heartening to see such positive reactions. Many were excited for me, and curious about what I'm passionate about next. There were very few negative responses, maybe one in a thousand, which was much less than I expected.</p>

<h2>Focusing on My Health</h2>

<p>One of my main reasons for this change is to <strong>focus on my health</strong>. I've struggled with chronic health issues, starting with burnout, which led to a cascade of problems. In 2017, I was hospitalized with <strong>acute pancreatitis</strong>. Looking back, I realize that burnout contributed to this and other chronic gut health issues.</p>

<p>After getting treated for <strong>H. pylori</strong> two months ago, I've seen significant improvements. I'm out here in the woods six days a week, and my sleep has dramatically improved. If you struggle with anxiety, depression, or chronic issues, I recommend starting with your <strong>gut health</strong>. As Hippocrates said, "All disease begins in the gut." Look at your diet, consult a dietitian, and consider getting a stool test.</p>

<h2>Connection Between Physical Health and Mental Well-being</h2>

<p>As my health improved, my <strong>anxiety disappeared</strong>, and my outlook changed. I became less worried about the future and more present. This shift also changed my perspective on AI safety conversations. I started questioning the fear-mongering around AI and found those discussions less meaningful.</p>

<h2>Boredom with the Current AI Conversation</h2>

<p>With more people entering the AI conversation, the level of sophistication has <strong>regressed to the mean</strong>. When discussions become less intellectually stimulating, it leads to boredom. I realized I wasn't interested in talking about AI in this context anymore. It's not that AI isn't important, it's that the conversations have become repetitive and uninspiring.</p>

<h2>Embracing New Directions</h2>

<p>Two new areas have captured my interest:</p>

<h3>Focusing on the Economics of the Future</h3>

<p>I believe it's not inevitable that we'll end up in a utopian future. While technological advances are certain, the same can't be said for how we handle the <strong>economics of the future</strong>. Human stupidity and corruption can derail progress. I want to work on building consensus around shaping a better future, something that's not guaranteed.</p>

<h3>Advocating for Legalizing Psychedelics</h3>

<p>The second area is <strong>legalizing psychedelics</strong>. This powerful tool has the potential to be life-saving and life-changing, both spiritually and medically. It's not inevitable that psychedelics will become legal. There's decades of baggage from the past to overcome, especially from the war on drugs initiated by Richard Nixon. Psychedelics were made illegal because they encouraged people to question authority and oppose war. It's time to revisit this conversation and advocate for change.</p>
