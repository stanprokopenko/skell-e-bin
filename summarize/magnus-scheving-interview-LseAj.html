<p>In this interview, we are joined by <strong>Magnus Scheving</strong>, the creator of <strong>LazyTown</strong>. With LazyTown turning 30 years old this year, Magnus reflects on the journey of creating the show, its impact on children's health, and his plans for its future.</p>

<h2>Reacquiring LazyTown and Its Future</h2>

<p>Magnus recently <strong>reacquired the rights to LazyTown</strong>. This includes all episodes, the entire intellectual property, <strong>LazyTown Extra</strong>, and the music. He explains that the idea is to bring LazyTown back to life and continue its mission to move kids and promote health.</p>

<p>He mentions that in the early days, <strong>LazyTown was produced entirely in Iceland</strong>, with everything done under one roof, from sound recording to stunts, music, editing, and writing. The show reached <strong>almost 170 countries</strong>, translated into <strong>27 or 28 languages</strong>, and broadcasted into <strong>500 million homes</strong>.</p>

<p>However, despite its popularity, Magnus felt that LazyTown needed bigger support to expand globally. In 2012, Turner (Warner Bros.) bought the rights with plans to use LazyTown as the front of their preschool strategy. But after three years, they changed their strategy, and LazyTown ended up on a shelf, not moving forward. Magnus was determined to prevent LazyTown from being stagnant, so he worked to bring it back home.</p>

<p>Now that he has regained control, Magnus believes that <strong>LazyTown is even more relevant today</strong> than it was 30 years ago. He notes that the kids who grew up watching LazyTown are now parents themselves and understand its value. His main mission is to get LazyTown back to work and continue inspiring kids to be active and healthy.</p>

<h2>The Origin and Vision of LazyTown</h2>

<p>Magnus shares that since he was a child, he has always been busy and active. He noticed changes in children's health over the years, with more kids having diseases like <strong>diabetes</strong>, <strong>lupus</strong>, <strong>food allergies</strong>, and <strong>asthma</strong>. He rarely saw children with such conditions when he was young.</p>

<p>His vision for LazyTown was to <strong>move kids and change the industry</strong> because he believes that we are <strong>"sickening our kids" with bad food</strong>. He wanted to promote health and physical activity through the show. However, in the beginning, there were <strong>no healthy products</strong> or merchandise associated with children's shows.</p>

<p>LazyTown was designed to be a <strong>trustworthy program for kids</strong>, focusing on health without associating with fast-food companies or unhealthy products. Despite the challenges, parents and fans loved the show because of its positive message.</p>

<h2>Challenges in Producing LazyTown</h2>

<h3>The Production Process and Team</h3>

<p>Producing LazyTown was a massive undertaking. The show was shot with puppets, live actors, stunts, green screens, and special effects, all within one building in Iceland. The team included <strong>160 people working like a well-oiled machine</strong>.</p>

<p>Magnus was not only the creator but also took on multiple roles, including acting as <strong>Sportacus</strong>, directing, writing, and even editing. He explains that he hadn't planned to direct or write the show, but circumstances led him to take on these roles. The initial writers and directors struggled with the unique challenges of the show, so Magnus stepped in to ensure that his vision was realized.</p>

<h3>Doing Multiple Roles</h3>

<p>Playing Sportacus was physically demanding. The costume was <strong>very warm</strong> , and performing stunts in it was challenging. Magnus recalls that the <strong>mustache was a particular challenge</strong>, it had to stay on during flips and stunts, which sometimes gave him headaches due to its tightness.</p>

<p>Balancing acting and directing was also difficult. While in costume, Magnus would direct scenes, sometimes forgetting that he needed to be in front of the camera himself. He often didn't have time to <strong>warm up before performing stunts</strong>, which took a toll on his body over time.</p>

<h3>Working with Puppets</h3>

<p>Working with puppets added another layer of complexity. The puppeteers had to perform with their <strong>arms raised</strong>, looking down at monitors, while ensuring that the puppets moved naturally. The puppets were human characters, which made their movements more challenging than animal puppets.</p>

<p>Magnus praises the puppeteers, saying they were <strong>outstanding</strong> and that their work was <strong>brilliant</strong>. He acknowledges that the show required enormous training and effort from them to make the characters come alive.</p>

<h2>Fan Interactions and Impact</h2>

<h3>Fan Engagement</h3>

<p>Magnus expresses deep appreciation for the <strong>fans of LazyTown</strong>. He notes that when the show was shelved by Turner, the fans stepped in to keep it alive. They wrote their own stories, drew pictures, and shared their love for the show online.</p>

<p>He believes that if LazyTown <strong>inspires someone to create something, that's fantastic</strong>. Magnus is happy that the fans have kept LazyTown alive and appreciates their support.</p>

<h3>Special Moments with Fans</h3>

<p>Magnus shares several memorable experiences with fans:</p>

<ul>

<li>

<p><strong>Mexico City:</strong> While traveling in Mexico, he saw a group performing a pirate version of LazyTown in a poor neighborhood. Despite safety concerns, he insisted on meeting them. The performers were initially worried they'd get in trouble, but Magnus joined them in their show, creating a memorable experience for everyone.</p>

</li>

<li>

<p><strong>Jenny's Story:</strong> A young girl named Jenny, who was undergoing chemotherapy, found joy in watching LazyTown. Her family arranged a visit to the set, and Magnus spent time with her. She has since grown up and is doing well.</p>

</li>

<li>

<p><strong>Autistic Children:</strong> Magnus recalls a live show in Iceland where he invited autistic children onto the stage. The parents were emotional because their children had never been on stage before. The show had a significant impact on them.</p>

</li>

</ul>

<p>He emphasizes that LazyTown has always had <strong>fantastic fans</strong>, and he has met many nice people through the show.</p>

<h2>The Relevance of LazyTown Today</h2>

<p>Magnus believes that LazyTown is <strong>more relevant now than ever</strong>. With increasing health issues among children, such as obesity and chronic diseases, promoting healthy lifestyles is crucial.</p>

<p>He notes that kids today have more health problems than when he was young, and LazyTown's message of health and activity is vital. Magnus hopes to continue promoting this message and inspire a new generation of children.</p>

<h2>Reflections and Future Plans</h2>

<p>Magnus reflects on the possibility of <strong>new LazyTown content</strong>. He mentions that <strong>Sportacus is the 10th</strong> in a line, suggesting that there could be a <strong>Sportacus number 11</strong>. He is open to the idea of new formats, perhaps even a movie.</p>

<p>He also considers that <strong>younger people might bring fresh ideas to LazyTown</strong>. The kids who grew up watching the show think differently and could contribute to its evolution.</p>

<p>Currently, Magnus is involved in various projects:</p>

<ul>

<li>

<p><strong>Public Speaking:</strong> He travels the world giving speeches.</p>

</li>

<li>

<p><strong>Restaurant and Hotel:</strong> He owns a restaurant and hotel in Iceland.</p>

</li>

<li>

<p><strong>New TV Show:</strong> He is working on a thriller TV show that he has been developing for eight years.</p>

</li>

</ul>

<p>He mentions that there are plans to <strong>celebrate LazyTown's 30th anniversary</strong> by inviting everyone who worked on the show to reunite. They are also considering creating a <strong>LazyTown museum</strong> to preserve the show's history and share it with fans.</p>

<p>Magnus shares that they found old tapes and masters of behind-the-scenes footage that were thought to be lost in a fire. A company called KPMG had saved them, and they plan to go through the tapes to see what treasures they hold.</p>

<p>He is proud of what LazyTown stands for and the impact it has had on fans. Magnus maintains that everyone who worked on the show <strong>cared deeply</strong> about its message and quality.</p>
