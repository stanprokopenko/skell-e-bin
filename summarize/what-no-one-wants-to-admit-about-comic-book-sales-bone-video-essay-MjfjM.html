<h2>Following My Artistic Vision</h2>

<p>I admire how Jeff Smith refused to compromise his vision. He dreamed of creating a grand fantasy comic featuring his character Fone Bone. After being discouraged by newspaper syndicates who wanted another "Garfield," he discovered the potential of comic books through titles like <strong>"The Dark Knight Returns."</strong> Realizing he could self-publish, he launched <strong>"Bone"</strong> in 1991.</p>

<h2>Overcoming Challenges with Perseverance</h2>

<p>At first, "Bone" struggled with low sales. My wife, Vijaya, and I faced financial hardships, but we persisted. We marketed "Bone" as an <strong>all-ages</strong> book, even though some saw it as just for kids. Support from notable creators like <strong>Neil Gaiman</strong> helped boost its popularity. Vijaya took over the business side, allowing me to focus on my art.</p>

<h2>Making Comics Mainstream</h2>

<p>"Bone" caught the attention of <strong>Scholastic</strong>, a major children's publisher. Partnering with them allowed us to reach a wider audience. The colored editions of "Bone" became bestsellers, proving that graphic novels could succeed in mainstream markets. This success opened doors for other creators and shifted how comics were perceived, especially for younger readers.</p>
