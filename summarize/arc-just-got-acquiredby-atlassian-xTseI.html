<h2>What Happened</h2>

<p>The Browser Company, makers of Arc and DIA, was acquired by Atlassian for $610M. I walk through why they sold, why Atlassian bought, and what this means next.</p>

<h2>Why The Browser Company Needed To Sell</h2>

<p>Arc was a solid power user browser, but the company scaled like a hypergrowth startup without revenue.</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Team size:</strong> 140+ employees in NYC.</li>

<li><strong>Burn:</strong> ~$17M/year on salaries alone, likely ~$20M total.</li>

<li><strong>Revenue:</strong> Pre-revenue. Recent DIA memberships did not land.</li>

</ul>

<p>Funding history I found:

- 2020 seed (est. ~$20M valuation).

- 2021 Series A: $13M.

- 2023: $56.8M (Atlassian Ventures participated).

- 2024: $50M (Pace Capital). Valuation likely around ~$550M both rounds.

- <strong>Total raised:</strong> ~$128M.</p>

<p>Arc reportedly 4x’d users in 2024, but the company pivoted to <strong>DIA</strong>, a simpler, AI-centric browser targeting mainstream users. The problem: innovators and power users drove early growth, but they are hard to monetize. The mainstream rarely tries new browsers, and DIA’s signature features showed weak pull:

- Arc feature use: spaces 5.5%, live folders 4.1%, calendar hover 0.4%.

- DIA feature use, chat with tabs 40%, personalization 37%, high percentages on a small base.</p>

<p>With high burn, stalled monetization, and no clear growth story for another raise, an acquisition became the only path.</p>

<h2>Why Atlassian Bought</h2>

<p>Atlassian prints money but ships clunky software. They sell to enterprises that live in Jira, Confluence, Bitbucket, and endless SaaS tabs. Their angle:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Knowledge work in the browser</strong> is the work. Power users in support, safety, PM, and ops push browsers to the limit.</li>

<li><strong>Arc/DIA’s strengths:</strong> Chromium expertise, UI design, SwiftUI plus Windows work, AI-driven browsing.</li>

<li><strong>Strategy:</strong> Do not fix Jira. Build a layer above it. Use the browser plus AI to operate SaaS apps for you. Keep enterprise revenue even if users avoid Jira’s UI.</li>

</ul>

<h2>What’s Next</h2>

<p>Expect <strong>DIA integrated into Atlassian’s world</strong>: Windows support sooner, enterprise security, and custom AI models on telemetry. This is a hedge to make work in Atlassian’s ecosystem tolerable by making the browser smarter, not Jira better. Arc as we knew it is effectively over.</p>
