<h2>Why the Market Is Crashing</h2>

<h3>The Impact of Tariffs</h3>

<p>Currently, the market is experiencing a <strong>perfect storm</strong>, starting with <strong>tariffs</strong>. When tariffs are threatened or imposed, the market reacts with volatility. Initially, it drops but may recover when agreements are reached. Recent tariffs, such as the proposed <strong>25% tariff on steel and aluminum imports</strong> and potential tariffs on Canadian dairy and lumber, have created significant uncertainty. Retaliation from countries like Canada and China increases fears of higher prices, lower GDP, and a potential recession.</p>

<h3>Interest Rates and National Debt</h3>

<p>Another critical factor is the rising <strong>national debt</strong>, now over <strong>$36 trillion</strong>. With increasing <strong>interest rates</strong>, the cost of servicing this debt is soaring. For the first time in history, the U.S. is spending more on interest payments than on defense. By 2025, <strong>$9.2 trillion</strong> of debt needs refinancing, potentially at higher rates. There's a theory that market crashes may be <strong>orchestrated to lower interest rates</strong>, reducing the government's borrowing costs.</p>

<h2>Potential Severity of the Downturn</h2>

<h3>Market Corrections, Bear Markets, and Collapses</h3>

<p>You should be aware of the three types of market declines:</p>

<ul>

<li>

<p><strong>Market Correction</strong>: A drop of at least <strong>10%</strong>. Corrections are normal and occur every 16 months on average.</p>

</li>

<li>

<p><strong>Bear Market</strong>: A drop of at least <strong>20%</strong> from the peak. Bear markets typically last about a year, with an average decline of <strong>33.2%</strong>.</p>

</li>

<li>

<p><strong>Market Collapse</strong>: A severe drop of around <strong>40%</strong>. In the last 120 years, this has happened only three times.</p>

</li>

</ul>

<p>While market collapses are rare, it's important to <strong>prepare for the worst</strong>.</p>

<h2>How to Navigate the Market</h2>

<h3>Stay Invested Despite Fear</h3>

<p>There's always a reason <strong>not to invest</strong>, but historically, staying invested pays off. Even during downturns, consistently investing in index funds over the long term has proven successful. <strong>Market timing</strong> is challenging, and missing the market's best days can significantly reduce your returns.</p>

<h3>Avoid Overconfidence</h3>

<p>Overconfidence can destroy your portfolio. Recognize that <strong>keeping it simple</strong> often yields the best results. Regularly investing in diversified index funds and holding them for the long term is a proven strategy.</p>

<h3>Practice Good Financial Habits</h3>

<p><strong>Good financial habits</strong> are crucial in both good and bad markets. Continue to:</p>

<ul>

<li>Work extra hours or take on side hustles.</li>

<li>Cut unnecessary expenses.</li>

<li><strong>Live below your means</strong>.</li>

<li>Invest the difference.</li>

</ul>

<p>These practices will pay off significantly over time.</p>

<h3>Be Prepared for Market Volatility</h3>

<p>Market drops can be worse than expected. <strong>Stay the course</strong>, and remember that markets historically recover. <strong>Don't panic sell</strong>, instead, view downturns as opportunities to buy at lower prices.</p>

<p>Regardless of current market conditions, maintaining a disciplined investment strategy is key. By <strong>staying invested</strong>, avoiding overconfidence, and practicing good financial habits, you position yourself to <strong>weather the storm</strong> and potentially come out ahead when the market recovers.</p>
