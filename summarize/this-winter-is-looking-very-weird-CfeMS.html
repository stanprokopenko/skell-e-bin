<h2>Big picture</h2>

<p>This winter is a battle between a weak, faltering leninia and a shaky polar vortex. The Pacific pattern is barely there, with only a 42% chance it fully develops and 6 of 8 models favoring neutral conditions. Without a strong driver, the setup is fragile and easily disrupted.</p>

<p>Even so, the big long-range models agree on a split nation. Draw a line across the middle of the country:

- Southern tier: warmer and drier, about 2 to 4 degrees above normal and 20 to 40% below normal precipitation.

- Northern tier: colder and wetter with enhanced storm tracks, more Arctic intrusions, and more snow.</p>

<p>Where cold northern air meets warm southern air becomes the battleground for the biggest storms, heavy snow, and pockets of severe weather.</p>

<h2>Polar vortex wild card</h2>

<p>Up in the stratosphere, the polar vortex looks unstable. With leninia-like conditions and the current setup, there’s a 60 to 75% chance of a sudden stratospheric warming event. When this hits, Arctic air spills south:

- Temperatures 15 to 25 degrees below normal

- Wind chills to minus30, minus40, even minus50

- Impacts can last 4 to 8 weeks and override the base pattern</p>

<p>I’m expecting two to three major disruptions from January through early March.</p>

<h2>Regional outlook</h2>

<ul>

<li>

<p>Pacific Northwest: Cooler than normal looks most likely here with a 33 to 40% chance. Frequent atmospheric rivers. Cascades snowpack 20 to 40% above normal.</p>

</li>

<li>

<p>Northern Plains and Great Lakes: On the front lines of Arctic invasions. Lake-effect snow primed with 15 to 20 C air-water gaps. Southern shores of Lakes Superior and Michigan could see 20 to 40% above normal snowfall. More Alberta Clippers with frequent 3 to 6 inch events.</p>

</li>

<li>

<p>Southwest: 33 to 50% chance of above normal temperatures, persistent ridge, about 40% below normal precipitation. Ongoing drought likely worsens. Fire weather a big concern in Southern California.</p>

</li>

<li>

<p>Midwest and Ohio Valley: Storm track battleground. Freezing rain potential 35 to 40% above normal, especially from northern Texas into Oklahoma and maybe Missouri. Enhanced risk of winter severe weather and tornadoes. Expect weather whiplash.</p>

</li>

<li>

<p>Northeast: Exceptionally active. I’m calling for 6 to 9 significant nor’easters. NAO likely positive early (milder), then turning negative by February to March, bringing slower, stronger coastal storms. Peak activity late winter.</p>

</li>

<li>

<p>Southeast: Generally 2 to 4 degrees above normal and 20 to 30% below normal precipitation. Mostly quiet, but a few severe weather rounds possible. Brief cold shots if the vortex disrupts.</p>

</li>

</ul>

<h2>Timing and analogs</h2>

<p>Best analog: 2010–2011 with an 85% pattern match, plus 2007–2008 and 1998–1999. All featured memorable Arctic outbreaks.</p>

<h2>Bottom line</h2>

<p>Expect a volatile, high-contrast winter with a warm-dry south, a cold-snowy north, and a volatile battleground in between. Polar vortex disruptions could define the season.</p>
