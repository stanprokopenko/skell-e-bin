<p>I've been reflecting on how President Trump is addressing bad trade deals, which have hurt our economy. While free trade made the top 10% wealthier, especially those whose work involves only the mind, it left many blue-collar workers behind. We assumed we could shift from an industrial economy to an information one by outsourcing manufacturing to other countries.</p>

<h2>Key Mistakes of the 1990s</h2>

<p>In the 1990s, critical errors were made:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>China's entrance into the World Trade Organization (WTO)</strong></li>

<li><strong>Implementation of NAFTA</strong></li>

<li><strong>Repeal of regulations separating investment and commercial banks</strong></li>

</ul>

<p>These decisions led to the loss of American manufacturing jobs and economic imbalances.</p>

<h2>Impact on Different Classes</h2>

<p>As someone in the upper socioeconomic class, I recognize that I benefited from these policies. However, the working class faced job losses and economic hardships. Unions overreached, and corporations moved jobs overseas, prioritizing profits over American workers.</p>

<h2>President Trump's Approach</h2>

<p>President Trump is now <strong>correcting these mistakes</strong>. By imposing tariffs and challenging unfair trade practices, he's fulfilling his promises to the working class. While the stock market may experience volatility, these actions aim to bring back jobs and rebalance the economy.</p>

<h2>Balancing Risks and Rewards</h2>

<p>There's risk involved in this approach, but not acting would be worse. The working class has been demanding relief, and Trump's policies represent a commitment to them. It's a significant shift that may cause short-term discomfort but aims for long-term benefits for our country.</p>
