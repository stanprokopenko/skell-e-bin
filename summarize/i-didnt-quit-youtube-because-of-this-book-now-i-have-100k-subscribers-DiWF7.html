<h2>Understanding the Dip</h2>

<p>In early 2024, I almost quit YouTube due to frustration and lack of results. Then, I discovered Seth Godin's book <strong>"The Dip"</strong>. Reading it changed my perspective and convinced me to keep going. </p>

<p>Seth explains that <strong>everything worth doing is controlled by the dip</strong>. The dip is that period after initial excitement where progress slows down, and doubts creep in. Mastering the dip is crucial to achieving success.</p>

<h2>The Dip Is Your Friend</h2>

<p>I used to see the dip as the enemy. But Seth taught me that the dip is actually on our side, it's an audition for the real thing. It's what weeds out those who are not truly committed.</p>

<p>Without the dip, there would be no scarcity of the rewards we seek. If success were easy, everyone would achieve it, and it would lose its value. The dip ensures that only those who persevere and improve make it through.</p>

<h2>My Journey Through the Dip</h2>

<p>In 2021, I wasn't skilled enough to have 10,000 subscribers on YouTube. The dip forced me to invest in myself. I <strong>paid for training</strong>, <strong>hired mentors</strong>, and <strong>studied YouTube</strong> extensively. Over time, I improved my skills in packaging, thumbnails, and engaging viewers.</p>

<p>Similarly, in 2016, I lacked the experience to build a six-figure business. I freelanced for over 40 clients, learning the intricacies of business behind the scenes. By 2020, I was skilled enough, and my business hit six figures.</p>

<h2>Lessons Learned</h2>

<h3>Feel a Deep Calling</h3>

<p>To get through the dip, you must feel a <strong>deep calling</strong> to do what you're doing. External motivators like money aren't enough. It's the internal drive that keeps you going despite challenges.</p>

<h3>Embrace Small Improvements</h3>

<p>Small improvements that only you notice are all that matters. Even if progress seems invisible to others, those <strong>tiny 0.1% improvements</strong> add up over time. Focus on your direction, not your current position.</p>

<h3>Be Patient in Mastery</h3>

<p>We often underestimate how long it takes to get good at something. The dip ensures we develop the skills needed not just to achieve success but to maintain it. Be patient with yourself as you grow.</p>

<h2>Knowing When to Quit</h2>

<p>Seth says that <strong>winners quit all the time</strong>, they just quit the right things at the right time.</p>

<h3>Ask Yourself:</h3>

<ul>

<li><strong>Do you feel deeply called to do it?</strong> If yes, consider sticking with it.</li>

<li><strong>Do you love the process?</strong> Enjoying the journey is crucial.</li>

<li><strong>Is it hard in a good or bad way?</strong> ** Good challenges energize you, bad ones drain you.</li>

<li><strong>Will quitting free up time for better opportunities?</strong> Consider the opportunity cost.</li>

<li><strong>Are you avoiding quitting due to sunk costs?</strong> Don't let past investments trap you.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Preparing for the Dip</h2>

<p><strong>Anticipate the dip</strong> in whatever you pursue. To make it bearable:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Celebrate small wins</strong>, no matter how tiny.</li>

<li><strong>Surround yourself with others</strong> who are also pushing through.</li>

<li><strong>Remember that no one can take your skills away</strong>. Investing in yourself is always worthwhile.</li>

</ul>

<p>Consider creating a <strong>quitting contract</strong>. Write down the challenges you expect and set boundaries for yourself. Commit to a specific goal within your limits.</p>

<h2>Focusing on What Matters</h2>

<p>You can't do everything. Spreading yourself too thin is a disservice. <strong>It's easier to be the best at something specific</strong> than average at many things.</p>

<h3>Find Your Niche</h3>

<ul>

<li><strong>Specialize</strong>. For example, be a social media manager for cafes in Berlin instead of a generalist.</li>

<li><strong>Experiment strategically</strong>, but once you find your calling, <strong>go all in</strong>.</li>

<li><strong>Make decisive choices</strong>. Even wrong decisions provide valuable lessons.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Embrace the Dip</h2>

<p>Look for the dip in your journey, it's a good sign. If progress is slow, but there's potential, you're on the right path. The dip weeds out those who aren't committed, leaving space for those who persist.</p>

<p>Remember, <strong>the dip is the shortcut</strong>. The only way out is through.</p>
