<h2>The Evolution of Internet Search</h2>

<p>AI is transforming how we interact with the internet. For decades, we started by typing queries into Google and sifting through blue links to find answers. This method drove clicks to websites and formed the backbone of the internet's business model.</p>

<p>Now, <strong>AI-powered summaries</strong> are changing that. Instead of browsing links, users receive direct answers generated by AI. This shift threatens traditional search economics that many businesses rely on.</p>

<h2>Apple's Move Towards AI Search Engines</h2>

<p>In the Google antitrust case, Apple revealed plans to revamp Safari to focus on <strong>AI-powered search engines</strong>. Senior VP of Services, Eddy Cue, believes AI search providers like <strong>OpenAI</strong>, <strong>Perplexity</strong>, and <strong>Anthropic</strong> will eventually replace traditional Google search.</p>

<p>Cue mentioned that while these AI search options may not become the default immediately, Apple intends to add them to Safari's lineup. Search volume on Safari declined for the first time ever last month, which Cue attributes to increased AI use.</p>

<p>He acknowledges that AI search isn't perfect yet but expects significant improvements soon. Apple plans to integrate AI search options into Safari by the end of the year.</p>

<h2>Impact on Google's Business Model</h2>

<p>This development has significant implications for Google. The market reacted sharply to Cue's testimony, with Google shares dropping over 8%. Investors fear that Google didn't move quickly enough in the AI space, and the <strong>innovator's dilemma</strong> is hitting home.</p>

<p>Some analysts are skeptical about the immediate impact. They suggest that Apple's position might be strategic, perhaps to downplay the importance of their search deal with Google in the antitrust trial.</p>

<h2>Changing Monetization of the Internet</h2>

<p>Matthew Prince, CEO of Cloudflare, discussed how AI is altering the internet's business model. As AI provides direct answers, users no longer need to visit external websites. This change undermines value for content creators who rely on traffic for ad revenue or subscriptions.</p>

<p>Prince concluded that the business model of the web can't survive without significant changes. The traditional reliance on search-driven traffic is eroding, and new models need to emerge.</p>

<h2>OpenAI's Restructuring Deal with Microsoft</h2>

<p>OpenAI is attempting to restructure its deal with Microsoft. They want to reduce Microsoft's share of revenue from 20% to 10% by 2030. The current agreement includes a 49% share of profits capped at $92 billion.</p>

<p>Microsoft hasn't agreed to the new terms yet, and some see OpenAI's expectations as overly optimistic. The outcome of these negotiations could have significant implications for both companies.</p>

<h2>Microsoft Adopts Google's Agent-to-Agent Standard</h2>

<p>Microsoft announced support for Google's <strong>Agent-to-Agent (A2A)</strong> standard on platforms like <strong>Azure AI Foundry</strong> and <strong>Copilot Studio</strong>. A2A is a protocol that allows AI agents to communicate with each other.</p>

<p>By aligning on standards like A2A, companies ensure that AI models are interchangeable and work across platforms. This collaboration reflects a broader industry push for openness and interoperability in AI development.</p>

<h2>Zuckerberg's Vision for an AI-Powered Ad Platform</h2>

<p>Mark Zuckerberg shared plans to build a fully automated <strong>AI ad platform</strong>. His vision is for businesses to state their objectives and budgets, and the AI system handles the rest, creating, testing, and optimizing ads across Meta's networks.</p>

<p>Some in the advertising industry are skeptical, believing that AI can't replicate human creativity. However, Zuckerberg focuses on efficiency in <strong>direct response advertising</strong>, not branding or high-concept campaigns.</p>

<p>I believe automating ad processes could greatly benefit small businesses, making advertising more accessible and effective.</p>
