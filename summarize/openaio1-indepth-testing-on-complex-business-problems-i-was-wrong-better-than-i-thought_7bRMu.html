<p>Hello everyone, and welcome to another episode. I'm Samer, your host, and today I want to revisit something we discussed recently.</p>

<p>In my previous episode, I talked about the <strong>Chat GPT-4 01 Preview</strong> model. I shared my initial impressions after testing it with some business problems. To be honest, I wasn't that impressed. The responses were good, but not quite what I expected, especially given the hype around this new model.</p>

<p>After I posted that episode, I received a lot of feedback from you all. Many of you suggested that my prompts might not have been <strong>optimized</strong>, which could have led to <strong>mediocre responses</strong> from the model. Others pointed out concepts like <strong>chain-of-thought</strong>, <strong>reinforced learning</strong>, and <strong>human feedback</strong>, suggesting that understanding these could improve the results.</p>

<h2>Giving Chat GPT-4 01 Another Shot</h2>

<p>Taking your feedback to heart, I decided to give the model another chance. This time, I wanted to put it through a more <strong>detailed and complex business case</strong> to truly test its capabilities. My goal was to see if the issue was with my prompts or if the model wasn't as advanced as I'd hoped.</p>

<h2>Presenting the Supply Chain Crisis Scenario</h2>

<p>I crafted a comprehensive supply chain crisis scenario involving a fictional company called <strong>Global Tech Innovations (GTI)</strong>. Here's the breakdown:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Company Overview</strong>: GTI is a leading multinational technology corporation known for its cutting-edge <strong>AI-powered smartphones</strong>.</li>

<li><strong>Dependency</strong>: The company heavily relies on the advanced <strong>QSS A5 chip</strong>, a 5-nanometer semiconductor chip manufactured by <strong>Quantum Semiconductor Solutions (QSS)</strong> in Taiwan.</li>

<li><strong>Challenges</strong>:<ul>

<li><strong>Geopolitical tensions</strong> and <strong>water shortages</strong> in Taiwan threaten the chip supply.</li>

<li><strong>New environmental regulations</strong> in the EU require GTI to improve its <strong>ESG scores</strong>.</li>

<li><strong>Competitive Market</strong>: Facing stiff competition from giants like <strong>Apple X</strong> (30% market share), <strong>Samsung AI</strong> (25%), and <strong>Huawei Tech</strong> (20%).</li>

<li><strong>Financial Impact</strong>: A potential <strong>20% reduction in production capacity</strong> could lead to a <strong>$12 billion revenue loss</strong> in 2023.</li>

</ul>

</li>

<li><strong>Supply Chain Details</strong>:<ul>

<li>Manufacturing centers in <strong>China</strong>, <strong>Vietnam</strong>, and <strong>India</strong>.</li>

<li>Distribution centers in the <strong>US</strong>, <strong>Germany</strong>, and <strong>Singapore</strong>.</li>

<li>An optimized <strong>just-in-time delivery</strong> system, now under threat due to supply issues.</li>

</ul>

</li>

</ul>

<h2>Testing the Model with the Detailed Problem</h2>

<p>I inputted this detailed scenario into <strong>Chat GPT-4 01 Preview</strong> with the following prompt:</p>

<p><em>"You are the CEO of the company with the above problem details as your context. I need you to consider this problem in all its details and come up with an immediate crisis management plan with specific actions, numbers, and budgets to enable the business to survive the issue as explained above."</em></p>

<p>I wanted to see if the model could <strong>think critically</strong> and provide a comprehensive solution, complete with actionable steps, financial figures, and strategic reasoning.</p>

<h2>The Model's Comprehensive Response</h2>

<p>To my surprise, the model delivered an impressively detailed crisis management plan. Here's what it came up with:</p>
