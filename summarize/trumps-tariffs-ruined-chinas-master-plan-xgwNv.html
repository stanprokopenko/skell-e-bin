<p>I've noticed that the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) is panicking over US tariffs, calling them <strong>"abuse"</strong> and <strong>"blackmail"</strong>. They claim to defend global trade, but they've spent decades manipulating it for their own gain.</p>

<h2>China's Export Reliance</h2>

<p>China's economy depends on exporting manufactured goods. After joining the WTO in 2001, their manufacturing boomed. While this provided cheaper goods to consumers, it caused massive job losses in other countries. The US alone lost over <strong>two million jobs</strong> due to Chinese imports between 1999 and 2011.</p>

<h2>Overcapacity Crisis</h2>

<p>When China's real estate market faltered in 2020, the CCP doubled down on manufacturing, leading to severe <strong>overcapacity</strong>, which means they're producing more goods than the world can consume. To offload this surplus, China slashes prices, undercutting industries around the globe.</p>

<h2>Unfair Trade Practices</h2>

<p>The CCP cheats WTO rules to <strong>dominate global trade</strong>. Here's how they do it:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Subsidies</strong>: They provide direct government funding to favored industries.</li>

<li><strong>Tax Breaks</strong>: They grant tax exemptions to selected companies.</li>

<li><strong>Cheap Financing</strong>: State-owned banks offer low-interest loans.</li>

<li><strong>Underpriced Resources</strong>: They supply land and utilities at below-market prices.</li>

<li><strong>Controlled Banking</strong>: State banks keep lending to unprofitable firms, inflating debt.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Tariff Evasion</h2>

<p>To dodge tariffs, China resorts to <strong>transshipment</strong>, rerouting goods through other countries to change labels. For instance, Chinese honey is relabeled elsewhere to bypass US tariffs, a scheme known as <strong>"honey laundering"</strong>.</p>

<h2>Global Trade Disruption</h2>

<p>The CCP's practices are <strong>destroying global trade</strong>. Other nations are fighting back with tariffs on Chinese goods, risking a collapse of global free trade. Without access to global markets, China's economy and the CCP's power are in jeopardy.</p>
