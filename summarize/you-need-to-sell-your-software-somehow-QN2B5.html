<p>Creating engaging short-form content has been a cornerstone of my work. Over the past two years, I've crafted over 600 videos and reached nearly a million followers. Let me share my <strong>five-step process</strong> for content creation: <strong>Clipping</strong>, <strong>Threading</strong>, <strong>Composing</strong>, <strong>Filming</strong>, and <strong>Editing</strong>.</p>

<h2>Step 1: Clipping</h2>

<p>I gather inspiration by clipping interesting content using <strong>MyMind</strong>. This tool lets me save anything I find online, tweets, images, articles, to a <strong>central location</strong>. This ongoing process ensures all my ideas are stored for easy access later.</p>

<h2>Step 2: Threading</h2>

<p>Next, I move on to <strong>threading</strong>. In <strong>Notion</strong>, I organize these clippings, grouping related ideas and adding my thoughts. This helps me <strong>build connections</strong> between different pieces of content. By threading ideas together, I start to see potential video topics.</p>

<h2>Step 3: Composing</h2>

<p>With threaded ideas, I proceed to <strong>composing</strong>. I use AI tools like <strong>Claude</strong> to transform these threads into a <strong>script</strong>. Including relevant images or videos, the AI crafts a narrative that suits my style. This turns raw ideas into a structured script ready for filming. I'm working on an app to streamline this process further.</p>

<h2>Step 4: Filming</h2>

<p>For filming, I use <strong>PromptSmart</strong>, a <strong>teleprompter</strong> app. I upload my script, and as I record, the app scrolls the text in sync with my speech. This lets me maintain a natural flow while covering all my points. I focus on bringing <strong>energy</strong> and <strong>personality</strong> to engage viewers.</p>

<h2>Step 5: Editing</h2>

<p>Editing is simple with <strong>Descript</strong>, which lets me edit videos by editing text. I import my recording, and Descript transcribes it. I can cut filler words, remove pauses, and add captions or images seamlessly. Overlaying videos or images enhances the visual appeal without complex software.</p>

<h2>Enhancing with AI</h2>

<p>AI-generated content often lacks <strong>personal context</strong>. To fix this, I train the AI on my own voice and opinions. By feeding it my ideas, the AI composes scripts that reflect my style. This personalization is key to producing content that resonates with my audience.</p>

<p>By following this five-step process, I create engaging short-form content efficiently. From clipping ideas in <strong>MyMind</strong> to threading them in <strong>Notion</strong>, composing scripts with <strong>AI</strong>, filming with <strong>PromptSmart</strong>, and editing in <strong>Descript</strong>, each step is streamlined. I'm developing an app to integrate these steps into a single platform, making content creation even easier. This approach lets me focus on what matters most: sharing valuable insights with my audience.</p>
