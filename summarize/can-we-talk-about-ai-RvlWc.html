<h2>The Debate on AI in Art</h2>

<p>I've been thinking a lot about <strong>AI and its impact on art</strong>. There's a heated debate: some say <strong>AI is harmful to artists</strong>, stealing jobs and training on stolen data without consent. Others argue that <strong>AI democratizes creativity</strong>, allowing more people to engage in innovation than ever before.</p>

<h2>Navigating the Conversation</h2>

<p>I understand both sides. <strong>AI is being developed without our permission</strong>, and corporations profit from our hard work. The environmental impact is also a concern, as AI consumes massive amounts of energy. Yet, proponents believe <strong>AI can lead to solutions</strong> for climate change, disease, and create new avenues for creativity.</p>

<p><strong>The hardest part about discussing AI is listening</strong>. It's a divisive topic, and conversations often become polarized. I don't want to argue for or against AI art outright. Instead, I want to dwell in the uncomfortable gray area where we can have a productive dialogue.</p>

<h2>My Journey with AI and Art</h2>

<p><strong>I've always considered myself a creativity futurist</strong>. Since I was 11, I've been at the forefront of where technology and creativity intersect. From digital art and animation to virtual reality and even drawing robots, I've embraced emerging technologies. When AI art first emerged, I was enthralled.</p>

<p>Over the years, I experimented with AI tools, finding them fun and exciting. But as AI advanced, the <strong>controversy around ethics</strong> grew. Artists spoke out about how AI models were trained on their work without consent, affecting an already challenging career path. Recognizing this, I stepped back to reflect on my stance.</p>

<h2>How I Use AI in My Work</h2>

<p>It's been almost two years since I stopped making AI-related content. Yet, <strong>AI is more present than ever</strong>, and the conversation hasn't gotten any easier. I haven't shared my opinions publicly because it's uncomfortable and divisive. But I believe it's important to talk about it.</p>

<p><strong>Here's how I use AI art</strong>: I incorporate it into my early processes, brainstorming, conceptualization, and expanding the scope of projects. For example, in developing a roleplay system, I used AI to create initial concept art. This helped get the ball rolling, but we replaced the AI art with original artwork later on.</p>

<p>I work with Alicia, an artist who has been with us for over three years. <strong>AI hasn't reduced her workload</strong>. In fact, it's provided more opportunities. Using AI allowed us to create an animated intro for a series that we would not have been able to produce otherwise. AI expanded our scope without overwhelming our resources.</p>

<h2>Ethical Concerns and Personal Reflections</h2>

<p>I share this for transparency. <strong>I'm not an enemy of art</strong>, I'm passionate about creating and sharing. Does using AI in these ways make me a hypocrite? Maybe. But I want to have an open conversation about it. Perhaps my position will change with more education.</p>

<p><strong>I believe AI art is not a craft</strong>. You can't call yourself an artist if your work is built on AI-generated content any more than you can if you're tracing someone else's work. However, I find AI art interesting and exciting, even if I feel I'm not allowed to say that.</p>

<p><strong>The real issue lies with corporations</strong> and the capitalist system that exploits artists' work without consent or transparency. AI can be damaging in manipulative hands, but it also has the potential to propel humanity forward in unprecedented ways.</p>

<h2>A Call for Open Dialogue</h2>

<p>In short, <strong>I'm firmly on the fence</strong>. It's hard to know where to begin discussing this because of how heated it gets. But AI will continue to develop and be misused whether we engage with it or not. Ignoring it only allows harm to continue unchecked.</p>

<p>I get it. <strong>This is uncomfortable</strong>. But the division and extremism aren't helping. I want to explore AI and its impact thoughtfully, perhaps even creating a comprehensive piece interviewing those affected and those developing the technology. But that's a big commitment.</p>

<p>So, <strong>I'm asking: Can we talk about AI?</strong> Can we have a respectful, productive conversation about it? I hope you're willing to join me in this dialogue.</p>
