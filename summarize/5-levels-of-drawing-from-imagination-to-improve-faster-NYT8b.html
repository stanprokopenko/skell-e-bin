<h2>What Drawing From Imagination Really Is</h2>

<p>When I draw from imagination, I’m not skipping construction. I’m manipulating <strong>form in perspective</strong> and calculating framing and shaping in my head. Pros can do this after decades of practice. For the rest of us, I train it with five progressive levels that build the same skills.</p>

<h2>The 5 Levels</h2>

<p>1) Level 1: Basic Forms in Space<br />

I isolate perspective and form. I practice simple primitives in perspective and organize them in three ways: <strong>circulating</strong>, <strong>clustered/stacking</strong>, and <strong>expanding in space</strong>. I use a forgiving medium (pencil or ballpoint) and focus on clear volume. This is already drawing from imagination and becomes the foundation for objects like cars and buildings.</p>

<p>2) Level 2: Sketching (Iterative)<br />

I draw loosely and iteratively. I change my ideas as I go, correct lines, and erase. Pencil or ballpoint works best. This is the standard workflow for many pros and often yields the best results because I can test and improve decisions.</p>

<p>3) Level 3: Preconstruction<br />

I pre-place <strong>boxes</strong> or <strong>mannequins</strong> to lock in perspective and form, then draw the scene on top. This reduces what I must juggle in my head. I’m more decisive here (often with a brush pen), but I can be loose while setting up the structure. I scale difficulty by how detailed my boxes/mannequins are. More info equals more consistent figures.</p>

<p>4) Level 4: Assisted Freehand<br />

I remove form scaffolding and keep only a <strong>perspective grid</strong> (or even just a <strong>horizon line</strong>). I must draw forms and anatomy directly. I track vanishing points, horizon, and scale. Useful rule: anything crossing the horizon line stays aligned across the scene (for example, seated characters’ mouths aligning with the horizon). I scale difficulty by how detailed the grid is.</p>

<p>5) Level 5: Direct Freehand<br />

Blank page. I rely on everything I practiced. At minimum, I imagine a <strong>horizon line</strong> to ground the scene and scale. I draw whatever comes to mind and apply the perspective rules.</p>

<h2>How I Practice</h2>

<ul>

<li>I don’t move through levels strictly. I jump between them to challenge my brain at different difficulties.  </li>

<li>I constantly <strong>draw through forms</strong>, deconstruct objects, and understand volume in space.  </li>

<li>I scale complexity in Levels 3 and 4 by adjusting how much structure or grid I give myself.  </li>

<li>I always practice <strong>observation</strong>. Drawing from imagination only uses what I’ve studied.</li>
